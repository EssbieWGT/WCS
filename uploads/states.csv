The other tracts, also largely vacant, would be readied and prepared to attract other industry and business. While the park’s development team says it is in the process of acquiring three sites, other land buys could follow.
“We’re not stopping there. We’re continuing to look at other sites,” said Michael Maroney of Omaha Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit working on the business park venture with partners including the Omaha Inland Port Authority.
The update on the business park — and other state funding-fueled projects poised to emerge within the 3,000 acres governed by the port authority in northeast Omaha and near Eppley Airfield — came Tuesday at a community briefing hosted by OIPA executive director Garry Clark.
Nearly 80 people came, including speakers Mayor John Ewing Jr., Greater Omaha Chamber CEO Heath Mello and State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, who also is president of the OIPA board.
 $11 million stall 

In another key update, McKinney said he was optimistic there soon would be a breakthrough on the roughly $11 million in interest funds the State of Nebraska has not yet turned over to the OIPA.
As previously reported by the Nebraska Examiner, the port authority, backed by Ewing and Mello, sent an Oct. 20 letter seeking the immediate release of state funds it said are due to the authority under state statute.
Port authority leaders say state is withholding funds, slowing economic progress in northeast Omaha

OIPA had requested the installment in July. Nebraska’s state treasurer at the time resisted, according to the letter. Newly installed State Treasurer Joey Spellerberg set up a meeting to discuss the matter this week, and Clark said he, too, was optimistic.
Without those dollars, Clark and McKinney said, a couple of on-deck initiatives could not launch as planned. In collaboration with expert partner groups, the port authority seeks to implement a program that helps residents in the district repair, improve and own homes. 
The group also plans to seed an entrepreneurial fund and revolving loan in which businesses and startups could access dollars to help create jobs and build wealth in the community.
Clark described those efforts as “low-hanging fruit” that could get moving relatively quickly and spur momentum for the relatively new port authority district. The group’s nine-member board was installed in 2024. It hired Clark as executive director this summer. 
 Modular, 3-D, timber housing 

Currently, the port authority oversees about $120 million in state investment: $90 million for the business park and $30 million for an innovation district.
The $90 million previously appropriated by the Nebraska Legislature was intended to develop shovel-ready ground that would lure new jobs and commerce to historically disenfranchised neighborhoods of north and east Omaha.

A group led by Maroney, Burlington Capital and the Omaha Chamber was awarded the grant for the park in early 2024, and immediately faced criticism in part from residents stunned to learn their homes appeared to be in the path of the project.
Since then, the development team has vowed not to pursue residential property for the business park project. It also has pivoted from an earlier focus on a single larger site to multiple campuses.
Clark said discussions are underway to transform one of the sites into a “creative housing” hub where construction technology-focused workers might develop nontraditional housing in the form of modular, 3-D or cross laminated timber structures. He said it could help the local housing shortage, as well as provide commercial products to distribute elsewhere.
Maroney said his team currently has three noncontiguous sites under option to buy and is in a “due diligence phase.” One property is near 14th and Locust Streets, a possibility that had been aired previously but downplayed because of environmental cleanup expenses. 
He declined to name the two other sites until the process was further along. The OIPA board must approve the purchases.











“This is a true opportunity for shifting the narrative. 


– Garry Clark, Omaha Inland Port Authority



On the $30 million for a more techy innovation district, a consultant hired to frame the development process is to present its plan for approval by the OIPA board yet this year. The consultant has been gathering input from community members and other sources the past several months.
At Tuesday’s meeting, Clark recognized then-State Sen. Justin Wayne of North Omaha for championing the initial legislation five years ago that allowed for the creation of five inland port authorities across Nebraska, joining others nationwide. Wayne was unable to attend, officials said, due to previously scheduled travel.
The group also recognized Gov. Jim Pillen with a certificate, though he was unable to attend.
 ‘Shifting the narrative’

To help carry out the Omaha port authority operations, Wayne and McKinney helped secure additional dollars from the Legislature by directing interest from several state funding pots, including the Perkins County Canal and new prison projects. That is where the first $11 million installment is to come from.

In providing an overview of port authority activity, Clark told the group that pioneers in Omaha’s north and east neighborhoods fought for equity and economic opportunity but faced barriers such as redlining and lack of resources.
“This is a true opportunity for shifting the narrative,” he said.
Ewing said the port authority is poised to help carry out one of his goals as mayor.
“This is what intentional economic development looks like,” he said.



What is an inland port authority
Inland port authorities were intended as a tool to help stimulate jobs and businesses. Nebraska lawmakers bestowed powers on such entities, which must be approved by the state as well as the city, that include selling bonds to finance construction and infrastructure within the designated zone.
Legislative tweaks in 2024 gave the Omaha port authority additional muscle and funding sources. The Omaha entity also is obligated to construct at least 150 new apartments and 20 new houses within the boundaries. 
Omaha’s port authority boundaries cover nearly 3,000 acres in northeast Omaha and near Eppley Airfield. Its leaders say it contains about 15,000 households, 984 vacant lots and 377 acres of developable land. They say the average income is about $34,000.

Spencer Cox speaks during an artificial intelligence summit on Dec, 2, 2025. (Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)Government should not be telling tech companies how to develop their artificial intelligence, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox says, but it must be in the business of protecting children.
“The minute you decide to use those tools to give my kid a sexualized chat bot, then it’s my business and it’s the government’s business, and we are going to get involved,” he told a room full of tech executives at an AI Summit the Utah Department of Commerce hosted on Tuesday.
Cox has had a long complicated relationship with social media and artificial intelligence. And, while he doesn’t believe the government should be telling companies how to develop technology, he said he believes it must dictate some limits.

And the federal government should not interfere with that effort, he said. 
“However much you hate social media, you do not hate it enough. You do not hate these companies enough,” he said.
His remarks came just days after 12 Republican Utah lawmakers signed a letter urging Congress to reject a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act that would allow the federal government to preempt state and local governments on AI regulations. 
Deepfakes, policing, mental health and more: Lawmakers look to further regulate AI

In the letter, state lawmakers said that in an “increasingly fraught digital environment” there are new risks for youth and seniors online. A federal preemption would leave communities exposed and could “nullify a wide range of laws that states have already adopted to address urgent digital issues.”
“I would much prefer that we had a Congress that could actually pass a bill, that could actually do something that could function the way it was designed to function,” Cox said. “But if it is not going to function, then the states must act, and we must have the ability to do that, and we will fight for that ability to do that.”
However, arguing that these technologies have the potential to solve big problems in society, Cox announced a “pro-AI initiative,” meant to look at the technology’s impacts on workforce, industry, state government, academia, public policy and education.
“The core element asks us to prioritize human leadership in the age of AI, ensuring that AI remains understandable in how it functions, accountable in its impacts and adaptable to human needs, rather than the other way around,” he said. “And the second core element is that AI must be human-enhancing. It should expand our capabilities, not diminish them.”
The state is planning on spending $10 million for a workforce accelerator initiative that will support AI in the state, Cox said. That would include curriculum expansions for AI research, energy, semiconductors, quantum computing and advanced materials both in higher education institutions and K-12.
An AI-loaded 2026 session
After creating a state office to regulate AI and foster innovation in 2024, Republican lawmakers have big plans to boost AI regulations during the 2026 legislative session.
“In this next session, and coming up, you’re going to see much more work with our state Legislature,” Cox said. “We’re going to be looking at harm reduction in AI companions, transparency around deep fakes, and an upcoming study around data ownership and control more broadly, as well as the interaction with AI and health care.”



Let us know what you think...


 


Also, a big focus will be preventing anti-competitive actions by big tech companies, an issue Utah lawmakers started to work on this year, when they approved the first law in the nation to push tech companies towards interoperability, allowing users to own their own data
“We need to make sure that we don’t end up with five AI companies. We need thousands of AI companies in this country,” Cox said. 
Rep. Ariel Defay, R-Kaysville said during a panel on Tuesday that she will sponsor legislation aiming to regulate deep fakes and AI companions. She’s also expected to draft a bill titled “the balanced technology in classrooms act,” which stems from her concerns of AI use in the education system, she said.
“I want all the districts, all the (local education agencies), to have the conversation,” Defay said. “Are we correctly balancing the use of technology in our classrooms? And that includes tech and AI.”

Gallatin County health officials confirmed a new case of measles in the county this week.
On Monday, health officials confirmed a case, reported on Nov. 28, of an individual who had a known exposure to measles at a public site. Heath officials are working to identity and notice individuals who may have been exposed.
A list of public exposure locations, and a timeline for individuals to monitor for symptoms, is available here.
This was the second recorded measles case in the county in the last month. Gallatin County has recorded 21 cases of measles this year, the most of any Montana county.
On Tuesday, Missoula County health officials put out a public notice of potential measles exposure in the county from a visiting individual on Saturday, Nov. 22. No positive cases have been confirmed in the county, according to the news release.
Health officials list three times and public locations the infected individual visited and asks anyone who visited the same places on Nov. 22 to monitor for symptoms:

11 a.m. -2:30 p.m., Missoula TJ Maxx
12 p.m. -3:30 p.m., Missoula Scheels
1 p.m. – 4 p.m., Missoula Old Chicago.


Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that spreads when an infected individual coughs, sneezes or talks. Measles can also be spread through touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the mouth, nose or eyes. Symptoms typically begin with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body.

Individuals who are immune to measles through vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or were born before 1957 are not considered at risk for infection. Individuals without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.
If you are unsure of your vaccination status, here are a few places you can review:


Call your old high school, college, or university and ask if they have vaccination records.
Contact your doctor’s office, urgent care, or pediatrician. Even if you have not been there in years, they may still have records.
Reach out to the health department where you grew up.
Check your home state immunization registries.

A measles infection is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.
Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. Cases in the U.S. are generally rare but have been increasing in recent years.
The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97% to 99% effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.
If you are in need of the MMR vaccine, please call your primary care physician as soon as possible.

Her last day will be Jan. 9. Gov. Jared Polis will announce her replacement before then.
“Under her leadership, Colorado has made major progress in breaking down barriers to help more students from all backgrounds access the training and education needed to succeed and drive our economy forward. Angie’s hard work and dedication has created a foundation that we will continue building on for learners and workers at all levels,” Polis said in a statement.

Paccione has been the department’s executive director since 2019 and led it through the major disruptions to higher education caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The department works to expand and support education opportunities after high school in the state, including credential programs, workforce development and college enrollment.
Under her leadership, Colorado began the Re-Engaged (CORE) Initiative, which allows four-year institutions in the state to give associate degrees to students who stopped working towards their bachelor’s degree but have at least 70 credit hours. She also oversaw the start of the FosterEd program that pays the college costs for students who were in foster care.
“For me, this work has always been about activating the potential in every student. Over the past seven years, we have expanded opportunity, strengthened workforce readiness, and unlocked personal fulfillment for Colorado’s learners,” Paccione said in a statement.
Paccione served two terms in the Colorado House of Representatives between 2003 and 2007, and became the Democratic minority caucus chair.
She plans to take a job in the private sector, according to the governor’s office.

(Photo by Micah Drew)The U.S. government already fixed the problem over which a couple of Montana State University international students sued, so a federal judge should toss the lawsuit the students filed against it in fear of deportation, argued the U.S. Attorney’s Office in federal court Tuesday.
But a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana said without a court order, the students remain in a precarious position, worried about future deportation and subject to yet another policy change that harms them in the future.
The lawyers made their arguments in U.S. District Court of Montana in Missoula on the government’s motion to dismiss the case, one similar to numerous lawsuits across the country in response to a Trump administration policy that resulted in stripped visa statuses for many international students.
In May, federal Judge Dana Christensen of Montana issued an order that prohibited the government from arresting or deporting the MSU students based on the status of their federal records relevant in the case, now pending with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
On behalf of the U.S. Attorney’s Office, however, John Newman told the judge the case should be considered moot. He said an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 international students across the country had similar experiences, and as many as 15% sued.
He said the Department of Homeland Security already reversed course for all of those students and abandoned its “ill-conceived and ineffective” initiative, one court records said meant students were “expected to depart the United States immediately.”
As such, Newman argued the judge should dismiss the case because the plaintiffs are no longer harmed, and the government doesn’t plan to take the same actions again.
In April 2025, the MSU students learned the records of their F-1 statuses in a federal Student Exchange Visitor Information System were terminated, which meant they couldn’t stay enrolled in classes, would lose employment authorization, and were subject to arrest and deportation.
The F-1 visa allows noncitizens to enter the United States as students to attend certified academic institutions, and after a year of study, engage in internships, practicums or other work-study off campus that’s related to their fields.
The students sued Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, alleging the defendants unlawfully terminated their records, and Christensen issued a temporary restraining order and later injunction against the federal government.
But the government also reinstated the students’ records, as the court learned at an April 29 hearing, and Newman said Tuesday the students are free to sue again if they believe they are harmed in the future. But he said the current matter is settled.
“The plan is not to do this ever again because frankly, it was a disaster,” Newman said. “It didn’t accomplish any of the goals that I assume were intended.”
On behalf of the two MSU students, however, Alex Rate of the ACLU of Montana said the government terminated the students’ records contrary to its own code, based on interactions with law enforcement, but without a conviction or a prison sentence of more than one year, as required.
Court records state one plaintiff was charged with theft, and one with partner family member assault, but both pleaded not guilty, neither has been convicted, and neither case came with that amount of prison time anyway.
But the U.S. government still has “enormous discretion” in deciding what triggers a records termination in the future, and without an order from the court, the students remain vulnerable, Rate said.
The government states it has no plans to terminate records in the same way again, but that’s not a commitment, Rate said. He said the government also has not produced an unequivocal policy, just a message with a disclaimer, and one that’s easily changed in the future.
In the meantime, the federal government has made it clear that the likelihood immigrants and international students will continue to be in the crosshairs is high, Rate said. So he said the students need a court order to ensure they can study without worrying about deportation.
The case was filed by John Roe and Jane Doe on April 14; Roe, of Iran, was pursuing a doctorate degree in electrical engineering, and Doe, of Turkey, was seeking a master’s degree in microbiology, according to court records.
Rate said Roe continues to pursue his doctorate at MSU and expects to graduate in the next 12 months, and Doe graduated with a master’s degree and remains in the United States working through the Optional Practical Training program.
With its earlier policy, the government tried to “scare people into self-deportation,” and it nearly succeeded with one MSU student, Rate said.
“One of my clients had purchased a ticket to go say goodbye forever to his sister in Colorado because he was going to self-deport to Iran and had no expectation of ever returning to the United States,” Rate said.
To suggest the students can simply file a lawsuit if something goes wrong for them again doesn’t take their actual lives into consideration, he said.
Rate said it was “only by a miracle” the students connected with lawyers who could help in this case, and there’s no guarantee they’d have the same resources to find counsel and vet a potential lawsuit in the future.
Rate said only the court can offer his clients the security that they won’t face termination again; certainly the U.S. officials who axed their records in the first place — and could do so again — can’t offer that assurance.
“It wasn’t just my clients,” he said. “As my colleague noted, it was thousands of students all across the country, and it was only after emergency litigation that the government reversed course.”
On behalf of the government, however, Newman said the argument from the students amounted to “what if something else bad happens,” and he said that amounted to speculation. He said it’s understandable, but it’s also outside the bounds of the lawsuit.
“I can understand their concern for that given the climate,” Newman said. “But that’s a different case.”
Christensen said he would get a ruling out as soon as he could.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Russell-Courthouse-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-12-02 18:58:09.915808

This story by Clare Shanahan was first published in the Valley News on Dec. 1, 2025.
HANOVER — More than 40,000 people in Vermont and New Hampshire may have been impacted by a data breach in a system used by Dartmouth College. Last week, Dartmouth started mailing letters to the people whose personal information was included in data stolen over three days in early August.
During that time, an “unauthorized actor” was able to access Dartmouth College files and take data, including “one or more” files that had personal information such as names, Social Security numbers and financial account information, according to reports Dartmouth filed with the offices of the attorneys general of New Hampshire and Vermont last week.
The breach was part of a widespread attack on the Oracle eBusiness Suite, a platform Dartmouth and many other companies use to manage operations. A ransomware group has been taking credit for the attack and it has identified more than 100 companies impacted by the breach, according to reporting from SecurityWeek.
“This incident was not the result of any ‘phishing’ attack on a member of the Dartmouth community or any other action or inaction on Dartmouth’s part,” college spokesperson Jana Barnello said.
After Oracle reported the security breach in early October, Dartmouth launched an investigation “as quickly as possible” to identify the impacted data and respond, Barnello said Monday. It “took time” to review all of the files and identify the people whose information was exposed, Barnello said of the gap between when the Oracle breach was announced and when Dartmouth reported it.
The college reviewed the leaked files and identified that “one or more” contained personal information such as Social Security numbers on Oct. 30, according to the filings. 
In response to the breach, Dartmouth implemented “all publicly available patches” for the program to shore up any issues, per Oracle’s recommendations, and set up a phone line for impacted people.
The letters sent to victims describe the incident and Dartmouth’s response and include access to a one-year subscription to Experian IdentityWorks, a personal security program that helps to prevent identify theft.
Dartmouth reported the data breach last week to the attorney general’s offices of New Hampshire and Vermont. The incident “involves” 31,742 New Hampshire residents, an attorney for the college reported in the filings for New Hampshire.
The breach impacted 12,701 Vermonters, Amelia Vath, senior advisor to the Vermont Attorney General, said Monday.
Dartmouth College filed similar reports in other states including Maine, California and Texas.
The only other data breach Dartmouth College has reported to the New Hampshire attorney general since 2006 was in 2012 when a laptop including personal information for four people was stolen, according to an online database.

The New Mexico Supreme Court issued an order Dec. 2, 2025 that denies a request to repeal Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s line-item vetoes on the bill lawmakers passed. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)The New Mexico Supreme Court on Tuesday issued an order declining to repeal several line-item vetoes Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham struck from legislation lawmakers approved during a recent special legislative session.
Duke Rodriguez, a prominent statewide cannabis executive and possible Republican gubernatorial candidate, filed a lawsuit in mid-October asking the Supreme Court to disallow the governor from striking certain language from a spending bill the Legislature approved in October to counteract anticipated effects from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” President Donald Trump signed in July.
The Legislature approved $162 million in state funding to counteract federal cuts to Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and health insurance tax credits. When lawmakers sent that bill to the governor for her signature, she signed it except for what she described as “minor” but necessary changes to counteract “provisions that unduly constrain the Executive Department’s ability to assist New Mexicans.”
NM cannabis exec asks NM Supreme Court to overturn Gov’s recent line-item vetoes

The bill awarded $12 million to the state Health Care Authority “to maintain the minimum federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefit for elders and people with disabilities.” But the governor struck the words “minimum federal.”  
She also struck language regarding approximately $6 million aimed at replenishing funding local public broadcasters lost when Congress cut funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. She removed requirements that the unexpended funding to the state finance and Indian Affairs departments be returned to the general fund, and she removed language requiring the funding to be spent within the next two fiscal years. 
Rodriguez’s lawsuit, filed with the help of attorney and former lawmaker Jacob Candelaria, argued that each of those vetoes “distorts legislative intent and is therefore an unconstitutional attempt by the Executive to substitute her policy-making judgment for that of the people’s elected representatives.”
That’s a wrap: Special session ends with funding for health care, food assistance and more

The governor’s office responded in court in early November that the lawsuit was meritless, arguing that Rodriguez lacked standing to bring the lawsuit and also that the governor’s vetoes sought only to make it easier for her and the agencies she oversees to implement the Legislature’s intent. 
“At the end of the day, the funds will still be spent on the exact programs the Legislature wanted to fund; the Governor merely struck language that could cause the funds to be spent in an inefficient manner,” Holly Agajanian, chief general counsel for the governor, wrote. 
The Supreme Court, in a brief order issued Tuesday, did not specify why it ruled against Rodriguez, simply stating that the Court was denying Rodriguez’s request after having  “considered the petition and being sufficiently advised.” 
Rodriguez, in a statement Tuesday to Source New Mexico, said he respects the Court’s decision but wishes the Court had issued a “full opinion,” rather than an unexplained order, to address issues he deems critical, including who has standing to challenge executive orders and the “true scope of a sitting governor’s veto authority.”
“Without clearer legal guidance, it is evident that a sitting governor may exert significant influence over — and potentially reshape — the actions of future Legislatures,” he said in an email. “That reality raises the stakes for New Mexico.”
The continued ambiguity, he said, means the “next election will matter even more than many realize. This may be the final push I needed to officially enter this race.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Sine-Die-Dems-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 18:58:09.915808

Relatives still traveled home. Dozens still set up grills and canopies at games. Mississippi Today produced a collection of stories of homecoming events in the Delta, where traditions have evolved over time.
GREENWOOD — A foldable chair is a staple during homecoming season in the Mississippi Delta. It’s your front-row seat for all the homecoming parade offers: music, spectacle and pageantry.
Parade participants rent luxury cars and refashion the tailgates into chariots for rugrat royalty. Students as young as 8 wear crowns and royal get-ups to sit on the hood of a car in a sash.
The float with the Greenwood High School homecoming court is a glorious spectacle. Scarlet capes flutter behind the school’s newly crowned homecoming king Melton Adams and queen Kiyah Davis. Melton boasts a coat encrusted with opalescent jewels, and Kiyah dons a flowing gown with a hoop skirt underneath. Greenwood High School’s prince and princess share a Victorian sofa on a ledge lower. Two oversized strings of pearls trail each side of the float.

The homecoming court along with the less ornate floats and trucks pave the way for the main attraction: Greenwood’s music man and his teen marching band.
Less than 30 minutes before the Greenwood High School band was set to join the parade line, band director Olander Emmons was listening to an upset student who had left his instrument at home and couldn’t participate in the parade. Emmons directed the forlorn teen to the band room. The 17-year-old walked away to get a spare instrument.
Tired of singing the blues
Emmons, like many of his students, joined Greenwood’s band in sixth grade. He played the saxophone, but his first instruments were the drums and then the piano. He learned to play both at church.
Emmons was working as a staffer at the local unemployment office when he ran into his high school band director while grocery shopping at Walmart. She remembered his skill as a music reader. He was already working as an independent musician, playing receptions and churches around the Delta when she scouted him for the band director job. He saw it as an opportunity to develop as an artist and mentor a new generation at his high school alma mater.

He knows how to play most of the instruments in the band, particularly the brass ones. His goal coming into the role three years ago was to write new songs for the band to perform. 
“I wanted the fans to wait in the stands to hear the band,” Emmons said. “And not go to the concession stand.”
A longtime gospel fan, he began listening to more blues music despite his religious upbringing. He felt inspired to incorporate more music from the region into the band’s setlist. Emmons has also tried to develop a “show band” for Greenwood High, incorporating choreography from Lovely Anderson, the dance team coach. 
Emmons said his band has grown from 60 to 125 members since he took over.

He holds open auditions for the middle and high schools each year, pairing students with instruments. Some instruments like the bassoon require students with longer fingers, while others, such as a trombone, require students with longer arms. He pairs students with instruments for reasons both personal and biological.
Channeling pain through the music
Greenwood High has a poverty rate of almost 82%, according to state data from the 2023-24 school year. Gun violence claims the lives of a disproportionate number of teenagers in the region, a statistic that comes up in conversations with students about transportation after practice as well as in class. Sometimes Emmons’ students share stories from their neighborhoods, and those experiences inspire their own compositions, including recent performances at jamborees across the region.
“Music allows them to be able to vent,” Emmons said.“I hear a lot of kids that go through it. They try to put all the pain into the instruments they play.” 
During the homecoming parade, a hot October sun beat down on the streets of Greenwood as music filled the humid air. Dancers in pink outfits and teenagers in gowns and capes crisscrossed Cotton Street. Teachers and parents walked across cracked roads to their ride to the game.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/14140429/3X0A1749.jpg,,,2025-12-02 18:58:09.915808

Mike Hoyt, a Hartford selectboard member, will fill a vacant House seat representing Barnard, Bridgewater and Pomfret, as well as part of Hartford. 
Gov. Phil Scott announced the appointment Tuesday. Hoyt replaces Heather Surprenant, a Barnard Democrat who stepped down in September, according to a press release from Scott’s office. 
In an interview on Tuesday, Hoyt, who lives in West Hartford, said he was excited to build on his prior experience working in state government as well as his time on the Hartford selectboard. He hopes that background will ease his learning curve in the new role.  
“I’ve worked in state government. I’ve enjoyed my time in state government,” he said, adding that his parents also worked for the state. “It’s part of who I am.”
Hoyt’s mother, the late Kathy Hoyt, was a top adviser to former Govs. Madeleine Kunin and Howard Dean.
As an attorney, Hoyt worked for the Vermont Legislature, staffing a range of committees across six years, and later for the Vermont Department of Labor. He now works at Dartmouth College. 
Asked about his legislative priorities, Hoyt named affordability and housing. People travel from as far away as St. Johnsbury to work at the Upper Valley’s largest employers, the college and its hospital, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, he said. While on the selectboard, he said he’s tried to make a dent in those issues by rezoning and keeping municipal budgets in check. 
Hoyt’s appointment is effective immediately.

(Eric Cole/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)Conservation groups are gearing up to take the federal government to court to preserve the protected status of gray wolves across the country.
The Center for Biological Diversity in a Tuesday letter, informed the U.S. Wildlife Service that it intends to file a lawsuit alleging the agency violated the Endangered Species Act by not preparing a national gray wolf recovery plan.
The letter, addressed to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and USFWS Director Brian Nesvik, says that the agency is “attempting to skirt its duty” to develop a nationwide recovery plan, and unlawfully stated that wolves would not benefit from a recovery plan.
“FWS has made numerous premature efforts to reduce or remove federal protections for wolves under the ESA, which the courts have nearly universally rejected,” wrote Collette Adkins, senior attorney for Center for Biological Diversity. “The only successful delisting effort was in the Northern Rocky Mountains, where Congress (through a rider to an appropriations bill) directed FWS to remove wolf protections. Since then, the Center and its allies have submitted petitions to relist wolves in the northern Rockies and across the West, which FWS denied. In August 2025, the U.S. District Court for Montana ruled that FWS unlawfully denied the petitions and remanded to FWS for new analysis.”
In mid-November, USFWS announced it would not release a National Wolf Recovery Plan, despite previously announcing a plan was in the works last year. The agency said the species doesn’t need federal protection.
The move comes as wolves are in the crosshairs of members of Congress who have proposed multiple bills to delist the species from the Endangered Species Act nationwide.
In the United States, wolves are managed in three different groups.
In the Northern Rockies — Montana, Idaho, Wyoming and parts of Washington and Oregon — wolves were removed from the endangered species list and are managed by their respective state wildlife agencies, which allow hunting.
A population of wolves in Minnesota are listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, while wolves in the remaining 44 U.S. states are listed as endangered species.
The letter from the Center for Biological Diversity says that the “piecemeal” recovery efforts have prevents a nation-wide recovery of the species.
“Reliance on such an outdated and geographically restricted plan prevents FWS from facilitating nationwide wolf recovery, including in places such as the West Coast, Southern Rocky Mountains, and the Northeast,” the letter states. “For these reasons, the failure to develop a nationwide wolf recovery plan violates the agency’s mandatory duty under Section 4(f) of the ESA.”
Adkins said the Center will pursue litigation in U.S. District Court if the Fish and Wildlife Service does not make any changes to its current stance on wolf recovery.
In the most recent federal litigation, which saw a federal judge in Missoula vacate the government’s determination that gray wolves in the Western U.S. don’t need increased protections under the Endangered Species Act back in August, was brought by several coalitions of conservation groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/usfws-gray-wolf-snow-large-1024x768-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 18:58:09.915808

The college is one of Colorado's Hispanic-serving institutions. (Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)All of Colorado’s Democrats in Congress wrote Tuesday to the U.S. Department of Education opposing its move to end grant funding programs for minority-serving institutions. 
The department in September announced that it would end federal grants designated for MSIs, schools that are federally designated for serving a high concentration of minority and low-income students. Colorado has 15 MSIs, 14 of which are Hispanic-serving institutions and one of which is a Native American-serving institution, according to the letter.
“These grant programs help provide programming and support specifically for students of color and lower-income students,” the Democrats wrote. “Ending these programs will have widespread detrimental effects on students from all states and backgrounds.”

U.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper and U.S. Reps. Diana DeGette of Denver, Joe Neguse of Lafayette, Jason Crow of Aurora and Brittany Pettersen of Lakewood wrote the letter U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon. 
Colorado colleges and universities have lost millions because of the cuts, the letter says. The Democrats asked the department to help affected institutions find other opportunities for federal funding to make up for the loss of grant funding. They also asked for a written response within 30 days providing more information on where grant funding will be reallocated to ensure it continues to support students. 
“We have heard strong concerns from Colorado colleges and universities that have received termination notices from the Department,” the letter says. “The loss of millions of dollars will mean fewer opportunities for students and will only cause harm to the communities these institutions serve.”
In a press release announcing the funding cuts, McMahon said grant programs specifically for MSIs “discriminate by restricting eligibility to institutions that meet government-mandated racial quotas.” The release said about $350 million in discretionary funding will be reallocated to programs that do not include racial quotas.
Seven of the Colorado Community College System’s 13 colleges are designated HSIs, and three of those schools received grant termination notices. Morgan Community College lost $1.6 million in federal grant funding, Lamar Community College lost $3 million, and Pueblo Community College lost just under $600,000, according to CCCS spokesperson Fiona Lytle. CCCS also has two other schools that were approaching HSI eligibility and were preparing to apply for federal funding. 
Those grants supported first-generation and low-income college students, staff positions that helped students and prospective future students, English as a second language students, orientation programs, and professional development for staff and faculty, among other programs and initiatives at the three affected community colleges.
A lawsuit filed in Tennessee in June challenged the constitutionality of HSIs and related grant programs, arguing they discriminate on the basis of ethnicity.

This week marks the beginning of the Legislature's work on the state’s next two-year budget. 
The post How will lawmakers spend Wyoming’s tax dollars? The budgeting process is underway. appeared first on WyoFile .","This week marks the beginning of the Wyoming Legislature’s annual budget hearings. During the four-week-long process, the Joint Appropriations Committee is meeting in Cheyenne to hear agency requests and to draft a budget bill ahead of the 2026 session. 
In even-numbered years, lawmakers are responsible for crafting and passing the state’s upcoming two-year spending plan, also known as a biennium budget. It is the one thing lawmakers are constitutionally obligated to complete during a budget session. 
While the Legislature ultimately holds the purse strings, it’s the governor who kicks off the process with budget recommendations. 
In November, Gov. Mark Gordon proposed a $11.1 billion budget that would boost state worker pay, bolster wildfire-fighting capacity, renovate the veterans home in Buffalo and put $250 million into permanent savings, among other priorities. 
“Our job, the job of government, is to provide the essentials that communities, families and citizens cannot provide on their own and be accountable and accessible,” Gordon told the committee Monday in his opening remarks. 
The hearings largely involve agencies presenting what’s called a standard budget, which includes no more than the amount needed to allow that office to provide the same level of services in the next budget cycle as it has in the current one. If an agency seeks to diverge from that spending level, such as for new equipment or a special project, it must develop and present an “exception request” to lawmakers. 
Since the last budget session, a new group of Republicans has come into power. In 2024, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus won control of the lower chamber and now holds all but one seat on the House side of the Appropriations Committee. 
While the caucus has pledged to cut the budget, it remains to be seen where and how lawmakers aim to shrink spending. That could become clearer through the committee’s budget work or as lawmakers revise the bill during the session. However, they took extra steps this legislative off-season to scrutinize the Department of Health’s budget by forming a subcommittee. The agency has the largest budget of any state department. 
Alongside agency requests, the committee also relies on revenue forecasts to draft a budget bill. 
In October, a report indicated that Wyoming’s investment portfolio hit a record $1.86 billion in earnings, surpassing revenues from the mineral industry. Meanwhile, other prominent revenue sources fell short, including sales and use taxes and state royalties. 
State forecasters, known as the Consensus Revenue Estimating Group, will present lawmakers with an updated report when the Appropriations Committee gathers in January.
 
The committee will meet through next week, as well as the first two full weeks in January. No formal action will be taken on the budget until the final week of hearings. 
At that point, in a process known as working the bill, the committee goes unit by unit through each agency’s budget with lawmakers voting on motions to approve, deny or adjust each funding request. Vote by vote, those decisions form the budget bill, which is then prepared by the Legislative Service Office staff. 
Budget hearings are open to the public and can also be viewed remotely via the Legislature’s YouTube page. Meeting agendas are available on the Legislature’s website. 
The full Legislature convenes Feb. 9 in Cheyenne.

Larry Rhoden’s plan to keep state funding flat for Medicaid providers, state employees and schools could hurt the same areas Rhoden said he’s helped “prioritize” in recent years, advocates say.
Rhoden announced at his budget address on Tuesday at the Capitol that he wants to keep state support for the “big three” flat this year, due to “pretty flat” sales tax revenues. The last 0% increase proposed by a governor for the big three was by Gov. Kristi Noem for the 2019 budget, according to the state Bureau of Finance and Management.
Governor proposes ‘limited budget’ for SD that avoids big cuts but keeps school funding flat

School districts and health care providers across the state say they’re treading water after years of high inflation, despite relatively high funding increases attributable to an influx in federal pandemic aid and higher sales tax revenue coming out of the pandemic. Lawmakers approved a 1.25% increase for the big three last year, which was below inflation.
Rapid City Democratic Rep. Nicole Uhre-Balk said inflation will eat away at flat funding if legislators approve Rhoden’s plan.
“Not increasing is a cut,” she said.
Rapid City Republican Rep. Mike Derby, chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said projections and revenues could change after the New Year, which could allow for an increase in state support. When Noem last recommended a 0% increase in state aid to education, lawmakers bumped it up to a 1% increase that year.
“We’ll see how the next four months’ revenues come in,” Derby said.
Teacher pay: ‘My fear is that 0% is going to move us backwards’
But Rep. Mellissa Heermann, R-Brookings, worries efforts to “drag ourselves up” in teacher pay rankings will be erased without more state support to education. South Dakota moved up the national ranks from 50th in teacher pay in 2021 to 46th this year.

“It’s been difficult for us to even maintain the gains we’ve had,” said Heermann, who served on the Brookings School Board for six years. “All other states around us are also increasing their teacher pay, so my fear is that 0% is going to move us backwards.”
That could lead to school districts cutting other programs or positions, which could impact student success, said South Dakota Education Association Director of Government Relations and Communications Sandra Waltman.
“Up until about last year, schools were doing OK keeping up with inflation. They weren’t getting ahead,” Waltman said. “But when you start to receive funding that’s less than inflationary, that’s when you start to fall behind and see school districts cut positions and budgets.”
Heermann suggested splitting the big three up to give a targeted increase in state aid to education. Lawmakers traditionally group funding increases for Medicaid providers, education and state employees together. 
Rhoden cautioned against using one-time funding, such as money from the state’s reserve funds, to boost big three funding. 
Derby echoed Rhoden, calling any ideas to use one-time funding for ongoing expenses a “recipe for disaster.”
The stagnant state aid proposal comes at the same time enrollment in public schools is down, due to low birth rates and increases in alternative instruction such as homeschooling and private schools, Rhoden said. Alternative instruction enrollment has increased 216% since 2015.
Medicaid: Lower reimbursement rates create ‘disruption’ in health care
Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, advocated for significant increases in Medicaid reimbursements for health care providers in recent years. The gains helped support a core obligation of state government and ensure health care providers were adequately reimbursed for their services, he said, but he doesn’t “see an option” to offer more than a flat rate this year with a lean budget overall.

“We’ve been working really hard to get them dollars, so not getting them an increase is concerning,” Karr said. “We don’t want anybody to get too far behind because it creates so much disruption in hiring people and providing the services needed, whether education or Medicaid providers.”
One year at 0% is manageable, Karr added, but he wants to see a return to increases that correlate with inflationary pressures to avoid “digging huge holes” for Medicaid providers.
Tim Rave, CEO of the South Dakota Association of Healthcare Organizations, said he is grateful there aren’t any cuts to state Medicaid reimbursement rates, saying cuts would risk health care access to South Dakotans.
“In light of increased inflationary costs,” Rave said, “especially in our case for hospitals and supplies where you’re looking at 10% or 12% inflationary increases, this certainly doesn’t help.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EM8A3851-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 18:58:09.915808

The Trump administration has taken Vermont’s secretary of state to court, asking a federal judge to force the state to turn over information on registered voters. 
Filed on Monday in Vermont’s U.S. District Court, the lawsuit argues Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas violated federal election law when she refused to share registered voters’ addresses, drivers license numbers and the last four digits of their social security numbers, among other information. 
Vermont officials have yet to respond to the suit in court.

Back in August, Copeland Hanzas announced she wouldn’t comply with the Trump administration’s request, arguing Vermont law “specifically prohibits” the state and municipal governments from sharing voters’ personal details with the federal government for certain uses. That includes, per the law, handing over voters’ information so federal agencies can compare it to “personally identifying information contained in other federal or state databases.”
At that time, a number of other states had received similar requests from the Trump administration for voter information. Some states shared the information, while others, including Maine, declined the request. The federal government has since sued some of those states that declined the demand.
In the lawsuit, attorneys in the voting section of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division suggested their inquiry is meant to ensure Vermont’s registered voter list is accurate. The federal attorneys requested that a judge order Copeland Hanzas to comply with the request to turn over voter information. 
A spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s Office said on Tuesday that they weren’t familiar with the details of the lawsuit and declined to comment. 
“We have not yet been served with this lawsuit but we look forward to defending Secretary Copeland Hanzas in this case,” Amelia Vath, a spokesperson for the Vermont Attorney General’s Office, which represents Copeland Hanzas in the case, said in a statement.

As you can imagine, at the Department of War we got a lot of things to do, so … I moved on to my next meeting,” Hegseth told reporters. The secretary said he learned a “couple of hours later” that Adm. Frank M. “Mitch” Bradley “made the correct decision to ultimately sink the boat and eliminate the threat.”When pressed by the reporter if he saw any survivors after the initial strike, Hegseth said “I did not personally see survivors … the thing was on fire.”“This is called the fog of war. This is what you in the press don't understand,” he replied.Hegseth said he didn’t know the exact amount of time between the first and second strikes. He declined to answer follow-up questions.Bipartisan lawmakers on the Senate and House Armed Services committees announced probes over the weekend into the follow-on strike that killed the survivors. Numerous military law experts argue killing survivors of a shipwreck is in clear violation of the Pentagon’s laws of war.Hegseth authorized strikeHegseth initially called The Washington Post investigative report “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory,” in a post on social media Friday.On Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during the daily briefing that Hegseth had “authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes.”“Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated,” Leavitt said at the briefing.On social media Monday night, Hegseth wrote: “Admiral Mitch Bradley is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made — on the September 2 mission and all others since.”A New York Times article Monday, citing five U.S. officials who spoke separately on the condition of anonymity, reported that Hegseth gave an initial written order for an operation to kill the alleged drug smugglers on the boat and destroy the entire vessel. The officials said Hegseth did not address additional steps if the first missile did not accomplish both goals, and that he did not give Bradley additional orders in response to video surveillance of the boat, according to the Times, which wrote that Bradley ordered “several” follow-on shots.The strike in question was the first of nearly two dozen U.S. attacks on boats in the Caribbean Sea, which the administration alleges are smuggling narcotics. The operations, over several months, have killed 83 individuals, according to a CNN timeline.‘I rely on Pete’Trump defended Hegseth at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting, saying “Pete’s done an amazing job.”Regarding the attack, Trump downplayed the importance of a follow-on strike.“I still haven't gotten a lot of information, because I rely on Pete, but to me, it was an attack. It wasn't one strike, two strikes, three strikes,” he said.“Pete didn't know about a second attack having to do with two people. And I guess Pete would have to speak to it. I can say this, I want those boats taken out, and if we have to, we'll attack on land also, just like we attack on sea,” Trump said.Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday that he “wouldn’t have wanted that,” referring to the killing of two men clinging to the wreckage. “Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,” Trump continued.Trump posted Sept. 2 on his Truth Social platform a 29-second edited video of the attack.On Sept. 3, Fox News’ “Fox & Friends” played the video from Trump’s post on repeat while interviewing Hegseth, who told the hosts that 11 alleged “narco-terrorists” were killed in the attack.“I watched it live. We knew exactly what they were doing and we knew exactly who they represented,” Hegseth said on the network’s talk show, which he hosted on weekends prior to being appointed and confirmed as secretary of Defense.The Intercept first reported on Sept. 10 that survivors of the initial Sept. 2 strike were killed in follow-up blasts.Congressional inquiriesLawmakers from both sides of the aisle are now inquiring to learn if what happened on Sept. 2 amounts to a war crime. U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., issued a statement Tuesday, criticizing Hegseth and calling on Trump to fire him if he violated the laws of war.“At the Pentagon, the buck stops with the Secretary of Defense, period,” Slotkin said.The first-term Democrat and former CIA official recently participated in a video, now targeted by a Pentagon investigation, reminding service members that they have a right to refuse “illegal orders.”  “True leaders own the calls they make and take responsibility for their actions. Secretary Hegseth should release the full video of the strike and lay out publicly what happened, without throwing the uniformed military under the bus,” Slotkin said.Senate Majority Leader John Thune defended the administration Tuesday when asked by reporters about the Sept. 2 event and Hegseth’s other controversies, including discussing real-time bombing of targets in Yemen in March on the publicly available app Signal.“I think the Trump administration and the peace-through-strength policies that they are employing around the world are making our country safer, and so Secretary Hegseth is a part of that,” the South Dakota Republican said.",,,,2025-12-02 18:58:09.915808

The poll, conducted by Lansing-based Mitchell Research and sponsored by capitol news outlet Michigan Information & Research Service, Inc., or MIRS, also shows that former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers of White Lake has solid footing in hypothetical matchups against his Democratic rivals in the race for Michigan’s open U.S. Senate seat. Only Democratic U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham comes close enough to making the contest competitive, the Mitchell Research poll shows.
The survey tapped 616 November general election voters, 261 likely Democratic primary voters and 255 likely Republican primary voters between Nov. 18 and Nov. 25. About a third of the responses were collected online.
The general election questionnaire had a margin of error of 3.7%, but the primary voter section had a margin of error upward toward 6%. Still, Mitchell Research said it had a 95% level of confidence in its data.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
U.S. Senate race polling shows opportunity for Rogers, Stevens
Among likely general election voters surveyed, the poll shows Rogers as potentially doing well against each of his Democratic rivals in the race.
Rogers netted 41% of interest from those surveyed against progressive candidate Abdul El-Sayed, who ran for governor in 2018, who polled at 38% At least 22% said they weren’t sure who they were voting for in that matchup.
State Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak was in the same position as El-Sayed, polling just 38% in a hypothetical matchup with Rogers among those surveyed. Of note, Rogers in that matchup polled higher at 44% with 19% saying they weren’t sure yet on who they’d vote for in that scenario.
Stevens comes the closest to making the matchup competitive in the Mitchell Research poll. The congresswoman was polling at 40% among those surveyed to Rogers’ 42%, with 18% saying they were still undecided if that matchup was on the November ballot.
Rogers spokesperson Alyssa Brouillet, in a statement, said that while the Republican’s “socialist opponents battle it out in their bloody primary, Mike Rogers is winning.”
“Michiganders are sick and tired of Democrats in this state killing our jobs, failing our schools, turning a blind eye to violent crime, and trying to shoot our taxes through the roof – and the polls reflect it,” Brouillet said. “Mike Rogers will right the ship and get Michigan working again.”
Joetta Appiah, spokesperson for the Stevens campaign, viewed the data as a win.
“Once again, polling shows Haley Stevens is leading the primary and is the strongest Democratic candidate to beat Mike Rogers,” Appiah said in a statement. “Haley’s focus on lowering costs and strengthening Michigan’s manufacturing economy is how she’s building the coalition to win the primary and carry that momentum into the general election to keep Mike Rogers out of the Senate.”
For El-Sayed’s campaign, the poll shows them as one of only two candidates within the margin of error to beat Rogers.
“Even then, we learned in 2024 what happens when Democrats double down on candidates who defend Israel’s genocide in a state like Michigan: it alienates communities we need to build a winning coalition,” Roxie Richner, El-Sayed’s campaign spokesperson, told Michigan Advance. “Abdul is a formidable general election candidate because he energizes voters where his opponents will struggle to even turn them out. We’re continuing to build a movement of Michiganders who want money out of politics, money in their pockets, and Medicare for All — and we look forward to winning in both August and November.”

Hannah Lindow, spokesperson for McMorrow’s campaign, said the poll confirms what the campaign already says it knows about the race.
“Mallory has the momentum in this race,” Lindow said. “While she continues to close the gap and win with voters who know all three candidates, others in this race have lost ground or remained stagnant.”
Gubernatorial race shows Benson, James in pole positions going into 2026
James and Benson were the ones to top the likely nominee list in the survey.
The Republican with arguably the most name recognition in the race, James, was polling well at 48%, well ahead of his competitors in the race. The survey showed that former Attorney General Mike Cox took 11% of interest from likely primary voters. Meanwhile, 5% of likely Republican primary voters surveyed said they would be voting for former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard, 2% said they would be supporting state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt of Porter Township, and 1% were likely to cast a ballot for former pastor Ralph Rebandt, who previously ran for governor in 2022. At least 33% of likely voters said they were still undecided.
Benson was in the same position on the Democratic side of the race as James, polling among likely primary voters at 48%. Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist was polling at 12% in the survey and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson was polling at 5%
In a race between James and Benson, the general election cohort survey showed the Republican candidate at 37%, the Democratic candidate at 31%, and independent candidate and outgoing Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan at 18%.

Benson, however, leads among those same likely general election voters in a matchup against Cox (the Democratic candidate polled at 33% to the GOP candidate’s 32%) and against Nesbitt (Benson netted interest at 32% of those surveyed to the senator’s 27%) In both scenarios, Duggan still polled third in terms of interest, but slightly higher in the hypothetical matchup between Benson and Nesbitt.
“John James, who lost two US Senate races before being elected and re-elected to Congress in 2022/24, and Mike Cox who lost a race for governor in 2010, are now the leading GOP candidates for governor next year,” said Steve Mitchell,  president of Mitchell Research & Communications. “However, both Aric Nesbitt and Tom Leonard are raising money and intend to be very competitive. It’s too early to count out anyone, although James is clearly in the driver’s seat.”
Hannah Osantowske, spokesperson for James’ campaign, said the poll shows that the congressman is the Republican leader who primary voters are beginning to rally around as their pick for governor.
“Michigan families are rejecting corrupt, career politicians and are ready to put a combat veteran Apache pilot and businessman who’s never left a mission unfinished in the governor’s office,” Osantowske said. “With duty and direction, John will deliver reliable energy, safe communities, affordable homes, good-paying jobs, and skills training from middle school to mid-career so every Michigander can thrive.

Although the emphasis for voters surveyed in the poll was on Benson and James, Duggan was shown to be getting around 20% of interest from likely voters in each of the three hypothetical matchups.
Duggan appeared to be doing better with Democrats than Republicans, which continues to be an interesting plot point in the race given the way he burned Democrats to run as a nonpartisan candidate and continues to get funding support from Republican donors.
If he had announced his candidacy as a Democrat, Mitchell Research shows that he does better with Democrats (at 15%) than Republicans (11%) against someone like Cox, and 6% better in both categories against James.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1135-1024x655.jpg,,,2025-12-02 18:58:09.915808

Heating assistance is “an essential lifeline for more than 20,000 Vermont households every year,” said U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. on Tuesday. “Being able to heat your home is a matter of life and death.”

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has released nearly $21 million in long-awaited federal funding for Vermont’s heating assistance programs, members of the state’s congressional delegation said Tuesday.
“LIHEAP is an essential lifeline for more than 20,000 Vermont households every year,” said U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. in a Tuesday release, describing the federal Low Income Home Energy Fuel Assistance Program. “Being able to heat your home is a matter of life and death.”
U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., agreed in a similar statement on Tuesday, adding, “let’s be clear: these funds never should’ve been stalled in the first place.”
Money from the federal program is dispersed in Vermont through the state’s Seasonal Fuel Assistance and Crisis Fuel Assistance programs. Additional state appropriations allow the programs to reach Vermonters whose incomes are up to 185% and 200% of the federal poverty line, respectively. For a two-person household, that would mean an annual income of about $39,000 or $42,000.

Benefit amount depends on a number of factors including income and utility cost, but the average one-time award for the Seasonal Fuel Assistance program was roughly $1,000 in the last fiscal year.
During the federal government shutdown in October and November, the state dispersed $11 million in fuel assistance on time to individual households and fuel providers. The arrival of federal funds reimburses the state for that expense, and provides support for future benefits over the course of the winter. 
Gov. Phil Scott said last month that he was “confident” that Congress would fulfill its obligation to provide that funding, in contrast with the state’s 15-day stopgap measure for food assistance.
In Tuesday’s release, Welch said funding for LIHEAP had been incorrectly hindered by President Donald Trump’s administration even after the government reopened Nov. 12.
“Not only was it illegal, but heartbreakingly cruel,” Welch said in the statement.
Vermont’s congressional delegation also criticized the Trump administration after mass layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services earlier this year, which included the entire federal staff of LIHEAP.
The White House called for the program’s elimination in a discretionary budget request in May, saying LIHEAP “is unnecessary because States have policies preventing utility disconnection for low-income households.”
Last week, a report from Vermont’s Public Utilities commission recommended that the state Legislature allocate more funding to expanding heat assistance for Vermonters, and prepare for potential losses in federal dollars. In particular, the commission was in favor of expanding the state’s Crisis Fuel Assistance program, which is designed to provide stopgap funding when a household is about to run out of fuel.

,DC,2025-12-02 22:46:16+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"No ‘clear path forward’ in US Senate on spiraling health care costs, with deadline near",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/no-clear-path-forward-us-senate-spiraling-health-care-costs-deadline-near,,"WASHINGTON — Republicans and Democrats in the Senate agree that health care costs are rising too quickly and expect to vote next week on legislation that could help Americans. The only catch is that party leaders hadn’t decided as of Tuesday what to include in the bills. Senators also seemed to accept that neither proposal will garner the bipartisan support needed to advance, leaving the tens of millions of Americans who purchase their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace with complicated decisions to make before open enrollment ends Dec. 15. ACA marketplace plans are expected to increase by 26% on average next year, though a failure by Congress to extend enhanced tax credits would lead monthly payments for subsidized enrollees to increase by 114% on average, according to analysis from the nonpartisan health organization KFF. “I don’t think at this point we have a clear path forward,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said. “I don't think the Democrats have a clear path forward.”Vote on Democratic bill expectedThune guaranteed a small group of Democratic senators a floor vote on a health care proposal of their choosing in exchange for their votes on the spending package that ended the government shutdown. Democrats are widely expected to put forward a bill to extend enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. Those subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year without congressional action. But it isn’t clear if the Democratic bill would extend the credits for one year or a longer period. GOP leaders are trying to rally support around a health care proposal of their own, while acknowledging it won’t get the 60 votes needed to advance under the Senate’s legislative filibuster rules. Thune said Republican senators had a “robust discussion” about health care issues during their closed-door lunch, where Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Bill Cassidy of Louisiana presented some ideas. But no final agreements were reached. Thune, R-S.D., said conversations will continue ahead of the vote next week and likely afterward.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Democrats “have a plan” but declined to say exactly what it entails.“Stay tuned,” Schumer said. “We had a great discussion and I will tell you this: We will be focused like a laser on lowering people’s costs.”Looking for a solutionWest Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said Republican talks on health care have been “vigorous” but that they hadn’t yet “decided on the clear path.” Capito said her “expectation” is that GOP senators will put a bill on the floor next week to bring down the costs of health insurance premiums and health care as quickly as possible, though that hadn’t been finalized.  “I like the idea of people having control of the money as opposed to insurance companies, where they take a 20% profit,” Capito said, echoing comments by President Donald Trump. “I think that has merit.”Capito said senators didn’t discuss during their lunch whether to extend open enrollment past Dec. 15 or possibly reopen it next year, should Congress pass a health care bill that addresses the ACA marketplace tax credits in some way.New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said there is no indication there will be bipartisan agreement to extend the enhanced ACA subsidies or any other health care proposal by next week’s vote, though bipartisan conversations continue.  As for Democrats' plan, Shaheen said it wasn’t “clear” what legislation party leaders will put on the floor for a vote or when they’d make that announcement. ‘Mindful of the timeline’North Dakota Republican Sen. John Hoeven said there is “strong support” among GOP lawmakers for making changes to how the enhanced ACA tax credits work before extending them for any length of time. But he said those negotiations will take more time. “In my opinion, if we have (the vote) next week, we probably won't be at a point where we can get a big bipartisan agreement,” Hoeven said. “It's more likely they'll put something up that fails. We put something up that fails. And we keep working towards, hopefully, something that can work and that is bipartisan.”There is a “good chance,” he said, that will happen in December or January, a timeline that would likely put a solution after open enrollment closes. Hoeven declined to say if a deal would extend open enrollment or include a second window for Americans to select insurance, but said Republicans are aware of the deadlines. “We're very mindful of the timeline,” Hoeven said. “So all the things we're talking about recognize that it needs to be able to take effect next year or this year.”",,,,2025-12-02 17:59:23.467202

Larry Rhoden proposed a $7.44 billion state government budget Tuesday that would avoid big cuts but also hold South Dakota’s funding for schools, Medicaid providers and state employees flat next year. “This limited budget might seem like a challenge, but as I often say, I encourage you all to view that […]","South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden presents his 2025 budget address to lawmakers at the Capitol in Pierre on Dec. 2, 2025. (Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden proposed a $7.44 billion state government budget Tuesday that would avoid big cuts but also hold South Dakota’s funding for schools, Medicaid providers and state employees flat next year.
“This limited budget might seem like a challenge, but as I often say, I encourage you all to view that as an opportunity,” Rhoden told lawmakers during his annual budget address at the Capitol.
The news comes as state spending on Medicaid — the federal-state health program for poor and disabled people — has overtaken spending on K-12 public education for the first time, Rhoden said. Sales tax revenue was down 0.6% during the fiscal year that ended in June, which was only the third time in 30 years that the state experienced a negative sales tax trend. So far during the current fiscal year, sales tax revenue is up 4.7%.
Rhoden said it all adds up to a tight budget situation.
“I won’t sugarcoat it: Revenues have been very flat — only rising slightly,” he said.


He framed his budget as a return to normality after several years of rapid revenue gains fueled by federal pandemic aid and strong sales tax collections.
Rhoden’s plan for the fiscal year beginning July 1 includes about $2.5 billion in state general funds, with much of the rest coming from federal funding. The total proposed budget would be a 1.6% increase from the budget legislators adopted last winter.
Rhoden said the state’s economy remains strong, with the lowest unemployment rate in the country, high labor-force participation and a competitive tax climate. 
Yet, partly due to uncertainty in the national economy and low crop prices affecting South Dakota’s farm economy, Rhoden wants to reserve 12.5% of the general fund budget — about $315 million — in rainy-day funds, up from the traditional 10%. 
‘Big three’ held flat
One of the major discussion points among legislators could be Rhoden’s lack of a proposed funding increase for the so-called “big three”: schools, state employees and health care providers.
“Because our revenues haven’t grown much, we have to keep them flat this year,” Rhoden said.
That means no across-the-board inflationary increase for teacher salaries, Medicaid reimbursement rates or state worker pay. To soften the blow for state employees, Rhoden said his budget puts $3 million into the state health plan to avoid premium hikes.

On education, Rhoden took a long-term view, saying that since 2019, the state has delivered a 27.9% increase in funding for schools.
“So while these priorities aren’t getting an increase this year, I’m proud of what we’ve done for them over the past several years,” Rhoden said.   
Rhoden also tied flat education funding to declining public school enrollment. Births are down 9% over the past decade in the state, he said, and there’s been a 216% surge since 2015 in “alternative instruction,” including homeschooling, private schools and other forms of non-public education. 
No state cuts for local property tax relief
The governor did not propose using any savings from state government cuts to provide relief for local property taxpayers. Legislators made several proposals to that effect during summer study meetings.
Rhoden reminded lawmakers that the proposed budget last year included $80 million in cuts, and legislators restored $7 million. He suggested it will be challenging for legislators to find cuts this year.
“So, I ask the legislators who are asking for cuts, where should we cut?” he said. “Should we cut health care, education or public safety?”
There will be some room for legislators to maneuver. Rhoden said his budget leaves $14 million unallocated for legislative priorities.
New investments
Rhoden made several new spending proposals, including:

Staffing the new women’s prison under construction in Rapid City, including 133 full-time positions and $13.2 million in new annual expenses.
$10 million in one-time funding for information technology modernization to prevent state system outages like one that struck in August.
A newer Highway Patrol airplane for $5 million.
Reallocating $65 million in unused loan money from a $200 million housing infrastructure fund to an economic development fund, and giving $30 million of that as interest-free loans for airport expansion projects in Sioux Falls and Rapid City.
Increasing funding to South Dakota Public Broadcasting by $296,000 to support transparency and open government initiatives, including livestreaming of legislative proceedings. 

 Lawmakers react

Republican Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, is running for governor in 2026 against Rhoden and other candidates. He wants to cut the budget and reallocate the savings as property tax relief for homeowners. He said the first place he would look is at the governor’s “slush funds,” referring to various funds managed by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development.
Rep. Will Mortenson, R-Fort Pierre, said “Governor Rhoden’s budget was pretty bleak.”
“I think there’s real cause for concern for our state,” Mortenson said, pointing to sales tax revenues and Medicaid costs surpassing the cost of education. 
“It seems like we’ve economically gotten stuck in the mud,” he said.
Democratic Rep. Erik Muckey, of Sioux Falls, who serves on the budget committee, said the state could free up $70 million for the budget by reducing the rainy day fund allocation from 12.5% to 10%.
“We can be fiscally responsible with our budgets while also actually taking care of our people,” Muckey said. 
Legislators will begin debating the budget proposals when they convene in January for their annual lawmaking session.

[…],"The West Virginia Supreme Court has temporarily suspended a ruling that would have allowed students to attend school with a religious exemption to the state’s school vaccination requirements. (West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia Supreme Court has temporarily suspended a ruling from a Raleigh County judge that would have allowed students to attend school with a religious exemption to the state’s school vaccination requirements. 
The court on Tuesday granted a stay of the proceedings in a Raleigh County lawsuit brought by families seeking a religious exemption. Judge Michael Froble’s ruling last week enjoined the state and Raleigh County boards of education from enforcing the school vaccination requirements on those seeking a religious or philosophical exemption.
“Upon consideration and review, the Court is of the opinion to, and does, grant the petitioners’ motion to stay,” the Supreme Court wrote. “Enforcement of the circuit court’s November 26, 2025, ‘Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Granting Permanent Injunction and Declaratory Relief’ and  any further proceedings in circuit court are stayed pending resolution of this petition for a writ of  prohibition.”
The state Department of Education had suspended the compulsory vaccination law Wednesday in response to the judge’s ruling. In response to the stay on Tuesday, the department reversed that suspension. It reinstated a directive to county boards of education not to accept religious exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws. 
“This directive will be in effect until the Supreme Court issues further guidance,” the Department of Education said in a news release. “Our priority is to ensure compliance with W.Va. Code §16-3-4 and safeguard the health and well-being of all students across West Virginia.”
In a text message to West Virginia Watch Tuesday, state school board President Paul Hardesty thanked the Supreme Court.
“Like I said several months ago, this critical issue will be determined in the proper venue by the proper people,” Hardesty wrote. “Today, our highest court in the state has spoken and they will take the issue from here.” 
The Raleigh County legal action, brought by residents Miranda Guzman and Carley Hunter on behalf of their children, is one of a handful of lawsuits filed in the state over West Virginia’s school vaccination law and religious freedom. 
All states require school students to be vaccinated against a series of infectious diseases, including polio, measles and chickenpox. West Virginia has been one of only five in the country that do not allow children to opt out of the vaccine requirements based on a religious or philosophical objection. The state has only allowed medical exemptions. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January requiring the state Department of Health to allow religious exemptions. The order is based on the Equal Protection for Religion Act, a 2023 religious freedom law. Morrisey has not rescinded that order even though the Legislature earlier this year rejected a bill that would have added the exemptions to state law. 
According to the state Department of Health, as of Monday, 659 religious exemptions have been processed for the 2025-2026 school year. 
The state Board of Education earlier this year voted to instruct county boards of education not to accept religious exemptions.
Kanawha County Circuit Judge Rich Lindsay last month dismissed a lawsuit filed against the Kanawha County Board of Education, saying that the governor does not have authority to make laws. 
A Berkeley County judge in October denied issuing an injunction to nine families who wanted their religious exemptions recognized by the school board there, according to reporting by West Virginia MetroNews. Attorneys in that case said they would appeal to the state Supreme Court. 
The school board has filed a notice that it would appeal the Raleigh County case to the Supreme Court. 
In a statement Tuesday, Morrisey Press Secretary Drew Galang said the office is reviewing the court filing. 
“Whether we prevail in the courts or prevail with the Legislature, West Virginia will ultimately join the other 45 states that protect and defend religious liberty and will no longer be such an outlier on vaccine policy,” Galang wrote.

‘I don’t want to come in here with a sledgehammer,’ the prosecutor leading the special court told the judge during one of the hearings.

BURLINGTON — A defendant appeared in court on a Wednesday morning in an oversized crewneck with her hands cuffed in front of her. Judge Martin Maley said she was already looking healthier after spending time in jail since her last court date. 
The defendant’s case, involving theft charges, was one of four scheduled that day in Chittenden County’s new community accountability court. The initiative by Gov. Phil Scott started in October aims to address the backlog of court cases by directing resources to cases involving defendants who have five or more pending cases against them. 
The special court was part of Scott’s “short term action plan” to help address public safety challenges in Burlington. In his October announcement, Scott touted the court’s mission to not only move through cases quickly but also to better connect defendants with social services.

Cases are prosecuted by Zach Weight, who was appointed by Scott, and are heard by Maley, who was named by the chief Superior Court judge. 
On a recent day in court, two employees of Vermont’s Agency of Human Services sat with Hope Love, program manager of Therapeutic Works, a mental health services organization. The three often whispered, then pulled the defense lawyer aside to discuss treatment options for defendants. 
During court proceedings, Maley spoke from the bench about trying to help defendants gain stability before looking for accountability from people who have racked up multiple offenses. In one case, a defendant facing several retail theft charges pleaded guilty to four of the misdemeanors in exchange for 120 days to 18 months to serve. The defendant told the judge the charges came as he has battled substance use disorder and relapsed after being clean for five years.    
Before his sentence was imposed, the man apologized for his actions.

“Appreciate hearing that,” Maley said to him, adding, “Hopefully, you’ll find yourself in a place where you’re clean and sober, and I expect you’ll do well.”
As of Nov. 20, 18 defendants in the court had their cases resolved, according to Chief Superior Judge Thomas Zonay. Because those people had many legal cases against them, the court has resolved 152 cases. Also, 87 defendants had cases in the docket yet to be resolved, Zonay said. 
The court’s pilot period is projected to run through February, according to Tim Lueders-Dumont, executive director of the state Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs.
With about three months left, the case of the defendant who appeared that Wednesday offers a look at how attorneys and the judge are grappling with the court’s mission and resources in the cases they review. VTDigger is not naming the defendants in this story because their cases are not the type of prosecutions the publication would generally cover.
Maley began a court hearing on her case with a question for the defense: “What’s happened since we were here last?”
The defendant has been stabilized in prison, she’s on medication and reading books, said her attorney, Harley Brown. He proposed a sentence that would allow her to be released under the supervision of the Department of Corrections.
Maley said that Brown’s proposed sentence might make Maley “swallow hard and wonder why,” about the light sentence. The new court affords the lawyers and judge “the luxury of spending more time with folks and having these conversations,” Maley said.
Weight said in court that prosecuting the case of the defendant in court on that Wednesday is complicated: She is facing multiple charges for alleged thefts from vehicles. In some of those cases the victims drove in from out of state and Weight can’t even get them on the phone, let alone appear in court, he said.
The defendant has struggled with housing. She’s been trying to get a hotel room, but they’re hard to find, Brown said. 
“I mean, prison is not the answer to homelessness, I get that,” Maley said. But Maley said he was concerned about releasing the defendant into the community without any housing or support, especially when she seems to be getting healthier in jail.
Both parties discussed the possibility of letting the defendant go to Oregon, where she has family she asked to be with. But Maley said he doesn’t like the idea of passing off the case for other states to deal with. 
Weight said that a lot of defendants in the court docket have to leave the county or state to get the services they need. Many have gone to New Hampshire to get into a sober living program, he said. 
Weight said that while the defendant has many cases against her for a range of crimes, he didn’t want to propose a sentence out of line with what other defendants around the state are receiving for similar crimes. 
“I don’t want to come in here with a sledgehammer and punish people exponentially worse because they ended up in front of Your Honor,” Weight said. 
On another day, 14 cases were scheduled to be heard by the court. In many of those cases, the defendant had a warrant out for their arrest and did not appear in court. It’s unusual for a court to review those cases, Maley said, but he wanted to make sure they weren’t forgotten about. 
Not all cases were straightforward. In one, Weight believed that defendant was recently arrested in Florida. Both parties discussed with Maley how it might not be worth it to spend the state resources and money to transport someone back to Vermont if they were only facing minor charges. 
In another case, a man facing two charges of aggravated assault appeared to be heading to trial on at least one charge and the next available trial dates weren’t until the end of January. If a resolution to the cases was reached short of a trial, Maley told the parties, he would get them back in sooner.
When both parties weighed how to resolve the case of the defendant with the theft charges, Weight said, “I have tried to take the approach of being creative in resolving these cases.” 
Both sides weighed the pros and cons of different arrangements that might let her out into the community. However, they wanted to make sure the defendant had stable housing so she could continue to make progress. 
The judge agreed to a request from Weight to set the matter for another hearing.
That would buy everyone some time, the prosecutor told Maley, to “put a plan together so that she’s not released to a tent on the street.”

(USDA photo)A case of highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in a commercial turkey flock of about 18,000 birds in Hamilton County, according to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. 
Iowa has had nine detections of the H5N1 strain of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has impacted more than 184 million commercial and backyard birds since February 2022. 
IDALS reported a case of the bird flu in a Calhoun County turkey flock in October. The October case was the first detection in the state since April.

Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation for Hamilton County following the HPAI detection. The proclamation makes state resources more available as officials work to dispose of birds exposed to the virus and monitor, contain and further detect the bird flu. 
IDALS asked producers to exercise heightened biosecurity around their flocks to help prevent the spread of HPAI, which is usually deadly for exposed poultry. 
Producers who notice sudden deaths in a flock, lethargy, decreased egg production, or birds with swollen heads and difficulty breathing, should contact their veterinarians, according to the agriculture department. 
Turkey, chicken and egg products remain safe to consume during the current HPAI outbreak, IDALS said.

(Photo illustration by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Islanders who received letters from the state that their personal information was compromised in the RIBridges data breach have the next six weeks to file a claim for a share of the $6.3 million class action settlement with Deloitte, the system’s vendor.
An estimated 735,501 Rhode Islanders whose personal information was compromised are considered class members, who can seek a flat reimbursement estimated at $100 per individual without having to provide proof of identity theft. Or, if you can provide documentation of losses tied to the breach, you can file for up to a $5,000 reimbursement. Class members can also make claims for two years of medical data monitoring, regardless of which payout they choose to pursue. 
Eligible Rhode Islanders have started to receive postcards in the mail with instructions on how to file a claim. Claims can also be made at the settlement website, ribridgesdatasettlement.com.
Claims need to be filed by Jan. 14, 2026. 
People who wish to opt out of or object to the class action settlement need to file by Dec. 30, 2025. The settlement is being managed by the Kroll Settlement Administration.
The data breach was made public in December 2024. The cyberattack, for which cybercriminal group Brain Cipher eventually took credit, stole private information from people who used the RIBridges platform, which is used to apply for public benefits such as food stamps as well as health insurance coverage through the state marketplace.
The settlement is the end result of the case Pannozzi v. Deloitte Consulting LLP, which was filed in March in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island and consolidated multiple lawsuits against Deloitte for the global firm’s role in the data breach. As part of the suit, the state-contracted Deloitte has denied any wrongdoing.
The $100 payout, however, is an estimate as the settlement is structured to pay out attorneys’ fees and other court costs before class members can be compensated. The plaintiffs’ legal team can absorb up to one-third of the settlement money, under the agreement’s terms. The seven named plaintiffs in the suit are also allowed $2,500 payouts.
If each of the more than 735,000 class members filed a claim, that would work out to about $8.50 per flat payment, prior to litigation fees or other costs. Accounting for litigation fees and the larger payouts attached to documented losses, the flat rate payouts could drop lower. Conversely, payouts could potentially be more than $100 if fewer people sign up for compensation. 
After the deadline for claims submissions, on Jan. 29, 2026, the settlement is scheduled for a court date in which it’s expected to receive the final OK from a federal judge.

Residents have since filed two lawsuits in a bid to stop the project. (Leah Romero for Source NM)Nearly three months have passed since Doña Ana County officials approved $165 billion in bonds for Project Jupiter, yet the controversial southern New Mexico data center complex’s potential impact on the area’s air quality remains unknown.
For months, critics have protested the billions in government-backed bonds and the plan to tap into one of the state’s most troubled water utilities. Residents and lawmakers in the area are also increasingly voicing concerns that the plans to fuel the project with natural gas generating stations will have serious effects on the region’s air quality.
Plans for Project Jupiter call for “microgrids” to power it. Microgrids are developments that can run solely on their own power sources without needing to connect to an existing grid, such as PNM or El Paso Electric. Plans for Project Jupiter call for constructing natural gas generating stations for its microgrid, prompting concern over whether this project can comply with the state’s Energy Transition Act, which requires utilities to meet renewable energy benchmarks and use fully renewable sources by 2045.
Recently, Acoma, LLC, a company affiliated with BorderPlex Digital Assets, which represented Project Jupiter at public meetings, published notices that it intended to apply for two air quality permits with the New Mexico Environment Department. 
Each notice corresponds to a different “microgrid” natural gas generating station planned for the project. Combined, the notices say the gas plants will emit more than 14 million tons of greenhouse gases per year.
By comparison, Albuquerque and Las Cruces, the state’s two largest cities, emit a combined 6.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gases per year, according to both cities’ climate action plans. The defunct San Juan Generating Station near Farmington emitted 12 to 13 million metric tons per year and PNM’s entire system emits about 1.8 million metric tons, according to Stacy Tellinghuisen, deputy director of policy development for clean energy at the Colorado-based nonprofit Western Resource Advocates. Last year, when a Meta subsidiary filed an application to modify the air permit for its Los Lunas data center south of Albuquerque, it said the site’s greenhouse gas emissions would be less than 75,000 tons per year.
It’s not clear whether the plants will emit that much, or whether the figures are typos. BorderPlex Digital Assets and OpenAI, one of the main partners behind the development, did not respond to requests for comment.
“I think this means there is an error in Project Jupiter’s air permit application,” Tellinghuisen wrote in an email to Source NM. “I’d expect the facility, based on what we know about it, to emit 2 to 3 million tons of CO2 equivalents per year and would expect their air permit to allow it to emit up to 3 to 4 million tons/year.”
State law requires companies like Acoma, LLC to file a public notice stating its intent to apply for an air quality permit before actually applying. Acoma’s recent notices say the company planned to submit its application on Nov. 13. A spokesperson for the New Mexico Environment Department said Acoma, LLC had filed applications. He did not provide Source NM with copies of the applications, writing in an email that he was waiting on department legal staff to provide them. It’s unclear if Acoma, LLC applied for permits that would allow its microgrids to emit the combined 14 million tons per year, or if the figures in the application are reduced. 
When the company first filed similar notices for the microgrid gas plants in the Las Cruces Sun-News in October, it listed even larger figures: a combined output of 46.6 million tons per year. The most recent notices represent a significant decrease.
“We have to see the applications first to know how to proceed, but we’re definitely watching it,” Maslyn Locke, New Mexico Environmental Law Center’s senior environmental justice staff attorney, told Source NM. “This whole thing has been so rushed and shrouded in secrecy.”
A coalition of residents, lawmakers and climate advocates in the area share Locke’s concerns over transparency. Critics for months have said that details about the project, which was first announced in February, have been hard to come by. Some have filed lawsuits, alleging that elected county leaders voted on an incomplete application when they voted on the project. A coalition of project critics have organized weekly livestreams dubbed “Jupiter Watch,” in which those who have researched and followed the project closely share their findings with viewers. During the inaugural livestream Monday, Las Cruces-based filmmaker Annie Ersinghaus said the project has “been kept in the dark” and hopes that more community involvement will change that.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jupiter3-1024x683.png,,,2025-12-02 17:59:23.467202

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)The Yellowstone County Commissioners at their Tuesday meeting appointed Stacy Zinn to represent House District 52 in the Montana Legislature.
Zinn, who was elected vice chairwoman of the state Republican Party this summer, will serve the remainder of Rep. Bill Mercer’s term. Mercer resigned his position after his confirmation as a U.S. District Court judge in Montana.
In a statement, Speaker of the House Brandon Ler said Zinn’s background will be an asset in the Legislature.
“Stacy Zinn has spent her career on the front lines defending American communities from cartels, terrorists, and violent drug traffickers,” Ler said. “She understands the challenges facing Billings and all of eastern Montana, from public safety and border security to the impact of fentanyl on our tribal and rural communities. Our caucus is excited to welcome her to the Montana House, and I am confident she will be a strong, independent voice for families and law enforcement in House District 52.”
During Tuesday’s meeting, the commissioners interviewed three candidates recommended by the county Republican Party — Zinn, former three-term state Rep. Rhonda Knudsen, and Jenna McKinney, who has worked for members of Montana’s federal delegation.
Knudsen served as the representative for House District 34 during the 2019, 2021 and 2023 session, but opted to run for the Senate in 2024, losing the primary to newcomer Gregg Hunter.
House District 52, in blue, comprises the north side of Billings.
Zinn spent more than 20 years working for the Drug Enforcement Agency along the souther border, on international deployments and as Montana’s DEA agent in charge starting in 2014. After mandatory retirement from the law enforcement agency due to age, Zinn got involved in the state’s political scene, running in the primary for Montana’s eastern U.S. House District. She finished third in the primary.
This summer, she ran for party chair and was elected vice chairwoman.
In her interview, Zinn told the commissioners she still has “fire in my belly” to serve, and had already filed to run for HD 52 with the state Commissioner on Political Practices.
She said her expertise in law enforcement would be a benefit to lawmakers in Helena.
“I feel I could represent law enforcement side of the House, which I think is missing in Helena,” Zinn said. “I understand probation, parole. I understand CPS (Child Protective Services). I understand the jail situation. I understand Indian country, especially, and the heartaches and stuff that’s taking place there.”
Commissioner Mark Morse asked Zinn about the most pressing issue facing residents of Yellowstone County, and she focused in on “the uptick of criminal element.”
“I think the biggest threat that we have right now is the unknowns moving into our communities,” Zinn said, adding she believes there is an increased presence of cartel members, gang members, and money laundering operations in the region.
In addition, Zinn said that rising property taxes, overcrowded schools and an overcrowded judicial system are also concerns to the county.
“We have a district attorney’s office that is busting at the seams,” she said. “They have stacks of cases that can linger on their desk for three three years plus, this can be anywhere from meth cases on up, and lot of times they get dismissed. So we need to figure out how to give support to the district attorney’s office.”
In Helena, Zinn said she will bring “fresh ideas,” advocate for law enforcement, and work to lower the burden of taxation on residents and cut down on wasted money in the state budget.
“I want to be a team player, but I also will continue putting the voters in our community first,” Zinn said. “And I want to be that partnership with you alland our leaders. I want to be that one (who) is going to communicate because I don’t believe in blindsiding Yellowstone County.”

The nonpartisan Idaho Office of Performance Evaluations, which is commonly referred to as OPE, released the 129-page Idaho Home Learning Academy evaluation report Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol after the release was authorized by the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Legislative Oversight Committee. 
OPE released the evaluation report after multiple Idaho legislators signed a March 5 letter requesting the office study the Idaho Home Learning Academy’s finances, expenditures, policies, contracts and student achievement results.
The Idaho Home Learning Academy, or IHLA for short, is a rapidly growing public virtual charter school authorized by the small, rural Oneida School District. 
There were about 7,600 online students enrolled at Idaho Home Learning Academy during the 2024-25 school year, many of which do not live within the traditional geographic boundaries of the Oneida School District. 
 New report raises questions about how supplemental learning funds are used by some families

As part of Idaho Home Learning Academy’s contract, its education service providers administer supplemental learning funds of $1,700 to $1,800 per student to families enrolled in IHLA that were paid for by Idaho taxpayer dollars, the report found. The money is intended to help pay families for education expenses, and the OPE evaluators found that the largest share of the funds were spent on technology expenses, such as computers, printers and internet access. Other significant sources of supplemental learning fund expenses went for physical education activities and performing arts expenses, the OPE report found.
However, OPE evaluators found that some families used their share of funding for tuition and fees at private schools and programs. Some families also used their funds for noneducational board games, kitchen items like BBQ tongs, cosmetics, a home theater projector screen, video games, Nintendo Switch controllers, a Meta Quest virtual reality headset, movie DVDs, weapons, sights lasers, shooting targets, remote controlled cars, hoverboards, action figures, smartwatches, water park tickets and the cost of registering website domain names, the OPE report found. 
Families with students enrolled at Idaho Home Learning Academy are able to access the funds though both direct ordering programs and reimbursements. The OPE report found that Idaho Home Learning Academy’s three service providers (Braintree, Home Ed and Harmony) spent about $12.5 million providing supplemental learning funds for IHLA families during the 2024-25 school year. Service providers said that some families did not spend any or all of their supplemental learning funds, and the money was retained by the service providers, not returned back to the state or school district, the OPE report found. 
 Idaho governor, superintendent of public instruction respond to OPE report’s findings

Idaho Gov. Brad Little called the report’s findings “troubling” in a letter released with the report Tuesday.
“We also have an obligation to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars,” Little wrote. “The OPE report on IHLA is troubling, especially as it pertains to supplemental learning fund expenses, academic performance, supplemental curriculum and the funding formula that enables virtual programs to receive more funding than brick-and-mortar public schools. The OPE report reveals that statutory safeguards are insufficient, oversight is inconsistent and accountability measures have not kept pace with the fast expansion of the IHLA program.”
The OPE evaluation report findings come at a time when every dollar of state funding in Idaho is being stretched further amid a revenue shortfall. All state agencies outside of the K-12 public school system are implementing 3% mid-year budget holdbacks, and the state budget is projected to end fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2027 in a budget deficit, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Idaho may need to find $600 million to $1 billion for next year’s state budget

Idaho Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield said the report raised concerns for her as well.
“(The OPE report) also raises important questions about whether direct and indirect payments to families are a proper and legal use of funds appropriated for public schools,” Critchfield wrote in a Nov. 26 letter to OPE leadership.

The OPE evaluation report found that limited oversight and accountability create uncertainty about how supplemental learning funds paid for with state taxpayer dollars are used and whether students’ curriculum choices align with state standards and transparency requirements. 
Idaho state laws and administrative rules do not specifically allow or prohibit the use of supplemental learning funds, the OPE report found. That finding was one of several “policy gray areas” that the OPE evaluation report documented. 
Little concluded his letter by saying he is ready to work with the Idaho Legislature, the Idaho State Department of Education and the Idaho State Board of Education to restore meaningful accountability for the use of taxpayer dollars.
“I have carefully reviewed the recommendations provided in this report and strongly encourage the Legislature to address the loopholes in state statute,” Little wrote. 
 Oneida School District superintendent stresses Idaho Home Learning Academy did not break state law

In response to the OPE report, Oneida School District Superintendent Dallan Rupp, who is also a member of the Idaho Home Learning Academy School board, emphasized that the report did not find that IHLA was guilty of any misconduct.
“Importantly, the OPE report did not identify any misconduct at IHLA,” Rupp said during a meeting Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. “This outcome underscores the effectiveness of Oneida School District’s oversight and reflects IHLA’s consistent compliance with Idaho’s laws, statutes, rules, regulations and procedures, as well as its cooperative relationship with the Idaho State Department of Education. We remain fully committed to operating within all established guidelines, just as we have in the past.”

Idaho Sen. James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, said it was beside the point that the school didn’t break any laws.
“I’m extremely concerned,” Ruchti said during Tuesday’s meeting at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. “This is public money – public taxpayer money – and we have an obligation to make sure that it’s spent appropriately and with oversight. And so, yes, it may not have violated any statutory requirements at this point. But what I’m saying is that what I saw in that presentation caused me serious concerns about how IHLA and other online teaching institutions are able to spend public dollars in a way that was not intended.”
 Idaho watchdog report found most online virtual teachers were part-time employees

OPE also found that most Idaho Home Learning Academy teachers were part-time, unlike traditional schools, and the Idaho Home Learning Academy spends much less on salaries and benefits than it receives from the state’s salary apportionment formula. 
The report found IHLA was able to use the savings it realized in state funding provided to pay for staff salaries and health benefits to instead use at IHLA’s discretion or to pay its education service providers. 
The OPE report found that most of IHLA’s teachers are part-time employees and do not provide full-time direct instruction to students. Instead, the report found that Idaho Home Learning Academy’s kindergarten through eighth grade instructional model relied heavily on parent-directed learning and that IHLA teachers typically offered feedback and oversight instead of direct instruction. 
According to the report, IHLA reported $46.3 million in total expenditures from state funds during the 2024-25 school year. While traditional brick-and-mortar public schools’ largest expenditures are for staff salaries and benefits, the report found that only 36% of IHLA’s expenditures went to staff. A larger portion – 45% of IHLA’s total expenditures, or $20.6 million – went to paying education service providers.
The OPE report also found that Idaho Home Learning Academy’s students lagged behind statewide averages for scores on Idaho Standards Achievement, or ISAT, tests. The OPE report found 42% of IHLA students were proficient in English language arts during the 2024-25 school year, compared to the statewide average of 52% of Idaho students. 
The report also found just 25% of IHLA students were proficient in math during the 2024-25 school year, compared to the Idaho statewide average of 43%.
However, the OPE report highlighted that some IHLA families interviewed for the report said they do not believe statewide standardized tests are a good measure of student learning. The report also noted that many Idaho Home Learning Academy families identified themselves as homeschoolers and said they were using IHLA by choice because they were unhappy with the quality of education in traditional brick-and-mortar schools or felt that their child’s educational needs were not being met by more traditional public schools.

Dec. 2, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Supreme Court considered arguments Tuesday in a multi-year fight over whether state officials needed to bargain with a state employees union over an executive order seeking to limit remote work.
Multiple justices questioned what constituted “bargaining” in relation to the November 2023 executive order from Gov. Jim Pillen, which ordered most state employees to return to work in person, beginning Jan. 2, 2024. 
A three-member panel of the Nebraska Commission of Industrial Relations, a state labor court, unanimously upheld the order in July 2024. The commission decided state officials didn’t violate the rights of the Nebraska Association of Public Employees when it refused to negotiate.

The court said the labor contract already “covered” remote work and that the union’s lawsuit was “frivolous” and done in “bad faith.” As a punishment, the commission ordered the union to pay $42,234.63 for state attorneys’ fees.
The union appealed, arguing it was the union’s duty to defend members’ rights. The union also said that while it tried to negotiate limited work standards before a two-year contract took effect July 1, 2023, the state flatly rejected the attempt. 
State employees received “historic” pay increases under that contract, which state officials said was a concession, but a union leader and the union’s attorney said pay raises were separate and not a “quid pro quo” agreement.
What is ‘bargaining’?
Justices Jonathan Papik and John Freudenberg asked whether the union abandoning remote work standards and not pushing the state further was still “bargaining.” 
Attorney Richard Griffin, for the union, said it was not and that the union had not “clearly” or “unmistakably” waived its right to bargain.
“Bargaining involves give and take,” said Griffin. “Bargaining involves counter proposals. Even hard bargaining involves some response, and then the parties look to other provisions of the contract where they can reach compromise. This was not bargained over.”

(Pool photo from Kenneth Ferriera of the Lincoln Journal Star)
The union represents more than 8,000 state employees, or about 45% of state workers. Since the union challenged the order, the commission paused the remote work order for union-covered positions. The current two-year contract, mid-2025 to mid-2027, included no further clarifications on remote work.
Zach Viglianco, the state’s principal deputy solicitor general, said the state’s refusal to consider limited remote work standards was a “bargaining strategy.” He said state officials chose to “surrender” on other matters but “jealously guarded” broad authority over remote work.
Viglianco echoed the commission that the labor contract gave state employers “the right to increase, reduce, change, modify and alter the composition and site of the work force.” Viglianco said that clearly means “where” work occurs, in addition to other broad language for various aspects of work at any time, including shifts, working hours and duties or responsibilities.
“There is no other way to read that unambiguous language,” Viglianco said. “The fact that a party can present an alternative interpretation of language does not render it ambiguous.”
‘Site of the workforce’
Justice Jason Bergevin honed in on that part of the contract and asked why “site of the workforce” didn’t mean remote work. Griffin said it might but doesn’t explain implementation.
Griffin and Justin Hubly, the union’s executive director, said state law still requires negotiations over specifics of and full rights to members for implementation, such as defining “remote work” and “remote location.”
“Why wouldn’t it fully define the party’s rights to say the state can determine the site of work, and that’s the definition — the state has complete discretion?” Papik asked.

Griffin responded that it still doesn’t answer what happens when a worksite is unavailable because of no or little office space. Some exceptions were considered in Pillen’s executive order in such cases, leaving broad authority to state agency heads to implement the order.
The Nebraska Department of Administrative Services did not respond to a Tuesday request from the Nebraska Examiner on the latest status of remote or hybrid work for state employees. 
Hubly said only one in six of union members ever worked remotely during the pandemic, and many had returned to work in person. He estimated that about 1,000 state workers were still remote, some of whom had always been in remote or hybrid positions.
“The idea that nobody is working remotely is just not true, but it is significantly reduced from where it was,” Hubly said.
Pillen’s order also asked for “mechanisms” to measure and confirm productivity for public servants still allowed to work in remote or hybrid settings, which the union sought to clarify.
Order relates to COVID-19 pandemic
Freudenberg asked Viglianco whether Pillen’s order stemmed from the COVID-19 pandemic. Pillen himself said in the executive order that Nebraskans expect that people are most productive in person and that “the COVID-19 pandemic is over.”
“The people of Nebraska expect their elected leaders to restore Nebraska’s public servant workforce to the posture it was in prior to the pandemic,” Pillen wrote in his order.
NE labor court sides with Gov. Pillen’s order calling state employees back to the office 

Viglianco said the pandemic had some influence, such as on the number of workers working from home. However, he said remote work has existed since at least the 1980s. 
A state brief to the Supreme Court argued the union hadn’t complained before regarding remote work, including a May 2021 executive order from then-Gov. Pete Ricketts.
Attorneys’ fees
A separate question before the Supreme Court is whether to uphold the assessment of attorneys’ fees against the union. It was one of the first cases where the party suing in front of the labor court had been awarded attorneys’ fees. The union worried it could “chill” further labor disputes.
The state estimated its attorneys’ fees at $113,296.63 but found the commission’s lower award “reasonable.” State attorneys and the commission alleged the union purposefully tried to delay the case while increasing its fee-paying membership.
“[Deterring] future frivolity is an important role played by awards of attorney fees,” the state wrote in a brief to the Supreme Court justices. “Affirming the award entered here will reinforce the notion that abuse of legal process, like crime, does not pay.”

Griffin told the justices that hundreds of employees had contacted the union and that it was within the union’s free speech rights to seek to increase membership or ask for donations. The union also argued the commission could not assess fees against those filing labor disputes, describing the action as “punitive,” “unprecedented” and beyond the commission’s authority.
Hubly said the union would begin the next round of bargaining in September and that remote work could still make sense for some needed positions, such as human resources, accounting and information technology. However, he said it’s not for all positions, like snowplow drivers.
“We’re really happy that we decided to take this appeal all the way to the Supreme Court,” Hubly said at a noon-hour rally. “Regardless of what happens there today, we’re going to get clarity from the highest court, and that will guide our path at the bargaining table in the future.”
The Supreme Court will issue an opinion on the case soon. Sarpy County District Judge Stefanie Martinez rounds out the current six-member court.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The interim director for South Carolina’s elections agency is slated to become its permanent director following a unanimous vote from the commission Tuesday.
Jenny Wooten, previously the agency’s chief of staff, took over as interim director in September, after the five-member commission voted 3-2 to fire then-director Howard Knapp.
Knapp was arrested in October on charges of embezzlement and misconduct in office. Investigators claimed he used state vehicles for personal travel and a public credit card to pay for fuel on those trips over eight months, according to court documents.
Fired SC elections chief charged with embezzlement, misconduct

Knapp’s former deputy director, Paige Salonich, was arrested the same day on a single charge of wiretapping. Both Knapp and Salonich were released from jail on personal recognizance bonds. That means they pay nothing up front as long as they continue to show up for court hearings.
Commission members have publicly praised Wooten for her transparency with the oversight board, especially when it comes to the agency’s budget. Wooten first started working for the State Election Commission in 2022, overseeing policy and outreach, according to a commission news release.
She will need approval from the Senate to officially become the agency’s director.
“Ensuring the impartiality, accessibility, and integrity of South Carolina’s elections is essential to maintaining public faith in our democracy,” Wooten said in a statement. “I’m grateful to the commission for the trust they have placed in me as our agency strives to uphold that mission.”
Wooten most recently worked in communications for Columbia nonprofit Serve & Connect, which works to form relationships between police and civilians. Before that, she oversaw programs for college savings, tuition repayment and financial literacy for the Treasurer’s Office. She has also worked for the attorney general’s office and as an office assistant for Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer, according to her LinkedIn.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0167-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 17:59:23.467202

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – About 160 members of the Oklahoma National Guard will deploy to secure Washington, D.C.
A send-off ceremony was held Monday at the Armed Forces Reserve Center in Mustang for members of the Oklahoma National Guard’s Task Force Thunder participating in the D.C. Safe and Beautiful mission. The guard will deploy over the coming days.
The mission will last about 90 days.
“Our Guardsmen routinely answer the call to serve and support their community, state and nation,” said Maj. Gen. Thomas H. Mancino, adjutant general for Oklahoma. “As with many state-side support missions, this mission is voluntary, and I am so proud of each and every one of our Guardsmen as they continue to step forward.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt authorized members to participate.
His office said Tuesday that the deployment is funded by the federal government, but did not provide a cost.
Sarah Corley, a Stitt spokeswoman, said the mission is part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing request for support from the states to “protect the federal enclave of D.C.”
Trump in March signed an executive order creating the D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force and assigned it wide-ranging responsibilities, including providing more law enforcement presence in areas such as the National Mall and Memorial Parks, museums, monuments, Lafayette Park and Union Station.
The executive order also indicated it would work to beautify public spaces.
Over 2,000 national guard troops are already in D.C. 
Last month, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration’s decision to deploy the National Guard was illegal. The judge paused the order to give the Trump administration time to appeal the Nov. 20 decision or to remove the guard. The Trump administration has appealed.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth pledged last week to increase the number of troops in Washington D.C. by 500 following the shooting of two on-duty guard members.  
West Virginia National Guard Spc. Sarah Beckstrom died Nov. 27 after a targeted attack blocks from the White House.
Another victim, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe of Martinsburg, West Virginia, remains hospitalized after being shot.
Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, an Afghan refugee, faces a charge of first-degree murder while armed, possession of a firearm and assault with intent to kill. He pleaded not guilty Tuesday during an arrangement hearing.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Planned Parenthood dropped a case challenging the state’s ability to remove its clinics from the list of approved Medicaid providers, ending a seven-year legal saga, advocates confirmed Tuesday.
The decision came after a federal appeals court ruled that Congress could block Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide from receiving Medicaid funds. A separate U.S. Supreme Court ruling earlier this year barred South Carolina’s two Planned Parenthood clinics from getting Medicaid reimbursements.
The South Carolina case began with an executive order from Gov. Henry McMaster in 2018 telling the state’s Medicaid agency to stop reimbursing Planned Parenthood for non-abortion health services, which include birth control, breast cancer screenings, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
Planned Parenthood sued, blocking the order before it took effect.
Planned Parenthood files new challenge to stay on SC’s Medicaid list for non-abortion services

After years of legal back and forth, the U.S. Supreme Court in June decided patients don’t have a right to sue in order to see the doctor of their choice, allowing the state to stop reimbursing Medicaid costs at Planned Parenthood clinics in Columbia and Charleston.
Planned Parenthood tried another tact in August, this time arguing the order unfairly discriminated against the nonprofit. But when the federal appeals court’s September decision barred clinics nationwide from receiving Medicaid funds, attorneys realized they didn’t have a path forward, said lobbyist Vicki Ringer.
“Even if we were successful on a state case, we would still have that federal defunding,” Ringer told the SC Daily Gazette.
The paperwork for the settlement is still being finalized, Ringer said. The notice was filed in federal court Oct. 17.
McMaster declared victory.
“Thanks to Gov. McMaster’s leadership and his victory at the U.S. Supreme Court, South Carolina taxpayers will never again be forced to subsidize abortion providers like Planned Parenthood,” spokesman Brandon Charochak said in a statement.
But Planned Parenthood isn’t giving up entirely. Under the agreement to drop the challenge, the organization could try again later, should federal law change or justices rule differently. However, nothing is in the works for the time being, Ringer said.
Clinic closures
In 2025, 50 Planned Parenthood clinics have closed nationwide, according to a report Planned Parenthood released last month.
They include 20 closures since July 4, according to the nonprofit.
That’s when President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill into law. A provision in that massive package banned Medicaid dollars from going to clinics that offers abortions.
The two locations in South Carolina are not in danger of adding to the tally, Ringer said.
“There has been no talk, no thoughts, no nothing about closing our two health centers,” Ringer said.
Because South Carolina never expanded Medicaid eligibility under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, few of the patients who visited Planned Parenthood — even before the court rulings — used Medicaid.
An estimated 500 of the clinics’ 12,000 total patients in their South Carolina database, or around 4%, used Medicaid, she said.
Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood clinics in SC have stopped, but questions remain

“Certainly, any amount of money has an impact when you’re a nonprofit organization,” Ringer said. But most of the funding for the South Carolina clinics comes from donations and grants, not Medicaid reimbursements, she added.
Of the $35 million spent on South Carolinians’ Medicaid-covered family planning services in 2022-23, Planned Parenthood received $88,464, or 0.2%, according to the latest data from the state’s Medicaid agency.
Planned Parenthood stopped requesting Medicaid reimbursements in June, and the state removed the clinics from its list of providers about two months later, when South Carolina officially received permission to carry out the high court’s order.
People who use the government-funded insurance can continue visiting the clinics, but they will have to cover any costs out of pocket.
Patients can pay for services offered at the clinics on a sliding scale, which allows low-income patients to pay only what they can afford based on how much they make. But health care often involves other costs Planned Parenthood can’t cover, such as getting a prescription or a lab test, Ringer said.
If a person can’t afford private insurance, they can’t afford prescriptions or test costs, either, she said.
Clinic shooting
The Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia also remained open following a nearby shooting last month.
Columbia police responded to reports of a shooting in a parking lot beside the Planned Parenthood clinic Nov. 14. Officers found a man who had been shot. He has since been released from the hospital, according to a Nov. 25 news release. Police never named the injured man or specified where on his body he was shot.
Anti-abortion advocate Mark Baumgartner was arrested on charges of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, as well as possessing a weapon during a violent crime, stemming from the shooting. He was released from jail Nov. 25 after posting a $50,000 bond, as long as he does not return to the location of the shooting, according to court records.
Baumgartner leads A Moment of Hope, which is a constant presence outside the Columbia clinic. Volunteers in bright green vests attempt to divert women walking into Planned Parenthood, in the hopes of preventing abortions, according to the nonprofit’s website.
Based on videos recorded on nearby security cameras and onlookers’ cellphones, Baumgartner and the man who was shot appeared to get into a physical fight outside the clinic. Police have not said what led to the fight.
Baumgartner did not respond to calls or emails seeking comment.

People seeking a commercial driver’s license would be charged with a second-degree misdemeanor under the bill if they receive “unauthorized assistance” on the part of the test that assesses ability to read and understand highway signs. Anyone who gives the assistance would be subject to the same charge.
That provision comes after the arrest of Harjinder Singh, an Indian national who is accused of killing three people when he made an illegal U-turn on Florida’s Turnpike. That story was the topic of political debate, particularly after it emerged that Singh’s commercial license had been issued by California, a Democratic-led state.

Sen. Darryl Rouson, a Democrat from St. Petersburg, asked whether gas-powered lawnmowers would fall under the scope of the bill. Truenow said they must be included to ensure a “level playing field.”
Solicitation
The bill would create a state law limiting door-to-door sales. Floridians would be able to post signs to keep their front doors free from solicitation. 
The intent is to “protect such private property rights by creating a uniform standard for notifying individuals or groups of individuals that commercial solicitation is prohibited on private property,” according to the bill.
The bill would impose “a noncriminal violation” punishable with a $500 fine for first offenders who solicit a house that has posted a sign warning against soliciting. Second offenses would be punishable as second-degree misdemeanors. 
The sign, as written in statute, would have to say: “THIS DWELLING IS DESIGNATED PRIVATE PROPERTY. NO COMMERCIAL SOLICITATION IS PERMITTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 501.062, FLORIDA STATUTES.”
Truenow specified during the meeting that the law would not make it illegal for political or religious door-knocking.
Additionally
Also in the 60-page bill is a proposed repeal of a law outlining Florida’s involvement in the Southern States Energy Compact, a non-profit that addresses energy and environmental policies. 
“According to the department, Florida has not used and does not anticipate using the services provided by the compact. Participating in the compact costs Florida approximately $45,000 annually,” according to the bill analysis. 
The bill would require people seeking emergency recovery agriculture loans to be citizens of Florida and the United States and entities to be owned and operated in the U.S. 
Lawmakers are also looking to make it illegal to have or use a signal jamming device, a first-degree misdemeanor. Signal jamming is already illegal under federal law.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Central-Florida-Farm-Tour-Visit-Central-Florida-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 17:59:23.467202

(Photo by Getty Images)A House comittee on Tuesday voted 14-6 to pass a bill that allows wrongful death lawsuits for the loss of developing fetuses, with a leading proponent claiming the legislation should be a harbinger of things to come for the anti-abortion movement in Florida.
“I want to emphasize to this committee that this bill should be the beginning of a broader expansion of civil remedies afforded under Florida law to hold accountable those who continue to take the lives of unborn children illegally in our state,” founder and executive director of Florida Voice for the Unborn Andrew Shirvell told members of the House Judiciary Committee.
Shirvell claimed there would be upward of 55,000 abortions provided in Florida by the end of the year. “And I guarantee, I guarantee those official numbers contain many, many, abortions, possibly thousands, being performed illegally without justification past the six-week limitation that went into effect on May 1, 2024,” he said.
Shirvell didn’t say where his data came from. The Agency for Health Care Administration’s abortion data for calendar year 2025 show that, as of Oct. 31, 36,857 terminations had been reported by Florida physicians and hospitals.
The House Judiciary Committee was the last stop for HB 289, which already been approved by the House Civil Justice and Claims Subcommittee last month over the objections of  Equality Florida, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, and Florida Now, which are known to closely track reproductive rights issues.

“We’ve said this before and we’ll say it again: By moving this bill forward, politicians are inviting irreparable harm to pregnant patients and deepening Florida’s maternal healthcare system crisis,” ACLU interim political director Kara Gross said in a statement.
“HB 289 is so far-reaching and overly broad that it allows any person who impregnates someone else — including an abusive ex-partner or rapist — to bring harassing litigation against individuals, doctors, hospitals, private businesses, and governmental entities for a loss of pregnancy from the moment of fertilization, by simply alleging that they were at fault,” she continued.
“This increased liability exposure will be devastating to any health care practitioner or hospital that treats pregnant patients, and is especially dangerous to OB/GYNs who specialize in high-risk pregnancies.”
But other groups that steer clear from abortion debates, such as the Florida Justice Reform Institute, which promotes legislation to reduce civil lawsuits against businesses, and the Doctor’s Co., the nation’s largest physician-owned medical malpractice carrier, also opposed the legislation.
Companion SB 164, by Fort Pierce Republican Sen. Erin Grall, faces an uphill battle in the Florida Senate, where the bill cleared its first committee by a 5-4 vote.
Damages for the death of an unborn child are not recoverable under the state’s wrongful death laws, which allow for recovery of medical or funeral bills and past and future pain and suffering. Damages may be recoverable for “negligent stillbirth” in a common-law proceeding. Those damages are limited to mental pain and anguish and medical expenses incurred incident to the pregnancy.
The House and Senate bills would allow parents to file wrongful death suits for unborn children, defined as a member of “the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.” Wrongful death suits allow damages for mental pain and loss of support, meaning jurors could determine the salary the fetus could have earned over its life as part of the damages to which parents could be entitled.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/abortion-law-stock-image-300x200-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 17:59:23.467202

(Getty Images)Last month, a Wall Street portfolio manager named Michael Green created a bit of a stir with a Substack article headlined, “How a broken benchmark quietly broke America.” His provocative economic argument, in a nutshell, amounts to the obliteration of an often cited but too-rarely dissected metric: the federal poverty line.
Green writes: “While trying to understand why the American middle class feels poorer each year despite healthy GDP (gross domestic product) growth and low unemployment, I came across a sentence buried in a research paper: ‘The U.S. poverty line is calculated as three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963, adjusted for inflation.’ … I felt sick.”
It’s sickening because the annual income that places an American family of four at the poverty line in 2025, using 1963 domestic budget math, is $32,150. By Green’s conservative calculations, that figure should be about $140,000.
The critical responses to Green’s argument, as collected by The Washington Post, are unsurprising. The American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, called it “laughable,” the Post’s Julie Zauzmer Weil reported, while George Mason University economist Alex Tabarrok said, “to think that we today are living in some hellish landscape compared to our parents and even our grandparents is just a complete distortion of reality.”
Tabarrok misses the point. As just about any working-class American family will tell you, the real “distortion of reality” is the idea that a family of four can do anything but suffer on $32,150 a year.
Green’s math isn’t novel. The Post story, for example, references the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s “Living Wage Calculator,” which estimates the living wage for a New Hampshire family of four, with two working adults, at $31.19 an hour. That adds up to an annual household income of $129,768. Also, back in October, a New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute analysis found that a family of four making the 2024 state median household income of $99,782 falls about $2,000 short of covering the collective cost of the mortgage on a median-priced home, child care for two children under 5, food, health care, and gas. Notice, too, the line items that aren’t included, like utility/heating costs and cellphone/broadband service, for example.
For those inclined to blame the poor for their poverty, let me try to anticipate some potential criticisms. 
Everyone has to live within their means, so maybe don’t buy a median-priced house if you can’t afford it. Fair enough, so let’s look at New Hampshire’s rental market. To afford a market-rate two-bedroom apartment in this state, which boasts the 12th most expensive rent in the country, you have to earn about $35 an hour, for an annual income of $72,971, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And if you’re going to do some itemized nitpicking, let me stop one of your 20th-century rants before it begins: Smartphones and broadband access are not luxury items in 21st-century America; they are a requirement for anyone who wishes to participate in society and the economy — the cost of the “participation ticket,” as Green calls it.
And then there’s the big criticism, articulated by Tabarrok in the Post story: “(Green) takes the poverty measure — and then turns it around and turns it into a middle-class measure.”
That’s the heart of it, isn’t it? What does it mean to be poor, and what does it mean to be middle class in this nation of profound economic inequality? Green’s piece carefully outlines the cost not of a life free of struggle but a decent life for an American family in 2025, in which the cost of housing, child care, health care — and here I invite you to calculate your own cost of living — are at the very least within reach. Does “within reach” add up to something close to the poverty line of $32,150? The New Hampshire median household income of $99,782? Green’s “conservative” estimate of $140,000?
One of those numbers is truly absurd, and it’s not Green’s.
Back in the spring, I tried to get at this idea in a personal way. Not to complain about my lot but to articulate a genuine befuddlement over how difficult it is to get by for a young family. I explained that my wife and I had worked hard, had lived well within our means, and it still wasn’t enough to make the numbers work. And in that moment when it felt like everything was crumbling, we were right at the median household income for a family of four.
We were not even close to poor by state or federal standards, but we were honestly one unexpected bill away from losing the battle to stay afloat. If you can relate to our middle-class challenges, if you can easily picture that kind of struggle, what kind of life, then, do you imagine for a family of four at the poverty line in 2025? 
For starters, they don’t live in a two-bedroom apartment, because that would cost more than two-thirds of their annual income. Maybe squeeze into a studio? Sorry, but that’s still about 45% of income — too high a ratio with other expenses like health care and transportation. Can a family at the poverty level afford child care for two children under 5, at a cost of $29,082? Of course not. But what happens to that household income when one parent stays home to care for the children, out of necessity?
Life crumbles a little more.
In New Hampshire and nationally, lawmakers talk a lot about the poverty line while debating elements of the social safety net, especially when it comes to “responsible” cuts. For example, Gov. Kelly Ayotte, in trying to spin her newly adopted premiums for Medicaid enrollees, suggested that truly “vulnerable” residents wouldn’t be affected. Only those making 255% of the federal poverty line would have to pay up to 5% of their household income toward the premiums. 
What does the ledger look like for such a family? They earn $81,983 annually, which leaves them nearly $20,000 below the state median. We also know that a family at the median, by the Fiscal Policy Institute’s calculations, finishes the year about $2,000 in the red just when it comes to meeting basic expenses. So things are beyond tight for our family of four at 255% of the poverty line, and Ayotte’s new 5% premium leaves them about $4,100 deeper in the hole. That is why Democrats rightfully called the premium an “income tax on the poor.”
That’s the problem with the poverty line as it currently exists: It misstates, by a huge degree, the cost of getting by. Even worse, it provides lawmakers with a false premise on which to implement social safety net cuts that compound poverty.
I really hope you’ll read Green’s piece, and the Post story on the reaction. I hope you’ll consider, too, how and why vast inequality endangers everyone, even those who benefit most.
And, I hope you’ll think honestly about the kind of life available to a young New Hampshire family at the official threshold of poverty in America and ask yourself this question:
Which of life’s necessities should we as a society be comfortable denying to those we consider poor?",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/povertyline-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 17:59:23.467202

Jared Polis, seen during a 2024 press conference at the Colorado Capitol, echoed the Colorado Department of Corrections in saying the state is not fulfilling the Trump administration's request to transfer Tina Peters. (Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)The office of Colorado Gov. Jared Polis affirmed this week a decision by state prison officials not to fulfill a request by the Trump administration to transfer custody of Tina Peters from the state to federal authorities.
Peters, the former Republican Mesa County clerk, is serving a 9-year prison sentence for her role in a scheme to breach the security of her own election equipment. President Donald Trump has repeatedly demanded that she be released.
The director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons sent a letter to the Colorado Department of Corrections last month requesting that the state “initiate the transfer” of Peters to the bureau. 
“Requests to transfer inmates from the Colorado Department of Corrections emanate from the state, and not from other entities. The state has not made any requests to transfer this inmate,” Shelby Wieman, a Polis spokesperson, said in a text to Newsline.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
This almost exactly repeats a statement from Department of Corrections spokesperson Christian Andrade, who also wrote in an email to Newsline that “the Department is not currently seeking any transfer.”
Peters, 70, is incarcerated at La Vista Correctional Facility in Pueblo. She was convicted by a Mesa County jury on multiple charges, including four felonies, and sentenced October 2024. She was the linchpin in an effort to find evidence that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. There is no credible evidence that the election results were compromised.
Trump cannot pardon Peters, because she was convicted on state charges. But he has called for the U.S. Department of Justice to take “all necessary action” to get her released. In August, he promised “harsh measures” if she were not let out of jail “right now.”
A bipartisan group of local election officials last week made an impassioned plea to Polis that he reject the Trump administration’s transfer request, saying failure to do so would set a dangerous precedent. Almost two weeks elapsed between the administration’s formal transfer request and the first indications that the state Department of Corrections would resist it, and Polis’ previous silence on the matter was a widespread source of indignation among election security proponents.
“His silence is deafening, and it’s also offensive,” said Molly Fitzpatrick, the Boulder County clerk, during a press conference last week.
Peters has appealed her conviction in state court and she is pursuing a habeas corpus petition in the U.S. District Court of Colorado, where she argues she should be released on bond. On Sunday she asked the court for an emergency ruling, saying her 97-year-old mother is in intensive care in Virginia and she wants to travel there to visit.
Peters’ lawyer, Florida-based Peter Ticktin, calls Peters a “political prisoner.” During a recent appearance on Steve Bannon’s podcast, he suggested presidents actually do have the power to pardon people who have been convicted of state crimes and that he intends to pursue such a claim in Peters’ case up to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. He also said he thinks the Trump administration should use the U.S. military to free Peters from the Colorado prison by force.

Free.,"Student coalition, Dem lawmakers object to Trump Education Department moves",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/student-coalition-dem-lawmakers-object-trump-education-department-moves,,"WASHINGTON — A pair of Democratic lawmakers joined student leaders Tuesday in blasting President Donald Trump’s ongoing efforts to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. U.S. Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois, alongside college and high school students from across the United States, rebuked the Trump administration’s plans to shift several of the Education Department’s responsibilities to other Cabinet-level agencies as part of a larger effort to abolish the 46-year-old Education Department. Markey said Trump’s and Education Secretary Linda McMahon’s “dismantling of the department will have immediate negative consequences for students, for families, for local schools nationwide,” during a virtual press conference organized by “Hands Off Our Schools,” a coalition encompassing student government leaders from Washington, D.C.“When a parent or superintendent needs support or technical assistance, there will be no one to pick up the phone,” he said. McMahon defended the move at a Nov. 20 White House press briefing, saying “these interagency agreements to cut our own bureaucratic bloat are a key step in our efforts to shift educational authority from Washington, D.C., to your state education agency, your local superintendent, your local school board — entities that are accountable to you.” But Markey and Underwood said the administration’s moves would have deeply negative impacts.“The Trump agenda to destroy the Department of Education is not about cutting red tape — it is about enacting cruelty and intentionally breaking the programs that ensure the promise of education is delivered to every single student,” Markey said. Underwood said “this administration’s attacks on our Department of Education are part of a much larger assault on the very foundations of our constitutional rights and our democracy.”She added that “by tearing down the Department of Education, this administration has made an explicit choice to abandon students and families.” Underwood — who is a registered nurse — also took aim at the department’s proposal stemming from congressional Republicans’ “big, beautiful” law that would place stricter loan limits on students pursuing graduate nursing programs because they would not fall under the “professional” degree classification. She said the effort is “devastating for our already overburdened nursing workforce, and it’s a disaster for our health care system, especially in rural communities.” ‘Brainless decision’ Students from California, Texas, Virginia and Washington, D.C., also slammed the department’s plans to transfer responsibilities to other agencies and potential impacts on marginalized students. “This brainless decision to shift programs out of the (Education Department) is targeting the most vulnerable among us,” Darius Wagner, a student at Georgetown University, said, describing the move as “unnecessarily cruel.” “Other federal departments that now (bear) this responsibility do not have the resources, staff or expertise to manage these programs and will inevitably mismanage resources that will leave our most vulnerable children behind,” Wagner added.Ayaan Moledina, a high school student in Austin, Texas, said “dismantling and destroying the department will lead to major consequences on the success of marginalized students.” Moledina, who serves as federal policy director of the advocacy group Students Engaged in Advancing Texas (SEAT), said that “without a federal department, there will be no federal oversight of institutions to guarantee the basic and fundamental rights of students.” He added: “There will be no federal assistance for institutions to implement federally mandated programs, putting more of a burden on schools that already have their plates full.” Six interagency agreements The agreements to transfer several of the Education Department’s responsibilities to four other departments drew swift condemnation from Democratic officials, labor unions and advocacy groups, who questioned the legality of the effort and voiced concerns about the harm that would be imposed on students, families and schools as a result. The Education Department clarified that it would “maintain all statutory responsibilities and will continue its oversight of these programs” regarding its six agreements signed with Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services and State.Prior to the six announced interagency agreements, the agency had already undergone a slew of changes that the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily greenlit in July, including mass layoffs that gutted more than 1,300 employees and a plan to dramatically downsize the department ordered earlier this year.",,,,2025-12-02 17:59:23.467202

Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died as a result of her injuries, and U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains in the hospital with severe wounds. D.C. Superior Court Magistrate Judge Renee Raymond denied bond for 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who officials allege drove across the United States to the district from his residence in Washington state. The guard members were attacked while on duty in a downtown neighborhood blocks from the White House.“He came across the country 3,000 miles, armed with a specific purpose in mind,” Judge Raymond said in her reasoning for denying him bond. “The government’s case is exceedingly strong.”The U.S. Attorney’s Office filed charges Tuesday for first-degree murder while armed; possession of a firearm; and assault with the intent to kill. Lakanwal’s next court date is Jan. 14.“The nature and circumstances of the instant offense, the strength of the government’s case, and the sheer terror that resulted, that continues to animate because of his actions, leads me to conclude that no conditions or combination of conditions, will reasonably ensure the safety of the community,” Raymond said.West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey wrote on social media Tuesday that Wolfe “remains in critical condition but is stable.”“Doctors and the family are optimistic about his current progress and note that he has responded to some basic requests such as a thumbs up sign and wiggling his toes,” Morrisey said.Troops in the districtThe West Virginia National Guard members shot last week are among the 2,000 troops stationed in the district since August, after President Donald Trump declared a “crime emergency.” Republican governors have offered to send their states’ reserves of National Guard members to the nation’s capital. A federal judge last month found the president’s deployment of troops to the district illegal. Lakanwal was granted asylum this year after he came to the United States through a special humanitarian program for Afghanistan allies who served along American forces and had to flee the country after the Taliban took it over following the chaotic U.S. withdrawal in 2021. The shooting that took place on the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday has resulted in Trump expanding his immigration crackdown to include a halt to asylum applications, as well as increased scrutiny on visa applications from Afghan nationals. “In the wake of last week's atrocity, it is more important than ever to finish carrying out the president's mass deportation operation,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at Monday’s press briefing. “They must go back to their home countries.”Translator appears for LakanwalDuring Tuesday’s arraignment, Lakanwal seemed to thrash around in pain in his hospital bed. A translator also appeared virtually for Lakanwal. Lakanwal’s lawyer raised concerns about U.S. Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro, a former Fox News host, holding future press conferences, warning that could harm a “free and fair trial” for Lakanwal. Pirro held a press conference on Thanksgiving morning to discuss the shooting.“The government at their own peril … continue to taint a potential jury pool against Mr. Lakanwal as a result of their press conferences,” he said.Department of Defense press secretary Kingsley Wilson said during a Tuesday briefing at the Pentagon that all National Guard members in the district would be armed. Following last week’s shooting, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he would request an additional 500 National Guard members be deployed in the district. It’s unclear if that directive would violate a federal judge’s order that found the August deployment unlawful. The federal judge stayed her Nov. 20 order for three weeks to give the administration time to either appeal or remove the troops. The Trump administration filed an emergency appeal after the shooting in the district.Ashley Murray contributed to this report.",,,,2025-12-02 17:59:23.467202

The Ames university will seek approval from the Iowa Board of Regents for individual building site plans included in the CyTown development project at a virtual meeting Wednesday.
The project’s overall site plan was already approved by the board in January, along with ownership and lease structures and optional real estate services. ISU has entered into a 30-year management agreement with Goldenrod Companies and Iowa State University Research Park for the development, which is being directed by a management committee made up of board of regents members and leaders from both ISU and the research park.
ISU already approved the site development lease plans, board documents stated, and the committee had input in its creation.

ISU General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer Michael Norton said during the board’s January meeting the project will cost between $175 million and $225 million to complete. According to a presentation published online by the board of regents ahead of its Wednesday meeting, total building costs for the project will come in at more than $139.6 million.
The presentation also stated that $184 million in net revenue will be generated by CyTown for the university over the next 30 years.

Included in the CyTown site development lease plans are overviews, renderings and projected budgets for the majority of the area’s buildings, excluding the already-constructed McFarland Clinic and a hotel still in its design phase. McFarland Clinic is a health care clinic with primary, urgent and specialty care and is the “anchor tenant” for CyTown.
Described in the plan as “the glue that holds all of CyTown together,” Cyclone Alley will run through the center of the development, expanding access to the university bus system and ending in an amphitheater for entertainment. According to renderings in the board document, Cyclone Alley will include an “Alumni Walk” walkway with landscaping and water.
“The signature piece of this building is Cylo, a versatile amphitheater at the north end of the alley, ready to host acts of all sizes,” the plan stated. “A massive digital backdrop enhances the immersive experience for up to 3,500 people on the viewing lawn.”
This portion of the development will cost just under $19.4 million, according to the lease plan.

With the Cylo taking point at the north end of CyTown, the mixed-use buildings on the west end of the development between the amphitheater and McFarland Clinic are both slated to house retail spaces and units for “both short-and-long-term stays,” the lease plan stated.
Both buildings will have entertainment spaces on the second floor — building C will boast views of Jack Trice Stadium and building E will “provide a premium space for those to attend events at Cylo, creating a distinctive setting for gatherings and events within CyTown.”
The project budget for building C, with a building area of more than 83,000 square feet and five levels, totals more than $27.9 million in the lease plan. Building E will also have five levels and include almost 82,500 square footage, and will cost more than $27.6 million.
A “Food & Beverage Anchor Building” will sit across from the McFarland Clinic on the south side of the development, according to the plan. It will house two dining vendors, one for each floor of the building. The total building area is more than 16,800 square feet and will cost more than $5.8 million.

“Its location provides convenient access for stadium visitors, nearby clinic patrons, and those looking to enjoy the lively atmosphere along Cyclone Alley,” the lease plan stated.
The remaining two buildings on the east side of the development, buildings D and F, will be used for retail and office spaces. Building F will also have a terrace on its second level with seating that can be used to view Cylo events. Building F has a total project budget of more than $29.8 million and building E will cost just under $29 million.
According to board documents, Goldenrod and McFarland Clinic will together invest $185 million in land and building construction and improvements for the project, and ISU has already invested $30 million to replace parking lots and civil infrastructure.

Andy Kim spent months fighting New Jersey Democratic Party leaders in 2024 over the county line, with Kim defeating them in court multiple times and then handily winning election to his current seat last year.
Judging by the reception Kim received in committee room six at the Trenton Statehouse annex on Monday, there are still a lot of hurt feelings on the losing side.
Kim was there to testify against a bill to revamp the state comptroller’s office, a measure sponsored by Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D) that has sparked outrage in the state’s progressive circles. Normally, state lawmakers give their fellow elected officials a chance to testify first during committee hearings, but Kim’s fellow Democrats decided to make him wait.
The push to punish an NJ school board member for Facebook posts is foolish

So Kim waited. And waited. And waited. Even when some witnesses who were called to speak before Kim said they would cede their time to him so he could testify and then head to D.C., state Sen. Jim Beach (D-Camden), the chair of the committee hearing the bill, said no.
“Nobody’s special,” Beach said. “I have a list, and we’re going in order.”
Beach even read a seemingly never-ending list of names of people who said they didn’t want to testify before calling Kim’s name.
When it was Kim’s turn to speak, Beach was peevish, cutting Kim off the second Kim spoke beyond the three-minute deadline Beach had earlier implemented, seemingly just for critics of the bill.
“Sir, I have been here for five-and-a-half hours,” Kim told Beach.
“Yeah, so what?” Beach responded. “So has everyone else. Why do you think you’re special? You’re not.”
Listen, I’m all for the Legislature not giving special treatment to dignitaries and forcing them to wait in line with the rest of the hoi polloi when bills are getting heard. But that’s not how it generally goes in Trenton, where even Jim McGreevey, the former governor who resigned two decades ago after getting caught hiring his secret boyfriend to a state job with a six-figure salary, gets to cut in line when he wants to testify on a bill. Surely a sitting senator can get the same treatment as a disgraced former governor.
Scutari’s comments to reporters prior to Monday’s hearing indicate Beach’s decision to keep Kim waiting was a strategy, not an attempt to be fair to the masses. They thought he would eventually bail and return to D.C., which is where Scutari said Kim should have been on Monday.
“I think he should be in Washington overseeing what he’s supposed to be doing there instead of coming here and criticizing a bill that he hadn’t had an opportunity to read yet, and asking me to get up there first and asking me for special treatment in terms of the hearing. I doubt that he remains here,” Scutari said.

Kim told me he had indeed read the bill and that he did not ask for special treatment, saying he arrived at the Statehouse 90 minutes before the hearing started to make sure he could get his name early on the speaker list (I can confirm some of that; I was behind him at security when he entered the building).
As for Beach’s hostility, Kim said he doesn’t know where it came from. He said he’s met Beach maybe once before, and cannot recall a single face-to-face conversation they’ve ever had.
Kim said what stuck out to him about Monday’s hearing was an interaction Beach had during Kim’s testimony with another person in the audience. This was after Beach said Kim had to stop speaking because of Beach’s made-up three-minute rule.
“I yielded my three minutes to Sen. Kim,” the audience member said.
“I don’t care about you,” Beach shot back.
Kim said he’s been thinking about Beach’s response for the last 24 hours.
“That is just such a disgraceful thing to say to a fellow New Jerseyan, to people that we represent. I can never imagine, no matter how much someone would yell at me about Trump or anything else, I just cannot ever imagine the words coming out of my mouth,” he said. “It’s the opposite of what public service and being an elected official’s about.”
Kim is right that Beach’s behavior Monday represents the opposite of what being an elected official is all about. But sadly, it’s too often what being an elected official in Trenton is all about.

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Add Rhode Island to the list of states facing legal action from the Trump administration for refusing to turn over personal voter information.
The U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit, filed in federal court in Rhode Island Tuesday morning, comes amid a nationwide federal probe into state voter rolls under the pretense of preventing election fraud, including noncitizen voting — which is extremely rare. Since May, the Justice Department has reached out to at least 40 states seeking voter lists, including personal information typically protected under state and federal laws, like Social Security and driver’s license numbers.
Rhode Island Secretary of State Gregg Amore refused to comply, responding to the DOJ probe in September by offering to provide a free copy of the statewide voter list already publicly available — typically provided upon request with a $25 fee. But Amore made clear he would not hand over confidential personal information without legal action.
More than two-and-a-half months later, the DOJ answered. The 10-page complaint echoes the same arguments made in its lawsuits against eight other states, including Maine and New Hampshire. 
In all of the cases, federal attorneys say the government is entitled to personal voter data under the 1960 Civil Rights Act, the 2002 Help America Vote Act (HAVA) and the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993.
The lawsuit, which names Amore as a defendant, seeks a federal judge’s intervention to force Amore to turn over the voter registration information within five days, while declaring his refusal a violation of the Civil Rights Act.
Amore, a former high school history teacher, maintained the DOJ’s request was unconstitutional in a statement Tuesday. 
“This lawsuit, like those filed in other states, is a continuation of the current presidential administration’s unconstitutional attempts to interfere with elections processes across the country,” Amore said. “One of my most important responsibilities as the chief state election official is safeguarding the data privacy of Rhode Islanders, who entrust us with their personal information when they register to vote. I will continue to fight to protect it.”
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said he will stand with and defend the secretary in court.
“This lawsuit is just the latest example of the weaponization of the Department of Justice to further the Trump Administration’s unlawful whims,” Neonha said in a statement. “I’m not surprised that this Administration is confused about what it means to behave lawfully.”
The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island backed up Amore, calling the federal probe “a major threat to the privacy of Rhode Island voters.” 
“Drivers’ licenses and social security numbers provided as part of the voter registration process are sensitive pieces of information that deserve to be protected and that the Department of Justice has absolutely no legitimate need for,” the ACLU said in a statement Tuesday.
Most state election officials, like Amore, have declined to provide the DOJ with full access to their voter rolls. In Nebraska and South Carolina, voters have filed state lawsuits preventing state election officials from sharing their private information. On the other end of the spectrum, Indiana and Wyoming agreed to hand over driver’s license and Social Security numbers in compliance with the DOJ’s request, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.
Officials in Florida, Indiana, Iowa and Ohio have also agreed to help the Trump administration tap into state driver’s license data under a settlement between the states and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security filed on Friday.
The DOJ claims that state and local election officials have no discretion to limit federal election records or papers. Rhode Island’s rejection of  the voter data request undermines the DOJ’s ability to investigate states under the 1960 Civil Rights Act, the lawsuit claims.
DOJ attorneys also sought to dispel Amore’s concerns over voters’ privacy. The administration’s memo claims that the assistant attorney general who requested the data from Amore’s office made clear that officials would comply with federal privacy laws. Moreover, the DOJ  noted that Amore’s office was instructed to use encrypted email or the DOJ’s secure file-sharing system to provide the voter data.
The DOJ may claim it has the right to privileged voter data, but Common Cause Rhode Island Executive Director John Marion said Tuesday that the 1974 Privacy Act lays out strict guidelines for what exactly states can provide to the federal government. He said Amore’s decision to deny the full voter roll was the right decision.
“He’ll ultimately prevail in this litigation, because the law is on his side,” Marion said.
Marion called the demands by the DOJ a “fishing expedition” by the Trump administration to continue to sow distrust in elections, along with pushing the false claim that the 2020 race was “stolen.”
“Rhode Island shouldn’t be participating in an effort to discredit those election results,” he said. 
The DOJ’s lawsuit has been assigned to Judge Mary S. McElroy, a first-term Trump appointee.

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey officials’ three-year effort to investigate a network of Christian antiabortion pregnancy centers accused of using deceptive practices landed before the U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday, when justices heard arguments over the narrow jurisdictional question of whether the case belongs in state or federal court.
Since 2023, lawyers for First Choice Women’s Resource Centers have been fighting a subpoena Attorney General Matt Platkin issued for a wide array of the nonprofit’s records and communications, including donors’ names.
In New Jersey, state courts have the power to handle subpoena disputes. But First Choice sued in federal court to block enforcement, saying that the subpoena unconstitutionally chills its free-speech and free-association rights and that federal courts should decide constitutional challenges.
Tuesday, First Choice’s attorney Erin Morrow Hawley urged the justices to protect donor privacy, consider Platkin’s motives, and consider his “coercive” subpoena a violation of the First Amendment. Such a ruling would reverse earlier decisions by a U.S. federal judge and a federal appeals panel that the case should remain in state court, at least until a state judge decides whether First Choice’s noncompliance warrants sanctions.
“The attorney general of New Jersey issued a sweeping subpoena commanding — on pain of contempt — that First Choice produced donor names, addresses, and phone numbers so his office could contact and question them,” said Hawley, adding, “This is the context of a hostile attorney general who has issued a consumer alert, urged New Jerseyans to beware of pregnancy centers, and assembled a strike force against them.”
Hawley is a former law clerk of Chief Justice John Roberts. Vivek Suri, assistant to the Solicitor General in the U.S. Department of Justice, joined Hawley in arguing on First Choice’s behalf, saying people with a constitutional challenge always have standing in federal court.
Sundeep Iyer, Platkin’s chief counsel, warned that restricting constitutional challenges solely to federal judges would clog the courts and represent “a pretty dramatic sea change in historical practice.” Platkin’s office alone has issued more than 500 subpoenas this year to people and companies it’s investigating, while Google got about 50,000 subpoenas last year, Iyer added.
“State and local governments issue tens of thousands of subpoenas every year, but the federal government’s theory would risk turning many of these ordinary subpoena disputes into federal cases,” Iyer said. “Even without a First Amendment claim, that would be a remarkable break from history and tradition. No court has accepted that theory, and this court should not be the first.”

The case made for unusual allies, with groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression siding with the Alliance Defending Freedom, the Christian legal advocacy group where Hawley works. In an August amicus brief, the ACLU and the foundation fretted about “censorship by intimidation” and warned that authorities of all political persuasions increasingly are using their powers, including subpoenas, to squelch disfavored speech as society grows more polarized.
Over 90 minutes of arguments Tuesday, both sides strayed far from the jurisdictional issue and the justices peppered attorneys with a steady stream of questions.
The justices mulled the purpose of Platkin’s request for donor details (to see if donors thought their contributions were going to an abortion-rights group) and whether compliance with subpoenas is mandatory (no, unless a judge orders compliance). The jurists also debated the “degree of chill” that might deter donors and if a letter of request instead of a subpoena would have sparked the same court fight.
They wrangled with whether the mere receipt of a subpoena can cause “imminent injury” or pose a “credible threat,” if courts have not yet sanctioned — and might not ever — a noncompliant recipient. First Choice attorneys argued that they suffered harms in the cost of the legal fight, anticipated losses of charitable contributions from donors who fear public disclosure, and possible regulatory retaliation if they don’t comply with the subpoena. Platkin’s team had called claims of such harms speculative.
Some justices’ opinions seemed clear in their questioning.
Justice Clarence Thomas asked Iyer whether investigators had received any reports of deceptive practices by First Choice, and Iyer conceded they had not.
“You say you have no complaints. But rather you looked at the website and their materials, and you think it could have been misleading,” Thomas said.
Subpoenaing donor information “just seems to be a burdensome way to find out whether someone has a confusing website,” he added.
Tax law requires charitable organizations to identify major donors in tax filings in order to retain their tax-exempt status. That law also is being challenged in federal court in Ohio.
Hawley urged the justices to reject Iyer’s claim that subpoenas are voluntary, negotiable, and not intimidating.
Subpoenas “would terrify normal donors, mom-and-pop donors,” Hawley said. “If you look at the allegations in this case, some donors gave as little as $10. Those folks are going to be worried about a state attorney general, the highest law enforcement officer in the country, demanding their names, phone numbers, addresses, places of employment so that he can contact them about a donor website.”

First Choice has five centers in Jersey City, Montclair, Morristown, Newark, and New Brunswick.
A decision is expected by the summer.

(Screenshot: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)As North Carolina shoppers make their holiday purchases online, more and more of them are opting to click a relatively new button allowing them to “buy now, pay later.”
That option may look like a good way to stretch a tight budget during the holidays. But North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson warned Monday that using “buy now, pay later,” or BNPL, services could place shoppers at risk of incurring massive debt.  Jackson and six other attorneys general sent letters to leading BNPL lenders this week to determine whether they are abiding by consumer protection laws.
“Buy-Now-Pay-Later loans may seem simple and safe, but they can lead to surprise fees and growing debt,” Jackson said in a statement. “Laws exist to protect North Carolinians from predatory lenders, and we are going to make sure these lenders are following the law.”
The programs work by allowing shoppers to break up purchases into smaller payments, typically on a monthly basis, through automated bank withdrawals. While many consumers use them to make expensive purchases more manageable, the offerings have exploded in recent years, with even food delivery services offering customers the option to pay on a monthly basis.
If customers fall behind on payments, some companies charge late fees, which can quickly accumulate into larger debts. Automatic withdrawals that bounce can also trigger bank overdraft fees and reports to credit institutions, making it harder for consumers to qualify for loans in the future.
The letters, sent to financial companies Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, PayPal, Sezzle, and Zip, include a battery of questions around how each addresses payment disputes, late repayments, eligibility determination, and credit reporting among other loan terms.
“We are concerned that BNPL companies might not be providing their customers with appropriate protections when they return their purchase, never receive what they ordered, or experience other billing errors,” the attorneys general wrote. “We are also concerned that BNPL providers may not adequately assess borrowers’ capacity to repay their loans.”
The use of BNPL programs rose sharply during the pandemic as an alternative to credit cards. According to a 2024 Federal Reserve report, 15% of adult survey respondents said they had used such a service in the last 12 months, up from 10% in 2021. Of those, roughly a quarter said they paid late, up from 15% in 2021.
More than half said they shopped with BNPL because they could not afford their purchases otherwise. Among respondents making under $50,000 a year, that percentage spiked to 72%. And while services vary over whether they charge late fees, a majority of respondents reported they were charged extra for missing payment dates.
Miranda Margowsky, a spokesperson for the Financial Technology Association, which represents Afterpay, Klarna, PayPal, and Zip among other financial technology companies, said their consumer data shows that responsible use of the services, including “repaying in full and on time,” is the norm.
“BNPL is a valued payment method that allows people to split the cost of a purchase into four installments with no interest, no revolving debt, and no hidden fees,” Margowsky said. “These products are safe, regulated, and consumer-friendly, with a business model centered on consumer success, not fees.”
Klarna spokesperson Clare Nordstrom said the company “has built strong safeguards” into its program, including eligibility assessments and service pauses after missed payments. Those protections, she said, have helped ensure a more than 99% repayment rate.
Affirm spokesperson Brian Levin noted that the company does not charge late fees and that they are eager to engage with lawmakers on regulatory concerns. “Our success is aligned with consumers and responsibly extending access to credit. We underwrite every transaction individually and we provide consistent and transparent disclosures at checkout.”
According to North Carolina Department of Justice spokesperson Nazneen Ahmed, their office has received dozens of complaints against BNPL lenders, including 53 against Affirm and nine against Klarna. NCDOJ has also received 454 complaints against PayPal, but most relate to other services offered by the financial technology company.
The inquiry is the latest in a series of legal efforts by Jackson’s office to protect consumers in the ever-growing online commerce sector. Last month, he joined a letter to e-commerce platform Shopify over cutting ties with unlawful tobacco storefronts.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Klarna-Pay-Later-Option.png,,,2025-12-02 16:57:18.978017

Patric J. Ferguson, 34, pleaded guilty in August to civil rights, firearms, kidnapping and obstruction charges connected with the fatal shooting of 30-year-old Robert Howard.
“This defendant committed a premeditated murder while using his position as a police officer, not to protect the Memphis community, but to perpetuate this horrendous crime and shield himself from suspicion and liability,” Assistant Attorney General Harriet K. Dhillon of the U.S Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division stated in a Monday news release.
“While no prison sentence can undo the defendant’s heartless crimes, today’s sentence holds the defendant accountable and sends a clear message that no one is above the law,” Dhillon stated.
Ferguson used a police database to search for Howard, who at the time was in a relationship with a woman who previously dated Ferguson, according to Ferguson’s plea documents. He then used his department-issued patrol car to kidnap Howard from the woman’s home on January 5, 2021, according to Ferguson’s plea documents.
Ferguson then drove to a nearby parking lot and fatally shot Howard. Later, Ferguson conspired with Joshua M. Rogers, a childhood friend, to dispose of Howard’s body in the Wolf River in Memphis, court records state. Rogers and Ferguson then sold the vehicle they used to transport the body to a scrap metal company in Mississippi.
The FBI’s Nashville Field Office and the Memphis Police Department investigated the case. 
The department arrested Ferguson in January 2021 and immediately released him from duty, according to a statement posted on Jan. 10, 2021 on the department’s social media. Ferguson had been employed by MPD since October 2018. 
Rogers pleaded guilty in May to obstruction charges and is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 17.
Ferguson pleaded guilty to deprivation of rights under the color of law; kidnapping; use and discharge of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence causing death, conspiracy to tamper with a witness, victim or informant; and obstruction of justice, according to judgment documents.

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Repairs to water-damaged, cracking plaster at the South Dakota Capitol in Pierre will be complete by the time lawmakers convene in the building for the 2026 legislative session in January.
Darin Seeley, commissioner of the Bureau of Human Resources and Administration, told lawmakers Tuesday on the Joint Appropriations Committee that the fixes are the first phase of a three-phase restoration effort.
Capitol restoration looms as a major expense for South Dakota

The money for the current work came from a $3 million pool of funds approved by legislators earlier this year.
Once the plaster repairs are complete in the hallways and the galleries of the Senate and House of Representatives, second phase work can begin with repairs to the Rotunda. That work is set to begin after the 2026 session’s March conclusion, and is expected to be complete by November.
The third phase won’t repair a thing, at least not right away. Seeley told the committee that his agency plans to spend about $780,000 to hire a consultant for a comprehensive needs analysis meant to identify issues across the whole of the Capitol complex.
The building’s communications infrastructure needs an upgrade, Seeley said, as part of a “multi-year, multi-phase restoration of this building.”
“There is a lot of work that needs to be done for two reasons,” Seeley said. “One, to make the Capitol as beautiful as it can be, but more importantly, to bring it up to modern standards in relationship to electrical codes, plumbing and then usability of the space.” 
When a committee of legislators asked Seeley in August to guess what a full Capitol restoration might cost, he said “we’re talking probably between $150 million and $200 million.” The building hasn’t undergone a full restoration in about four decades.

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)A proposal to give roughly $1.3 million in bonus pay for 12 Retirement and Investment Office employees took a step forward Tuesday after officials had tabled the matter due to a legal question. 
The bonuses are intended to reward the employees for outperforming revenue benchmarks for four of the state’s investment funds.
The State Investment Board originally planned to approve the funding in a November meeting, but delayed taking action after a board member asked whether the board had the legal authority to do so.
While a state law adopted in 2023 permits staff who oversee state investments to receive the performance-based pay, it doesn’t specifically say the Retirement and Investment Office has authorization to provide the bonuses. 
“They have the authority for the program, but no specific budgetary authority to make those payments,” Office of Management and Budget Director Joe Morrissette, who sits on the State Investment Board, said at a Tuesday Emergency Commission meeting.
The Attorney General’s Office verbally advised the Retirement and Investment Office that the agency could safely move forward with approving the bonus pay, Retirement and Investment Office Executive Director Jodi Smith said.
The matter was brought to the Emergency Commission on Tuesday out of an abundance of caution, Smith said. The Emergency Commission, which consists of the governor, legislative leaders and the secretary of state, addresses funding issues that come up between legislative sessions.
Smith rescinded the request after the Emergency Commission ultimately decided that it did not need to take action.
Some commission members signaled interest in amending the statute at a later date to make the agency’s appropriation authority more explicit.
“I think it was written in a way that there was not clarity,” said Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the Emergency Commission as well as the State Investment Board.
The State Investment Board will vote on the bonuses at its next meeting, which is scheduled for January, according to Sarah Mudder, communication and outreach director for the Retirement and Investment Office.
North Dakota investment board delays action on $1.3 million in employee bonuses

The Retirement and Investment Office invests state money on behalf of the State Investment Board, some of which is managed by in-house investors. The top four funds are the Legacy Fund, the Public Employees Retirement System, the Teachers Fund for Retirement and Workforce Safety and Insurance.
The agency introduced the bonuses to encourage investment managers and other staff at the Retirement and Investment Office to bring in more money for the state, as well as to improve retention and recruitment. It was added at the same time North Dakota began an initiative to manage more of its investment money in-house.
If approved, this would be the first time the bonuses are awarded. The bonuses are funded by earnings on the agency’s investments. Seven of the bonuses awaiting approval are more than $100,000, with the largest more than $293,000. 
For employees to get the bonuses this year, the State Investment Board’s top four funds had to exceed certain earnings benchmarks between July 1, 2024, and June 30, 2025, Smith said previously.
The benchmarks are meant to represent standard market performance, she said. The funds outperformed the benchmarks by more than $191 million.
“$191 million more than the benchmark — that’s a big deal,” House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson, said during Tuesday’s meeting. “That deserves a pat on the back.” 
Armstrong previously expressed reservations about the bonus pay program, which was adopted before he became governor. He said at November’s State Investment Board meeting that he was under the impression the bonuses would be more difficult to obtain. 
He reaffirmed those concerns on Tuesday, and said while he doesn’t want to take away pay that was promised to investment staff, the State Investment Board would likely revisit the policy in the future. He said he wasn’t convinced the bonuses would help North Dakota attract employees.
“They don’t care about what their potential bonus is,” Armstrong said. “They care about what the base pay is.”

(Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Sen. Tom Willis, a freshman Republican member from Berkeley County, will lead the Senate Judiciary Committee. It’s one of the state Senate’s most powerful committees, where changes to state law are often vetted.
Willis is also running for the U.S. Senate, vying to replace current Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito. 
“I am humbled and honored that the Senate President asked me to serve in this leadership role for our great state,” said Willis, R-Berkeley. “As Judiciary chair, I will continue my public service to the wonderful people of West Virginia, a journey I started 25 years ago when I joined the West Virginia National Guard in 2000.”
The Judiciary Chair position was empty after Mike Stuart left the Senate earlier this year to serve as legal counsel in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump. 
Senate President Randy Smith, R-Preston
Senate President Randy Smith announced on Tuesday that Willis will lead the Judiciary Committee, effective immediately. 
“His extensive knowledge and background made him a natural fit,” Smith, R-Preston, said in a statement. “I am honored that he was willing to step up and take on this challenge, and I am confident he’s dedicated to making the lives of West Virginians and their families better.”
Willis, who is from Hedgesville and describes himself as a “Christian Constitutional Conservative,” previously served as the Vice Chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
“Judiciary is one of our busiest and most important committees, and I knew that I needed a strong, reliable leader to fill that role,” Smith said. 
Willis — an attorney and businessman — was elected in November 2024 to represent the fifth district, which includes portions of Berkeley, Morgan and Hampshire counties. Ahead of his election, Willis, in the May primary election, unseated longtime Democrat Senate President Craig Blair. Blair had held the seat for 12 years.
Willis has served as a Special Forces Green Beret with the West Virginia National Guard. 
He ran for U.S. Senate in 2018, coming in fourth in the Republican primary.

In July, he kicked off a campaign again for U.S. Senate.
“While I am a declared candidate for U.S. Senate in 2026 because it is time for a change, rest assured I will give 110% to my work as Judiciary Chair as we work together in the Legislature to improve economic prosperity for all West Virginians, improve education outcomes and protect our personal liberties,” Willis said. 
Capito is expected to run for reelection next year in an attempt to secure her third six-year term.

Sodecia and Aapico — a pair of family-owned automotive industry manufacturers — will jointly run a new 400,000-square-foot facility to build vehicle frames for use in electric SUVs and trucks assembled at the Scout campus nearly 60 miles to the north.
“This announcement is also the latest example of Scout Motors’ arrival driving additional investment and job creation across our state, bringing even more opportunities and prosperity for our people,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a statement.
“South Carolina’s strong reputation as an automotive powerhouse continues attracting investments from global companies,” Commerce Secretary Harry Lightsey added.
Portugal-headquartered Sodecia specializes in manufacturing structural parts for vehicles and powertrain systems. It has more than 40 locations across Europe, North and South America, and Asia.
Thailand-based Aapico has spent the last three decades making various plastic and metal car parts.
To bring the partners to South Carolina, the state approved Sodecia and Aapico for corporate income tax breaks worth $25,000 for each job created.
Orangeburg County Council Chairman Johnnie Wright said those jobs mean “real opportunity for the people who live and work here.”
The council approved the operation for a reduced property tax rate. The county did not provide any details publicly about the incentives it offered.

Free.,Trump administration threatens to yank food stamps funding from Democratic-led states,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-threatens-yank-food-stamps-funding-democratic-led-states,,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture will begin next week to block nutrition assistance funding for states led by Democrats that have not provided data on fraud in the program, Secretary Brooke Rollins told President Donald Trump at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday.USDA sought data from states earlier this year related to their administration of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits, Rollins said Tuesday. She added the data was needed to address fraud that she called “rampant” in the program that helps 42 million people afford groceries.Most states complied with the request, but 21, mostly run by Democrats, refused, she said. A USDA spokesperson later implied the department was missing data from 22 states.“As of next week, we have begun and will begin to stop moving federal funds into those states until they comply, and they tell us and allow us to partner with them to root out this fraud and to protect the American taxpayer,” Rollins said.A USDA spokesperson in an email listed 28 states, plus one territory, from which they said the department has received data.That would leave the following 22 states, all led by Democratic governors, that have not provided data: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin. The spokesperson provided some additional details of the initiative, including that the department was targeting administrative funds, and that the next step would be a formal warning.Blue states sought to protect bad actors, including criminals and immigrants in the country without legal status, “over the American taxpayer,” the statement said.“We have sent Democrat States yet another request for data, and if they fail to comply, they will be provided with formal warning that USDA will pull their administrative funds,” the spokesperson said.Court records show the department sent the states a new request for data on Nov. 28, and asked for a response within seven days, which would be Friday. The letter was reproduced as part of a suit the 22 states have brought against the administration over the request for SNAP recipients’ data.Leading Dem calls threat illegalIt’s unclear what authority Rollins would have to block funding, which Congress has appropriated.The federal government pays for all benefits for SNAP, which was formerly known as food stamps. It splits the administrative costs with states.The USDA spokesperson did not answer a direct question about the legal authority for withholding funds.Democrats on the U.S. House Agriculture Committee said any effort to block SNAP funding would be illegal.“Yet again, Trump and Rollins are illegally threatening to withhold federal dollars,” a social media post from an official account of committee Democrats read. “SNAP has one of the lowest fraud rates of any government program, but Trump continues to weaponize hunger.”The committee’s lead Democrat, Angie Craig of Minnesota, issued her own statement that also accused the administration of “weaponizing hunger” and said Rollins “continues to spew propaganda.”“Her disregard for the law and willingness to lie through her teeth comes from the very top – the Trump administration is as corrupt as it is lawless, and I will not sit silently as she carries out the president’s campaign against Americans struggling to afford food in part because of this president’s tariffs and disastrous economic policies.”  SNAP fraudThe data USDA has sought from states includes verification of SNAP recipients’ eligibility, along with a host of personal information such as Social Security numbers.An early USDA review of data provided by the 28 states and Guam “indicates an estimated average of $24 million dollars per day of federal funds is lost to fraud and errors undetected by States in their administration of SNAP,” the department said in the Nov. 28 letter.Preventing those losses could save up to $9 billion per year, the letter added.But the types of fraud cited in some of the public statements from Rollins and the department are rare, existing data show.A 2023 USDA report showed about 26,000 applications, roughly 0.1% of the households enrolled in SNAP, were referred for an administrative or criminal review.People in the country illegally have never been authorized to receive SNAP benefits.“The long-standing data sources indicate that intentional fraud by participants is rare,” Katie Bergh, a senior food assistance policy analyst for the left-leaning think tank Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, said in a November interview.Trump administration targetSNAP has been a consistent target for cuts during Trump’s second presidency.The issue was a focal point during the six-week government shutdown, during which the administration reversed itself often but generally resisted calls — from states, advocates, lawmakers and federal judges — to fund food assistance.Shortly after the government reopened, Rollins in television interviews said she would force all recipients to reapply for benefits, a proposal seen as logistically challenging by program experts.And the Republican taxes and spending law passed by Congress and signed by Trump earlier this year included new work requirements and other restrictions on SNAP eligibility that advocates say will lead to major drops in benefits. The law will also make states pay for some share of benefits and increase the share of administrative costs that states are responsible for, potentially leading some states to cut benefits.",,,,2025-12-02 16:57:18.978017

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The New York Times reported Tuesday morning that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is launching an “intensive immigration enforcement operation primarily targeting hundreds of undocumented Somali immigrants in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region.”
The report cites an anonymous Trump administration official and documents obtained by the Times. 
The plan calls for the deployment of “strike teams” comprising ICE officers and other federal officials. The anonymous official told the Times that roughly 100 officers and agents from around the country have been brought into the operation. 
Local elected officials tried to project resolve and support. 
“I know many families are fearful tonight, but I want you to know that the city and I stand behind you,” said Minneapolis Council Member Jamal Osman, who represents the largest East African community in the city, during a press conference Tuesday. 
The news comes after an increase in anti-Somali rhetoric among right-wing leaders, including President Donald Trump, following the publication of an article claiming — with little evidence — that Somali-American immigrants accused of defrauding Minnesota’s public programs are providing the money to the terrorist group al-Shaabab. 
Federal officials have investigated fraud in Minnesota’s public programs for years, and of the dozens of people charged so far, the majority are Somali-American. Terrorism financing has not been among the fraud-related charges.
“They contribute nothing. I don’t want them in our country,” Trump said during Tuesday’s cabinet meeting.
Data on the immigration statuses of the roughly 90,000 Somali-Americans in Minnesota is not readily available, but the vast majority of Somali people in Minnesota have legal status, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Tuesday. Roughly half of Somali-Americans in Minnesota were born in Somalia, according to 2024 Census data.
Frey and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter stood together at Tuesday’s press conference, decrying the president’s comments.

“Mistakes will be made — and let’s be clear — it means that American citizens will be detained for no other reason than the fact that they look like they are Somali,” Frey said. 
Protestors have squared off with federal officers — and sometimes local police — at raids in Minneapolis and St. Paul this year. Law enforcement officers have used crowd dispersal tactics like pepper spray, tear gas, rubber bullets and sound cannons. 
Both Minneapolis and St. Paul are sanctuary cities, meaning their local police do not question residents’ immigration status or enforce immigration law, which is a federal responsibility. But both police departments have helped immigration authorities control the large crowds of protesters that have convened outside of raids. 
Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Tuesday his officers will protect demonstrators’ First Amendment rights, and that the department is rewriting its immigration enforcement policy based on feedback from community organizations. 
“I also ask that if demonstrations do happen around any type of immigration raid, that they remain nonviolent — so that we can keep everyone in our community safe, so that we minimize the risk of any tragedy happening, or the immigrant communities that are already suffering to suffer that much more,” O’Hara said.
On Nov. 21, Trump posted on Truth Social that he was “terminating” Temporary Protected Status for Somali people in Minnesota. TPS protects citizens of certain countries — those that are deemed too dangerous or unstable — from deportation. Around 700 Somali citizens in the U.S. are protected by TPS. 
On Wednesday, the president directed immigration authorities to reexamine the green cards — granted to people with legal permanent residency — of people from “countries of concern,” including Somalia.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MG_8231-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 16:57:18.978017

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)
Members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation said in a letter Tuesday that the United States Agriculture Department must issue a “full and immediate” reimbursement to the state of New Mexico for $30 million it spent in November to pay for food assistance.
In mid-October during the federal government shutdown, the USDA informed states it would not provide SNAP funding to roughly 42 million Americans who rely on it, including about 460,000 New Mexicans. 
Later that month, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and legislative Democratic leaders announced they would use state funds to pay $30 million to cover 10 days’ worth of SNAP. The money came from the state’s Appropriation Contingency Fund, which the governor can draw from unilaterally to pay for emergencies. 
On Tuesday afternoon, all five members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation wrote to USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought saying that the federal government should pay New Mexico back.
NM SNAP benefits for November threatened due to shutdown, HCA secretary says

“New Mexico’s governor did what the administration would not: She kept children, seniors, and people with disabilities fed,” the delegation, all Democrats, wrote. “No state should have to raid their own budgets to fix a problem the administration created.”
The letter cites the funding bill that reopened the government. It authorizes federal agencies to reimburse states that used their own funds to cover programs “that would have been paid” during the shutdown, according to the letter. 
“The directive is unambiguous: USDA and OMB are required to repay states in full,” the delegation wrote. “We therefore expect USDA and OMB to move quickly to restore New Mexico’s funds and execute the reimbursement without delay. The federal government has a duty to make New Mexico whole, and we insist that responsibility be met immediately.”
New Mexico Legislature passes, acting governor signs $162.5M to cover SNAP payments if needed

The USDA, in guidance to states in late October, said it would not pay states back for any funding they use to pay for SNAP benefits, saying, “There is no provision or allowance under current law for states to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed.” 
A spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez told Source New Mexico in an email on Tuesday that the memo was taken as indication that states would not be reimbursed. And Vasquez, in a statement, said the administration has “acted recklessly and in bad faith with states like New Mexico.”
“Now that the federal government’s lights are back on, we’re asking the administration to do the right thing by New Mexico taxpayers and give the state back the money that it is rightfully owed,” Vasquez told Source. 
In addition to the $30 million the state paid for partial November benefits, the Legislature convened Nov. 11 to approve an additional $162.5 million in SNAP funding meant to last recipients until mid-January, when the Legislature will convene for its regular legislative session. That money ended up being unnecessary when the government reopened and SNAP funds resumed flowing.
“No state should be forced to backfill federal programs,” the delegation wrote. “New Mexico acted responsibly under extraordinary circumstances, and it must not bear the long-term financial burden for failures at the federal level.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Snap-booth-at-Growers-Market-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 16:57:18.978017

Officers find “warfare” notes, body armor, and an illegal conversion device after a late-night park encounter
WILMINGTON, Del. — A routine late-night patrol check in a Wilmington park may have stopped a planned attack on the University of Delaware Police Department, after officers arrested a 25-year-old man found with a converted handgun, body armor, and a notebook outlining assault tactics and a police station diagram, authorities said Tuesday.
New Castle County police said B-Squad patrol officers were checking Canby Park West around 11:47 p.m. Nov. 24 when they spotted a white Toyota Tacoma parked in the park after hours. When officers initiated a traffic stop, they contacted the driver and sole occupant, identified as Luqmaan Khan, 25, of Wilmington.
Officers developed probable cause to order Khan out of the vehicle, but he refused and resisted arrest before being taken into custody, police said. A search of the truck uncovered a loaded .357 Glock handgun inserted into a micro conversion kit, four loaded 27-round extended magazines, a ballistic hard plate used as body armor, binoculars, a laptop and a composition notebook.
The vehicle was towed to New Castle County Police Headquarters, where detectives obtained a search warrant. Inside the notebook, investigators later found handwritten notes on “warfare” techniques, premeditated assault plans and a diagram labeled as the University of Delaware Police Department, including a reference to a UD police officer by name, according to a federal criminal complaint filed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware.
The next day, Nov. 25, county detectives and FBI agents searched Khan’s Wilmington residence. There, authorities recovered a Glock 19 handgun equipped with an illegal machinegun conversion device, commonly called a “switch,” a .556 rifle with a scope and red-dot sight, 11 additional extended magazines, hollow-point ammunition, and a tactical vest with ballistic plates, federal prosecutors said. Department of Justice
New Castle County police initially charged Khan with felony possession of a large-capacity magazine, felony carrying a concealed deadly weapon, misdemeanor resisting arrest and several traffic and ordinance violations, including failure to have insurance in possession, expired tags and being in a county park after dark. His bail was set at $107,200 cash, and he was committed to jail before being turned over to the FBI for additional federal charges according to New Castle County Police.
The federal complaint charges Khan with illegal possession of a machine gun, a felony that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison if convicted. A federal judge will determine any sentence under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. Khan is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in court/
Acting U.S. Attorney Julianne Murray called the case a clear example of state and federal agencies working together to “neutralize a grave threat” before anyone was harmed, praising patrol officers and federal agents for moving quickly once the threat became clear.
FBI Baltimore Special Agent in Charge Jimmy Paul similarly credited the patrol officers for their initial actions, saying the Wilmington Resident Agency remains focused on disrupting individuals “who seek to commit acts of violence,” including against law enforcement. New Castle County Police Col. James Leonard said the officers’ proactive work prevented a potential tragedy and underscored the value of visible patrols and firm enforcement of existing laws.
The University of Delaware was notified of the findings, and the FBI’s Wilmington office is continuing the investigation. Officials did not announce any specific changes to campus security but said law enforcement will remain vigilant.
For many residents and law-and-order advocates, the incident is likely to reinforce calls for strong support of front-line policing, tough scrutiny of illegal firearms and full prosecution of those who target law enforcement — while also highlighting that, in this case, basic patrol work and existing gun laws were enough to take a heavily armed suspect off the street before a plan on paper could turn into an attack.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Threat-to-UD-Police.png,,,2025-12-02 15:58:57.102764

(Photo provided by University of Kentucky)The University of Kentucky Board of Trustees has accepted the largest donation in school history — $150 million from The Bill Gatton Foundation — to create a new arts district on campus.
However, some approval is still needed from the state legislature to move the project forward. 
The funds accepted Tuesday will support a new arts district on the western edge of the Lexington campus. It will include a new College of Fine Arts building along South Broadway, near the Gray Design Building, as well as a performance theater for dance, music and theater with several hundred seats. A pavilion and connecting park will link South Broadway and Bolivar Street near the university’s School of Art and Visual Studies (SA/VS) Building. 
“This gift will realize a vision to create an arts district on the western edge of our campus,” UK President Eli Capilouto said in a press release. “There, we can integrate art into an area of Lexington that is an increasingly vibrant and vital intersection of campus and city, town and gown.”
Gatton, who died in 2022, was an alumnus of UK. His previous gifts to the university total more than $200 million and have supported programs such as the Martin-Gatton College of Agriculture, Food and Environment; the Gatton College of Business and Economics, and the Gatton Student Center. 
Capilouto said in the press release that construction for the new arts district would require authorization from the Kentucky General Assembly to issue bonds. Discussions with legislative leaders are underway. The state legislature returns to Frankfort in January to convene for the 2026 session. 
Some Kentucky elected officials praised the donation in the university’s press release. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said the gift “will help not only the university but also Lexington and Kentucky, as it creates a vibrant, welcoming arts district for students, Kentuckians and visitors to enjoy.”
“Education and the arts fuel our economy and our workforce, and investments like these are how we keep working to build a bright future for generations,” Beshear said. 
Republicans Senate President Robert Stivers, of Manchester, and House Speaker David Osborne, of Prospect, applauded the donation. 
“I’m anxious to authorize bonds so that construction can begin quickly,” Stivers said. “This expansion may be the impetus for more students pursuing a fine arts degree and perhaps working in the film industry, a growing industry made possible by Senate Bill 1 of the 2025 session.”
Osborne said Gatton’s “extraordinary generosity has transformed lives across Kentucky, and today’s historic gift continues that legacy.”
“His vision for education, community and the arts reflects the very best of our Commonwealth’s values,” Osborne said. “It celebrates our incredible heritage and makes way for an even more promising future. This arts district will not only enrich the University of Kentucky, but will also strengthen Lexington and our entire state.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Proposed-Preliminary-Rendering-by-SASKI-RATIO_1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-02 15:58:57.102764

The funding comes from the Long Island Sound Futures Fund, a partnership between the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other state and federal agencies. Grants from the fund are awarded annually, and come from a mixture of public and private sources.
Long Island Sound is the second largest estuary on the East Coast, stretching over nearly 1,200 square miles between New York and Connecticut. Its watershed, including the Connecticut River, also covers parts of three other states: Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont.
Recipients in Connecticut were awarded a dozen grants totaling $3.6 million from the Futures Fund. Combined with matching funds and other grants shared with other states, the total amount of those projects rose to $7 million.
“Joining together to invest in a stronger, healthier Long Island Sound is essential, both for the region’s environmental quality and to enhance quality of life for the millions of people who live, work and play on and near the Sound,” said Emma Cimino, the deputy commissioner for environmental quality at the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
The announcement of this year’s awards also comes as the EPA has sought to slash both staff and funding for its efforts across the U.S., while also rolling back regulations designed to reduce air and water pollution.
In June, the EPA closed its Long Island Sound Office in Stamford and moved the remaining employees to the agency’s regional offices in New York City. No staffers were terminated as a result of the move, a spokesperson said at the time, but at least one employee accepted a deferred resignation offer from the Trump administration.
The EPA did not respond to questions Tuesday about how the closure of the Stamford office had impacted the Futures Fund or the agency’s other efforts on the Sound. 
Bill Lucey, of the nonprofit group Save the Sound, said the move has given advocates less face to face interaction with officials at the EPA but has not otherwise impacted the work of the agency’s Long Island Sound program.
Overall funding for the EPA program has grown to $40 million in the most recent fiscal year, up from just $1 million a decade ago.
“It was underfunded for several years, but as soon as that funding was increased, a lot more people got involved in future projects, and a lot of great work is being done all up and down the coastline, on the marshes and shorelines and in the rivers,” Lucey said.
Among the recipients of the Futures Fund grants is the Maritime Aquarium in Norwalk, which was awarded $537,300 to fund an ongoing effort to remove lost and abandoned lobster traps from the floor of the Sound. The total cost of that project, including matching funds, was $809,900.
Three organizations — including the Norwalk River Watershed Association, Save the Sound and American Rivers — were awarded a total of nearly $1.4 million to develop and obtain permits for the restoration of fish passages along the Norwalk, Quinnipiac, Fourmile and Branford rivers. The total cost of those projects was over $2.6 million.
Several other grants awarded to Connecticut organizations. The total project costs are included in parenthesis.

(Photo courtesy of Washington State School for the Blind)When the longtime superintendent of the Washington State School for the Blind resigned this summer, he blamed harassment from a former employee.
An investigative report, obtained via public records request, concluded Scott McCallum himself sexually harassed a female colleague during his final years on the job.
The investigation, completed in mid-May, found McCallum hugged a female coworker and softly said in her ear twice that “you look good.” She reported feeling sick and losing sleep after the 2024 incident.
McCallum confirmed to investigators that he’d hugged the woman, saying he hardly recognized her because she’d lost weight. He said his comment about her looks was not sexual.
In an earlier incident, McCallum was accused of showing a woman a picture of his buttocks while flipping through his phone’s camera roll during a school award ceremony. McCallum said it was unintentional, calling the moment embarrassing. He said the photo was taken to show sores from his new rowing machine. It wasn’t clear from the report if this was the same woman from the hugging incident.

McCallum, who’d led the school since 2016, was also accused of running the school as a “dictatorship,” but the inquiry didn’t back that up. 
He couldn’t be reached for comment.
In his Aug. 1 resignation letter to Gov. Bob Ferguson, McCallum described “continuous harassment from a former employee that has created significant disruption across the agency.”
“I remain hopeful that such disruption and threats may cease once I depart my role as superintendent,” he wrote. He added that he believed it was the right time for a shift in leadership at the school and said he would seek new professional opportunities.
Ferguson reappointed McCallum to the position in January. 
McCallum has a national reputation in the education of students who are blind or visually impaired. He helped implement the country’s first online adaptive state assessment that is accessible to students who read Braille.
In 2022, the National Federation of the Blind awarded him the Distinguished Educator of Blind Students award.
Ferguson’s office declined to comment on McCallum’s departure. The governor appointed Pam Parker, the school’s outreach director, to serve as interim superintendent for the 2025-26 school year.
The school serves blind, visually-impaired and deaf-blind students. Fifty students were enrolled this past school year, according to state data. It has about 100 full-time equivalent employees and a state budget of around $29 million.
Before being recruited to come to Washington, McCallum worked in education in Oregon, including when the state closed its own school for blind students. He led Oregon’s implementation of increased state funding for support services for blind children that replaced the school, he said when accepting the award in 2022.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wa-school-of-the-blind-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 15:58:57.102764

(Alabama Department of Archives and History)Ann Bedsole, the first woman elected to the Alabama Senate and the first Republican woman elected to the Alabama House of Representatives, has died. She was 95 years old.
The Alabama Republican Party announced Bedsole’s death Tuesday. A cause of death was not immediately available.
“Ann Bedsole opened doors that had never been opened for women in Alabama politics,” Joan Reynolds, the vice chairwoman of the Alabama Republican Party, said in a statement. “She broke barriers with grace, courage, and conviction, and she did it at a time when few women were ever given the opportunity.”

Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, said in a statement Tuesday that Bedsole was “a woman of many firsts.”
“All who served with her say she was a larger than life personality who made the Legislature better with her simple presence,” the statement said. “Sen. Bedsole packed many adventures into her 95 years, and I join countless Republicans across the state in keeping her family in our prayers.”
A list of survivors was not immediately available Tuesday.
Bedsole served for 16 years in the Alabama Legislature, including one term in the House and three in the Senate. A cattle farmer and timberland owner, she had been active in Republican Party politics in Mobile and broader civic activities, particularly historic preservation.  That work, Bedsole said, helped her understand the importance of politics.
“When you work real hard to get something accomplished that’s right for the community, you always come back to the fact it happens in Montgomery or Washington,” he said.
Bedsole ran for the Alabama House of Representatives in 1978 as a Republican in a district in west Mobile County, after the previous occupant, Sonny Callahan – later a congressman –- ran for a Senate seat. Bedsole told The Birmingham News in 1992 that she waited for her eldest child to enter senior year of high school before running.
“It’s a hard job, and very time-consuming,” she said. “So it makes it extremely difficult for someone trying to do a good job of raising children to serve in the Legislature. It doesn’t seem to bother men, but men aren’t the care-givers, and that’s one of the differences.”
After winning election, Bedsole was one of only three women — and one of only four Republicans — serving in the House. She later said that the women “had a hard time being taken seriously.”
“We weren’t mistreated or anything like that,” she said. “The House leadership gave us the opportunity to be effective and do a good job. But they looked with a jaundiced eye for a year to see if the women could handle it.”
The representative served on the education budget committee during her time in the House. When Callahan left his Senate seat in 1982, Bedsole won election to the chamber, where she served from 1983 to 1994.
During her time, Bedsole sponsored legislation that established the Alabama School of Mathematics and Science in Mobile in 1989. Bedsole, who enjoyed backing from business interests, voted to limit damage awards from liability lawsuits and voted against an education reform package in 1992 amid concerns its tax burdens would fall hardest on middle-class households. She also supported teacher tenure laws.
The senator also broadly supported abortion rights, though she approved parental consent laws. Bedsole also campaigned for years to ban PAC-to-PAC transfers, a way of concealing the identity of donors to a campaign. The Legislature did not ban the practice until 2010.
Bedsole often lamented the absence of women in the 140-member Alabama Legislature. “Women’s views are not heard in the Legislature when there are only eight women in the whole thing,” she told the Birmingham News in 1992.
Bedsole ran for governor in 1994. During the campaign, she called for a repeal of the grocery tax, a constitutional convention, judicial reform and stronger ethics laws. Bedsole had hoped that business support would help her in her campaign against former Gov. Fob James — who entered the Republican primary hours before qualifying — but many cast their ballots in what became a fierce battle for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor between former Attorney General Don Siegelman and Sen. Ryan deGraffenreid.
James won the nomination and narrowly defeated Gov. Jim Folsom Jr., a Democrat, in the general election that year.
“I guess it proves you can’t do it in Alabama without help from special interests,” Bedsole said after the loss.
After losing the election, Bedsole focused on business and philanthropy, and mounted an unsuccessful campaign for mayor of Mobile in 2005.
Outside the Legislature, Bedsole was an active gardener and scuba diver.
“The water’s cold when you first go in and I think ‘Ahh, I don’t think I can do this,’” she told the Birmingham News in 1994. “And then I put the mask on, stick the regulator in my mouth and look down and I cannot wait to get down. It’s just a wonderful, gorgeous new world.”
Asked if she had the same feeling in the Senate, Bedsole said “it’s sort of an opposite feeling, not quite as peaceful.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ann-Bedsole-for-Dec-2-2025-story.png,,,2025-12-02 15:58:57.102764

Bob Dole, a Kansas Republican who died in 2021, was among a minority of federal lawmakers who seek to repeal the Electoral College and elect presidents by national popular vote. In this news release archived by the Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas, Dole uses humor and history to summarize his critique of the Electoral College. (Dole Archives, University of Kansas)TOPEKA — The late U.S. Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas supported a constitutional amendment abandoning the Electoral College in the election of U.S. presidents and implementing a process of choosing the nation’s chief executive by national popular vote.
In 1979, Dole was frustrated by the U.S. Senate’s deflection of an amendment that would have shifted the process to direct election of presidents. In his unsuccessful campaign for reform, Dole pointed out the 1976 presidential race could have resulted in an Electoral College victory for Republican Gerald Ford and defeat for Democrat Jimmy Carter with a shift of fewer than 10,000 votes in key states. That would have occurred despite Carter’s overall 1.7 million vote plurality.
“I believe it would have been viewed as a betrayal of the American system of democracy,” said Dole, who was Ford’s vice presidential running mate. “Direct election would prevent this potential nightmare from occurring.”
So far, the outcome feared by Dole occurred five times in U.S. history — three times in the 1800s and twice in the past 25 years.
Despite Dole’s belief the presidential candidate who received the largest number of popular votes should win the presidential election, the Electoral College has persisted. The staying power of the Electoral College was a point of contention during a recent debate at the Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas. During a trial-like forum, attorneys delivered opposing arguments on the topic and presented expert witnesses to bolster their cases.
 
Bubba vs. socialists
Ed Duckers, a partner in a California law firm and KU graduate, said repeal of the Electoral College would distort contests for president, and vice president, by abandoning a system that compelled candidates to seek broad appeal across the United States.
Direct election would trigger an avalanche of presidential aspirants anchored to a relatively small number of urban centers harboring millions of votes while sparsely populated states would mostly be ignored, he said.
“It’s going to lead to more polarizing and extreme candidates where the Republicans are about nothing but Texas and Bubba in the South and the Democrats are about nothing but (New York City Mayor-elect) Zohran (Mamdani) and socialists in the Northeast and California,” Duckers said.
He asserted liberals were keen to topple the Electoral College because in 2000 Democrat Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College to Republican George W. Bush. In 2016, the same occurred when Republican Donald Trump lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Both outcomes produced protracted turmoil in the United States.
“Why? Why? Why?” Duckers said. “Well, the why is because their team lost in 2000 and then lost in 2016. That is not a good reason to throw this country into turmoil by changing the way we elect presidents.”
The process of declaring a winner in a U.S. presidential race requires state-by-state popular elections among presidential candidates every four years. The states and the District of Columbia convert those results into electoral votes. There are a total of 538 votes in the Electoral College, and a 270-vote majority secures victory. Each state’s winning candidate can expect to claim all of that state’s electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska.
Pedro Irigonegaray, a Kansas trial attorney for more than 50 years, said the Electoral College should be repealed and replaced by a direct election. He said the Electoral College was flawed when adopted by the Constitutional Convention in 1787. The approach wasn’t the result of farsighted political design or anchored to constitutional theory, he said.
He said it was the product of demands by slave-owning states for more influence in elections by counting slaves as three-fifths of a person when allocating electors in the Electoral College.
“They didn’t want anyone else to vote except white men who were landowners,” Irigonegaray said. “The Electoral College is antiquated. It doesn’t work.”
He said the Electoral College undermined majority rule and depressed voter turnout in states solidly Republican or Democratic as candidates focused on the handful of swing states.
“I trust the American people. I value their intelligence. I value their vote,” Irigonegaray said. “This is not Republicans versus Democrats. This is about the American value for the right to vote.”
 
‘It can be dangerous’
Linsey Moddelmog, a professor of political science at Washburn University in Topeka, said polling indicated a majority of Republicans and Democrats supported abolition of the Electoral College. Repeal of the Electoral College made sense because the system was “not democratic,” she said.
“No other presidential system in the world uses an Electoral College,” she said. “It can be dangerous. Elections need to have clear and authentic and legitimate results.”
Moddelmog said there was risk presidential candidates would call upon supporters to rebel if the Electoral College didn’t go their way. She said the evidence was response to Trump’s reelection loss in 2020, including the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. A mob of Trump supporters broke through security personnel and entered the building in an attempt to prevent a joint session of Congress from counting Electoral College votes to affirm election of Democrat Joe Biden.
During cross-examination by Duckers, Moddelmog said she wasn’t concerned a move to the popular vote would incentivize billionaires to derail the democratic process by intensifying funding to third-party or independent candidates.
“I do believe that there are third-party candidates that would run. What I don’t believe is that they will ruin elections,” she said.
Jeff Jackson, dean of the Washburn University law school, said framers of the U.S. Constitution arrived at the Electoral College by default because all other ideas were rejected. They settled on creation of a deliberative body of people chosen by states to determine the president, he said.
“What they couldn’t foresee was the rise of political parties and they couldn’t foresee the fact that Americans wanted to vote,” he said.
Subsequent reforms opened voting to former slaves as well as women. The United States eliminated poll taxes disadvantaging those not owning land and the voting age was lowered. Federal civil rights laws regarding voting were enforced.
But, Jackson said, that wasn’t sufficient to correct festering wounds of the Electoral College.
“The problem is all of these Band-Aids are still hobbled by the fact that we have the Electoral College, which means as long as the Electoral College exists some people’s votes are always going to count more than others,” Jackson said.
 
Save the Electoral College
Trent England, executive director of Save Our States, an organization originally dedicated to preserving the Electoral College but expanded to lobby on state and federal policy on health care, foreign threats as well as diversity, equity and inclusion. He’s affiliated with the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, which was founded by a chairman of the Heritage Foundation.
He said he launched Save Our States because “there needed to be a principled, historically grounded defense of the Electoral College.”
“The founders really focused on the fact that what matters about an election system is more than just how we feel about it or whether our side is winning. What matters is, over time, how does it shape your politics, right?” he said.
England said a national popular election for president would inevitably be managed by the federal government, which he would oppose because that function should be left to states. Presidential contests would be nothing more than popularity contests that rewarded people for rallying their core constituency rather than securing bipartisan alliances, he said.
“The Electoral College forces candidates who want to win the presidency to build the truly nationwide coalition and to have much more legitimacy,” he said.
He said Trump was able to go 2-1 in presidential campaigns because he was able to win over voters who were unmoved by Republican presidential nominees John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012.
Tara Ross, author of the 2019 book “Why We Need the Electoral College,” said the Electoral College had proven its worth for more than 200 years.
“The Electoral College should be kept. The Electoral College is not partisan. It serves our country,” she said.
During cross-examination of Ross, Irigonegaray asked her about her volunteer work for Save Our States, which he said characterized DEI as a bad idea that advanced policies harmful to the economy, divided the nation and violated laws. Irigonegaray’s question centered on the nation’s long history of placing barriers in front of qualified women and minorities.
“I think we should judge people based on merit,” Cross said. “I’d rather have a color-blind society.”
“What if as a result of bigotry and ignorance, those individuals and minorities have not been provided, historically, the benefits that they deserve?” Irigonegaray said.
Ross: “I think this is kind of racist, to be honest, to say that people cannot achieve things because of the color of the skin.”
“I didn’t say that,” Irigonegaray said. “What I said was, as a consequence of bigotry, ignorance and abuse, many qualified women, Black men, Black women and minorities have been denied the prerequisite merit, talent and intelligence to perform work.”
Ross’ rebuttal: “Are we talking about this because you can’t actually ask me a question about the Electoral College that will stump me?”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dole-electoral-college-3-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-02 15:58:57.102764

I figured I had the right place when I saw the bumper sticker for David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who nearly became Louisiana’s governor. I knew I had the right place when I saw a Confederate battle flag flapping in the breeze outside a white wooden-frame house.
As I stepped down the gravel driveway, a wiry 5-foot-8 man hailed me. I shook the hand of the 69-year-old, surprised by his steady grip. As I let go, I realized it was the same hand that squeezed the trigger of the .30-06 rifle that killed Medgar Evers in 1963.
Byron De La Beckwith waved me inside his home in Signal Mountain, Tennessee, and guided me into a back room, where he sat in a floral chair, holding court. An orphan by age 12, he had fought in the Pacific during World War II and returned to Mississippi with a Purple Heart. Eager to belong, he joined the Sons of the American Revolution, where he told me members began telling him “the horrible, insidiously evil things that went on in local, county, state, federal and worldwide government.”

Beckwith and his wife belonged to the far-right Liberty Lobby. Through its newspaper, The Spotlight, the organization claimed that fraud enabled “illegal aliens” to stay in the U.S. and that 6 million Jews didn’t die in the Holocaust because only 74,000 died at Auschwitz. (Historians put the actual Auschwitz figure at 1.1 million deaths, nearly all of them Jews.)
Spotlight, whose readership reached up to 1 million, pushed the agenda that secret sinister forces controlled the government, seeking to harm Americans through drinking water, prescription drugs and conventional medical treatment, including vaccines, despite the role vaccines have played in the global eradication of smallpox and the near eradication of polio. A recent study concluded that immunizations had saved more than 150 million lives.
Now, decades since my 1990 interview with Beckwith, what was once fringe thinking has become fashionable. Anti-science, anti-vaccine, anti-immigrant and anti-federal government rhetoric have made their way into the mainstream.
In 1998, The Lancet published a landmark study by Andrew Wakefield and other scientists about a possible link between vaccines and autism.
Although the British medical journal later retracted this study, mistrust mushroomed. Celebrities from Jim Carrey to Robert De Niro questioned the safety of childhood vaccines. They found a supporter in Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now the nation’s Health and Human Services secretary. In the wake of parents refusing to vaccinate their children, measles — virtually eradicated in the 2000s — has roared back to about 1,800 cases so far this year, resulting in at least three deaths, two of them children.
After the pandemic hit in 2020, Kennedy said in a video that “COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese. We don’t know if it was deliberately targeted or not.” He called the COVID vaccine — developed during President Donald Trump’s first administration and backed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — “the deadliest vaccine ever made.”
On Aug. 8 this year, a man angry about the vaccine fired hundreds of rounds at the CDC headquarters, killing a police officer before he committed suicide.
Inside Beckwith’s home in 1990, his wife, Thelma, brought him a glass of an orange drink. I noticed it was bubbling like a mad scientist’s potion. I asked him about it, and he explained it was orange soda, combined with food-grade hydrogen peroxide.
This, he told me, was part of his chelation therapy, which he insisted had kept his arteries clear since renal surgery. Chelation — a dubious treatment that Spotlight championed — grabs poisons and expels them through the kidneys, Beckwith said. “Right-wing folks all over the country are drinking hydrogen peroxide,” he said.
While chelation is used to treat lead poisoning, the medical community has rejected broader use. But that hasn’t stopped Kennedy from touting chelation. Celebrity Jenny McCarthy claims chelation cured her son of autism, but at least one child has died from this treatment.
Beckwith’s wife poured me a glass of this orange concoction, and I pretended to sip it. He promised me it would remove the poisons that the government had been pumping into my body through fluoridated water. “Fluoridated water has been killing babies,” he said. “It’s being suppressed by the government and national TV.”
For decades, the CDC praised fluoridated water, saying studies show the treatment reduces cavities. Despite that, Utah and Florida recently banned fluoride in public water systems. At least 16 other states have introduced bills to do the same. Mississippi has, too, despite the fact that much of the state’s water supply contains no fluoride.
Since taking over as HHS secretary, Kennedy has called fluoride a “dangerous neurotoxin” that can cause bone fractures, bone cancer, arthritis, thyroid disorders and reduced IQ in children. The Environmental Protection Agency is now reviewing evidence on fluoride in drinking water.
Beckwith said the words that changed him most came from Judge Thomas P. Brady, who decried the Supreme Court’s 1954 decision to desegregate public schools in an infamous speech known as “Black Monday.” He told a bizarre racist version of history in which he claimed whites built the pyramids in Egypt and that racial “mongrelization” had destroyed this society. This was nothing more than a desire by white supremacists to believe they were behind the world’s greatest achievements. In reality, these ancient civilizations were anything but white.
Brady said people of African descent should regard the day they arrived in America in 1619 as “Thanksgiving Day” because they were “brought from abject ignorance, primitive slavery and placed in a country that was Christian and civilized.” White Mississippi students read this speech in their classrooms along with textbooks that claimed the KKK had saved the South. These same textbooks failed to mention the savage massacres of Black Mississippians from Vicksburg to Meridian.
In recent years, attacks on “critical race theory” and diversity, equity and inclusion have led to revised textbooks. In Florida, new standards require textbooks to say “slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.” Some textbooks now call slavery “black immigration,” and one book describes Reconstruction as a time when “great southern leaders and much of the old aristocracy were unable to vote or hold office. The result was that state legislatures were filled with illiterate or incompetent men. … In retaliation, many southerners formed secret organizations to protect themselves and their society from anarchy. Among these groups was the Ku Klux Klan.”
In March, Trump issued an executive order that instructed the National Park Service to remove materials that “inappropriately disparage Americans.” The Washington Post reported that the administration has ordered the removal of signs and exhibits related to slavery at multiple national parks, including an 1863 photo used to expose slavery’s horrors — a Black man whose back was covered in scars.
After Brady gave his “Black Monday” speech, Beckwith sold copies of it and joined the white Citizens’ Council. He said the most powerful members of society — bank presidents, judges, lawyers, congressmen and other politicians — made up the council. “That was my first love,” he sighed, as if reminiscing about a high school sweetheart. “The Citizens’ Council was the first ray of light Dixie had seen since we fought through Reconstruction and captured the right to vote, the right of white people to run the South.”
He said there had been a “great awakening of council activity in St. Louis, but it’s under a little different name” — the Council of Conservative Citizens.
A quarter-century after Beckwith’s words, a young white man named Dylann Roof stumbled upon that group’s website in his Google search for “black on White crime.” After reading page after page of such violence, Roof took action.
On June 17, 2015, he walked inside the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in time for Wednesday night Bible study. While a dozen Black members closed their eyes in prayer, Roof fired 70 rounds from a Glock .45-caliber pistol, killing nine. When he recounted the slaughter to the FBI, he laughed.
Beckwith laughed, too, when he spoke about Medgar Evers. “I didn’t kill that n—, but he’s sho’ dead,” he chuckled. “He ain’t comin’ back.”
In 1964, two trials for Beckwith ended in mistrials. The all-white juries couldn’t agree on a verdict, despite the fact his rifle with his fingerprint had been left at the murder scene. But the Klansman failed to dodge conviction when he tried to bomb a Jewish leader’s home in New Orleans in 1975.
After spending two and a half years in prison, he joined the Liberty Lobby, which pushed for the deportation of all immigrants. Beckwith called those of Asian descent “the yellow plague” and said, “The Chinamen come over here and eat rice and dead rats, and all the money goes back to China.”
More than three decades later, these tropes persist. After a far-right outlet claimed Haitians, who migrated legally to Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets, then-Sen. JD Vance shared it on social media. City officials denied the report, but Trump repeated the claim in a 2024 presidential debate. He vowed to deport millions of immigrants, starting in Springfield.
In 2025 so far, more than 2 million undocumented immigrants have left the U.S. through deportations or other means, according to the Department of Homeland Security. In September, Trump announced that the fees to hire skilled foreign workers would rise from nearly $1,000 to $100,000.
Beckwith’s beloved Liberty Lobby advocated “America First,” a slogan adopted by the KKK in the 1920s in their opposition to Catholics, Jews and immigrants. The white supremacist group skyrocketed to more than 6 million members, electing thousands to state and national offices. In Mississippi, Klansman Theodore G. Bilbo served as both governor (1916-20 and 1928-32) and U.S. senator (1935-47).
Trump has since revived the slogan “America First,” and new Labor Department posters feature 1940s-era workers and families, promising “high-skilled jobs to AMERICANS FIRST.” All the workers are white men.
In a recent interview with conservative podcaster Tucker Carlson, Nick Fuentes, host of the “America First” livestream, decried “organized Jewry” and declared, “We need to recognize that white people have a special heritage here as Americans. … We’re losing our civilization because of mass immigration.” Trump should crush anyone in the way of deporting the 10 million people here illegally, Fuentes said. “If you’re not on board with that, you’re going to jail.”
The Liberty Lobby denounced foreign aid. After taking office in 2025, the Trump administration halted this aid, dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development and asked Congress to rescind $8.3 billion in funding.
Beckwith told me to thank the KKK. If the group didn’t exist, “you’d be a damn mulatto, quadroon or octoroon instead of a white man, a Nordic man of blood and culture. You’d just be a damn mongrel,” he said. He told me that Evers, the civil rights leader he had shot in the back on that dark night in Jackson, was “nothing but a mongrel, and God hates mongrels.”
Beckwith told me that our ancestors were the true Israelites and that “anyone who calls Jesus a Jew is blaspheming.” His basement was already packed with an arsenal for the “holy war” that he said white Christians would win against Satan and the Jews. “We have more firepower,” he said.
In 2017, hundreds of white nationalists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting, “Jews will not replace us.” On Aug. 27 of this year, a mass shooter opened fire at a Catholic school in Minneapolis. He wrote on his guns, “Burn Israel,” “6 million wasn’t enough,” and “Kill Donald Trump,” a strong supporter of Israel who has survived two assassination attempts.
Back in the 1950s, the Liberty Lobby joined forces with the white Citizens’ Council, trying to get Black Americans shipped to Africa. Beckwith supported this. He said he believed that those of African descent were “mud people” who had no souls. “What is a n— but a heathen?” he told me. “He’s not a Christian. After you turn him into a literate Christian, he’s still a n—.”
I felt overwhelmed, stunned that such a person could exist, let alone that he could be celebrated — and worse — protected by those in power. Noticing the darkness outside, I told him it was time for me to go.
“Let me walk you to your car.”
“That isn’t necessary.”
He walked ahead of me, anyway, blocked my way to the car and spoke. “God will bless you if you write positive things about white Caucasian Christians. If you write negative things about white Caucasian Christians, God will punish you.”
He paused, then locked eyes. “If God does not punish you directly, several individuals will do it for him.”
He stepped aside, and I closed the door. I was glad to have something, even just a pane of glass, between him and me.
I couldn’t start the engine fast enough.
Four years after my interview, a Mississippi jury convicted Beckwith of murdering Evers, and the judge sentenced him to life in prison, where he died in 2001. Hardly anyone attended his funeral.
Thousands flocked to the funeral service of Evers, who was buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. Words from the prophet Micah reminded author Margaret Walker Alexander of Evers: “And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.”

The Dallas County Medical Center in Fordyce is a 25-bed critical access hospital and the county’s largest employer, and it serves patients regardless of their ability to pay for care, according to the complaint dated Wednesday by CEO David Mantz. Since 2010, the hospital has participated in the federal 340B program, which requires pharmaceutical companies that participate in Medicaid to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices to clinics, community health centers and hospitals that primarily serve low-income patients.
340B saves the hospital $1.1 million annually, and the hospital cannot afford to pay for prescription drugs at market prices and maintain its current services, Mantz wrote in the complaint.
States force drugmakers to keep selling cheaper meds under federal program

The federal Health Resources and Services Administration announced earlier this year that it would launch a “340B rebate model pilot program” for ten widely prescribed drugs. The program will be effective Jan. 1 for nine of the drugs and April 1 for the remaining one.
The American Hospital Association, Maine Hospital Association and four hospitals, including the Dallas County one, are joint plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine. The defendants are HRSA, its administrator Thomas Engel, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the department, and the United States itself.
Requiring hospitals to pay market prices for drugs and seek reimbursement for the discounted difference by providing claims data to drug companies “would inflict hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of annual costs on hospitals and other covered entities,” according to the plaintiffs’ joint complaint.
“First, a rebate system would impose vast administrative costs to submit, track, recover, and potentially dispute the rebates,” the complaint states. “Second, it would drain 340B hospitals of huge sums of money through payments to drug companies that the hospitals then must wait to have refunded by those drug companies. Third, a rebate system would invite mischief from drug companies that have every incentive to slow and stymie the issuance of rebates, figuring that some number of rebates can be withheld from safety-net hospitals by throwing the proverbial ‘sand in the gears.’”
According to both complaints, drug companies have wanted HRSA to institute a 340B rebate program for years. Drugmakers have alleged in the past that some hospitals are pocketing the savings instead of investing the money in more services. Some research supports that contention.
Dallas County Medical Center has used its savings for a variety of patient services, Mantz wrote in the complaint. Those services include:

A financial assistance program for low-income patients
An outpatient psychiatric program for senior citizens
Several primary care outpatient clinics
A telehealth clinic for cancer patients, eliminating their need to drive multiple hours round trip to see a doctor
Replacing the hospital’s leaky roof this year without taking on debt


Mantz-Dallas County Declaration 
“We fear the increased costs from Defendants’ rebate program will force us to cut unprofitable service lines, such as our telehealth oncology clinic,” Mantz wrote. “Ultimately, the financial pressure from the rebate program could force DCMC to leave the 340B Program altogether.”
The hospital planned to use its 340B savings for more new services, such as a daycare center for employees’ children, a telehealth clinic in a local school, a wheelchair-accessible shower in the hospital, and more repairs and maintenance, Mantz wrote. The announcement of the rebate program forced the hospital to delay or cancel those plans.
Complying with the rebate program would require the Dallas County Medical Center to hire two new full-time employees “to track and chase rebates and monitor the impact on our operational budget,” but Jan. 1 is too soon for the employees to be hired and trained, Mantz wrote. Paying those employees would cut into the hospital’s budget.
Mantz said he has concerns about the rebate program itself, specifically the lack of “specific penalties” for improperly denied rebates and the use of a private-third party data collector with “unreasonable terms and conditions” and no guarantee to protect patients’ data.
The joint complaint criticizes the use of the term “pilot program” to describe it because it requires all 340B entities to participate or lose access to the program upon its implementation. The complaint also accuses HRSA of ignoring feedback from health care entities nationwide raising concerns about the administrative costs of the new program.
The plaintiffs seek a temporary restraining order before Jan. 1 preventing the rebate program from going into effect until the court makes a final judgment.
“Giving hospitals only a few months to comply with these burdensome new requirements or risk losing millions of dollars in discounts they are entitled to under the law will harm patients and communities across the country,” Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association, said in a news release. “We are asking the court to act quickly to protect access to vital care services.”

,Alaska Beacon,2025-12-02 20:06:40+00:00,Alaska Beacon,Alaska Supreme Court must stop judges from treating people with mental illness worse than criminals,Val Van Brocklin,,,,,https://alaskabeacon.com/2025/12/02/alaska-supreme-court-must-stop-judges-from-treating-people-with-mental-illness-worse-than-criminals/,"In Alaska, a criminal in custody must be presented with charges in court within 48 hours — or be freed.

It’s a constitutional due process right. But if you’re an Alaskan with mental illness who has committed no crime? Our courts let the state confine you for weeks with no determination of whether your custody is legal. 
That’s what happened in Tavis J. — an Alaska Supreme Court decision issued in October. It revealed superior court judges have persistently ordered these prolonged illegal confinements, rather than hold the legislative and executive branches accountable for a broken, unconstitutional system.  
As Nick Feronti, attorney for the Northern Justice Project, told me, “If this happened in the criminal context—for instance, if people were just held in prison without cause and additional scrutiny for longer than 48 hours — it would be absurd. It would be illegal.” 
The law governing Tavis’ confinement was clear. A person can be held in custody for a psychiatric evaluation when there’s probable cause to believe the person is “gravely disabled” as a  result of a mental illness and unable to meet their basic needs. A petition must be filed and granted by a superior court for an evaluation period that cannot exceed 72 hours. 
(There are also provisions for involuntarily confining persons who present a danger to others. Neither Tavis nor any of the other cases mentioned here involved any suspected danger to others.)
Over a decade ago, our state Supreme Court ruled the person must be transported “immediately” to an evaluation facility, and this can’t be delayed simply because facilities have no capacity.
The capacity issues of state-run facilities like the Alaska Psychiatric Institute have been well documented in media reports and court challenges, and individual Alaskans cannot be unlawfully confined while these institutional changes are addressed.  
Alaskans’ due process rights do not depend on adequate funding or what reforms are or are not being made. But the superior courts continued to let the state illegally confine these Alaskans.
So, in 2018 the Disability Law Center and Public Defender Agency sued the state for prolonged detentions in Alaska Department of Corrections jails and hospital emergency rooms of Alaskans awaiting involuntary evaluations. The assigned judge found:
“The state was doing nothing to see these Alaskans were transported “immediately” for their evaluations and they were harmed by the prolonged custody.”
The lawsuit settled in 2020 with an agreement the state would fix the problem. It didn’t. 
Meanwhile the Alaska Supreme Court kept seeing the problem. In court challenges brought by psychiatric patients in 2021, 2023, and 2024, the high court confronted cases involving Alaskans who were involuntarily confined for up to 19 days because there was no capacity for evaluations. Vacating the orders in each, the Supreme Court emphasized it was critical for the superior courts to enforce due process because of “the massive curtailment of liberty at stake.”
Still, two courts in Tavis’ case defied those rulings. In two separate petitions two different counselors affirmed to two different superior court judges that there were multiple facilities that would accept Tavis within 24 hours. But the facilities responded they had no capacity. And the two judges confined Tavis a total of 24 days before he was finally transported to an evaluation facility.
Tavis appealed to the Alaska Supreme Court. Two years later, the justices found Tavis’ due process rights had been violated. It vacated the superior court’s order.
Let’s be clear—vacating the orders in all these cases does nothing for the harmed Alaskans. Their prolonged detentions are over. Through years-long ordeals, they receive no compensation, no apology nor even acknowledgement from the state and lower courts. Our high court issued these repeated rulings because they were supposed to prevent future violations. But they haven’t, which leaves a big question:
Why are the superior courts continuing to ignore the law, and why is our Alaska Supreme Court hollowly vacating these violations without doing more? 
The answer came in Tavis’ case when the Alaska Supreme Court conceded that the courts hadn’t anticipated the legislative branch would not adequately fund the involuntary evaluations and commitments it legislated, and that the state (the executive branch) would pursue those evaluations even if it violated due process. And the courts enabled both branches to get away with it.
Alaska’s judiciary must have skipped school when the separation of powers was taught. Judges have the constitutional duty to tell the state that if it doesn’t have room to forcibly detain Alaskans legally, it must release them. That’s what would happen if these Alaskans with mental illness were criminals. 
The Alaska Supreme Court has the power — and duty — to ensure constitutional due process for Alaskans with mental illness. One solution would be for the court to establish a streamlined mechanism where attorneys representing Alaskans being unconstitutionally detained could get an immediate order from the supreme court for the person’s release. 
To fail to act means Alaskans with mental illness will continue to be treated worse than criminals.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Gavel-and-scales-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 15:58:57.102764

(Photo: Greg Childress/NC Newsline)A coalition of municipal and nonprofit organizations has taken legal action to thwart the Trump administration’s move to restrict the amount of federal grant money nonprofits can spend on permanent housing and subsidized rents for formerly homeless people.
The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. It names the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and HUD Secretary Scott Turner as defendants.
The plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to stop what they claim are “unlawful restrictions” before they take effect. They contend the Trump administration announced the changes without substantive advanced notice and on a “highly compressed timeline.” 
At issue are federal Continuum of Care (CoC) grants, which is the largest federal grant program specifically for assisting people experiencing homelessness. HUD announced last month that it would shift two thirds of the $3.9 billion program to transitional housing and other short-term interventions for people experiencing homelessness.
The competitive grants are awarded on a two-year cycle. The second year of funding was expected on Jan. 1, 2026. But HUD is now requiring a new competition one year into the funding cycle. The deadline for letters of intent to reapply for the grants was in November, with formal applications due Jan. 14. 
“Communities were given almost no time to adapt before the funding cycle began, creating widespread confusion and threatening critical housing programs at the peak of winter,” the plaintiffs said in a news release. 
The plaintiffs said the restrictions could force more than 170,000 people into homelessness. Last week, the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, told NC Newsline that nearly 3,000 people in North Carolina could be pushed into homelessness under the changes to the program. The state could lose $24 million in funding, the alliance said.

“At a time when we should all be focused on scaling up and improving our most effective programs, this administration is instead focused on tearing them down,” said Ann Oliva, CEO of the alliance. “These sudden decisions will cause programs to be totally defunded or go without federal funds for at least five months, and likely longer.” 
“We know that conservatively, best case, we will not see awards in our state until the end of May,” Liz Carbone with the NC Coalition to End Homelessness told NC Newsline. “The funding delay alone is going to be so deeply painful for our state.”
Nonprofits in North Carolina may have to ask state and local governments to step in to fill the gaps. That’s likely to be challenging, since the state is currently operating without a new budget, and local governments have long since finalized their budgets for the fiscal year. 
As NC Newsline previously reported, the controversial program changes come as HUD breaks from the long-favored “Housing First” approach, which prioritizes providing immediate access to permanent housing without prerequisites. HUD is moving to a transitional housing approach that includes work and sobriety requirements.

“These long-overdue reforms will promote independence and ensure we are supporting means-tested approaches to carry out the President’s mandate, connect Americans with the help they need, and make our cities and towns beautiful and safe,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a statement announcing the changes.

Could Prime be looking to add two more Rhode Island hospitals to its portfolio? (Photo courtesy of Prime Healthcare)As Prime Healthcare crunches numbers on a potential purchase of Our Lady of Fatima Hospital and Roger Williams Medical Center, the income side of its ledger is poised for a $2 million boost.
The extra money comes from a settlement with the city of Woonsocket, where a local entity of Prime owns and operates Landmark Medical Center. The Woonsocket City Council authorized the payment agreement with Prime under a resolution presented at its meeting Monday. The settlement resolves a longstanding dispute — including three lawsuits — over city tax assessments and bills to the hospital operator that began a decade earlier.
“It’s a lot of money, but it’s very fair,” City Solicitor Michael Lepizzera told the council during its Monday meeting.
Fair perhaps to Prime Healthcare Services – Landmark LLC, the local Woonsocket subsidiary, which alleged in the trio of lawsuits filed in Providence County Superior Court in 2018 and 2019 that the city “illegally” inflated the assessed value of its Woonsocket hospital properties and equipment, leading to “excessive” tax bills from 2015 to 2018.
As part of the settlement, Prime and the city have agreed to toss the lawsuits with prejudice — meaning Prime can’t bring the same complaint against the city again.
“We appreciate the City of Woonsocket’s partnership in resolving tax assessments from the period before Landmark Medical Center was formally recognized as a nonprofit,” Noel True, a spokesperson for Prime, said in a statement Tuesday. “This agreement is the result of a collaborative process that reflects our shared commitment to supporting the hospital’s mission and ensuring stability for the community. We look forward to continuing our strong relationship with the City and providing high-quality, compassionate care for the Woonsocket community for generations to come.”
True did not address how the settlement might affect Prime’s ability to buy Roger Williams and Fatima.
The struggling hospitals face imminent threat of closure by their bankrupt owner, Prospect Medical Holdings, without a sale by the end of the year. The Centurion Foundation, an Atlanta nonprofit received conditional approval to buy the facilities in June 2024 but has been unable to raise the money for the purchase. Amid delays and signals of closure, Gov. Dan McKee’s administration brought in Prime to gauge its interest as an alternative buyer.
An attorney for Prospect told a Texas federal bankruptcy judge on Nov. 25 that he expected to have an update on a deal by Friday. True did not immediately respond to questions regarding the status of Prime’s due diligence on Tuesday.
The Centurion Foundation is on track to secure the investor-backed bond financing “on or around” Jan. 15, CEO Ben Mingle wrote in an affidavit submitted to federal bankruptcy court Monday. Centurion also asked the federal bankruptcy judge to deny Prospect’s motion to close the hospitals by Dec. 31.  
“We are very pleased the new financing process is now underway and we are eager to work with the State’s leaders to meet this financing schedule,” Mingle said in an email Tuesday.
Attorneys for the parties are expected to provide an update at Friday’s court hearing in Dallas.
A ‘Ponzi scheme’ 
Back in Woonsocket, the City Council is firmly focused on former Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt, who it blames for the costly settlement with Prime over Landmark taxes.
“This is part of the Ponzi scheme that was being run out of this building by the prior administration,” Councilor James Cournoyer said during the meeting.
He repeatedly referred to Baldelli-Hunt as the “disgraced former mayor” and her “best-in-the-state tax assessor” Elyse Paré, mocking the descriptor of Paré given by Baldelli-Hunt.
Baldelli-Hunt led the city for a decade before resigning abruptly in November 2023 in the wake of a land purchase that violated city charter rules, first reported by WPRI-TV 12. Since she left, city officials have continued to grapple with the fallout of her administration, from sloppy bookkeeping to employee turnover and a series of settlements with other companies and property owners over allegedly inaccurate property assessments.
Including the $2 million deal with Landmark’s owners, Cournoyer estimates the city has spent $5.5 million to resolve disputes over excessive property tax assessments from Baldelli-Hunt’s administration, including with the owner of a pair of shopping centers on Diamond Hill Road. 
“This is part of a broader pattern,” Cournoyer said in an interview Tuesday. 
Baldelli-Hunt, however, turned the focus back on current elected officials.
“Sometimes people find it easier to settle than to fight for what’s right,” Baldelli-Hunt said in an interview Tuesday. “They’re not fighting for the city of Woonsocket.”










Sometimes people find it easier to settle than to fight for what’s right. They’re not fighting for the city of Woonsocket.


– Former Woonsocket Mayor Lisa Baldelli-Hunt responding to criticism by City Councilor James Cournoyer


Paré, who left Woonsocket in 2019 to take a job as tax assessor for the city of Providence, did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Tuesday. She left her job with Providence in 2021 and now owns a wine bar in East Greenwich, according to her LinkedIn page.
Baldelli-Hunt also said the tax years in dispute were a period of transition for Landmark Medical Center, which limited her authority over tax assessments. Prime bought the struggling hospital in 2013, following a five-year bankruptcy process. In 2017, Prime successfully converted the facility from for-profit to nonprofit status. Prime’s lawsuits also alleged the city wrongfully billed it for property and tangible taxes in 2018, even though as a federally recognized tax-exempt organization, it no longer had to pay local taxes.
‘We’re getting hit twice.’
Roger Williams and Fatima would also be returned to nonprofit status under a sale to either Prime or Centurion, the buyers said. Without new, voluntary agreements with the city of Providence and town of North Providence, the sale and change in status would cost the two municipalities a combined $8.5 million in property taxes in fiscal 2026, according to their leaders. 
The city of Providence has not had any formal discussions with any buyers regarding an alternative tax payment schedule, Anthony Vega, a spokesperson for Mayor Brett Smiley’s office, said in an email Tuesday.
“The City remains committed to doing everything possible to ensure the hospital continues serving the community while maintaining proper fiscal stability,” Vega said.
North Providence Mayor Charles Lombardi also said he had not spoken with Centurion or Prime about tax payments to the town.
“We’re hoping it’s for-profit so then we get tax dollars,” Lombardi said in an interview Tuesday.
Woonsocket has forgone property and tangible tax payments from Landmark since 2019; it would have received more than $1 million in property tax revenue alone based on the $50 million assessed value of the main hospital facility. 
The city’s settlement payments back to Prime are spread out over the next five years, with an initial $250,000 payment by Dec. 31. Jim Lathrop, the city finance director, confirmed in an interview Tuesday that the city has enough money to make the first payment based on revenue from an October tax sale.
But fulfilling the future financial obligations to Prime might be difficult, Lathrop acknowledged. 
In addition to the $2 million payments, the city has also agreed to suspend fees for water and sewer charges, and issue credits, equal to $80,000 by Sept. 1, 2029.
“We’re getting hit twice,” Council President Dan Gendron said during the meeting.
Cournoyer warned of future tax hikes.
A $500,000 payment — the amount due each year for 2026, 2027 and 2028 — represents 1% of the existing $55 million annual city tax levy.
“That puts a considerable strain on finances, that will likely result in us having to raise taxes at a greater rate than we otherwise would have,” he said.
Lathrop hinted that there be alternative savings strategies that would cover the settlement costs, but declined to specify when asked, awaiting action by the council.

Toby Overdorf speaks to reporters after a property tax meeting on Nov. 20, 2025. (Photo by Liv  Caputo/Florida Phoenix)Fears of decimated fire departments dominated Tuesday’s Florida House committee hearing on proposals to slash property taxes.
Democrats in the House State Affairs Committee joined pro-local groups and a small-town fire chief in raising concern that House Republicans’ four proposed resolutions to amend the state Constitution would starve fire departments and emergency management services.
Because each of the resolutions would ban cutting the property taxes that fund schools or law enforcement, that would leave fire and EMS without much of the money they’ve come to rely on, the opponents claimed.
“How many firefighters are dispensable? That’s the question,” said Rep. Ashley Gantt, a Miami Democrat. “This bill is premature. There is no data, there is no research, and, quite frankly it’s insulting to the men and women who serve us everyday who aren’t law enforcement.”
“The financial impact [these bills] will have on our fire and EMS services could be devastating,” Williston Fire Chief Lamar Stegall agreed. Thirty percent of his county’s EMS budget comes from property taxes, he continued, adding, “If our fire departments go down, what happens then?”
The Florida Association of Counties, Florida League of Cities, and officials from Jacksonville Beach, Orange County, and South Pasadena echoed these fears, claiming that slashing property taxes without proposing alternative revenue is a “fiscal crisis by design.”
A total of seven proposed amendments to the Florida Constitution and one bill have been filed by House Republicans ahead of the 2026 session. This came — somewhat ironically — because Gov. Ron DeSantis last year demanded the Legislature find a way to slash or eliminate property taxes, which have drastically risen in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic.
But DeSantis has spurned the proposals, calling them “milquetoast” and scoffing at the lower chamber’s willingness to put all the measures on the ballot for voters.
His public uninterest has been part of a broader feud between DeSantis and House Speaker Danny Perez, who declared that the Florida House would become more independent of the governor than it had been as DeSantis geared up for his failed presidential bid in 2023.
‘Nothing restricts cities from funding fire.’
Only four of the eight measures were taken up Tuesday in the second of three scheduled committee hearings. The other four will likely be scheduled for next week’s State Affairs hearing.
And despite hours of backlash, the four proposals passed along party lines. The Republicans pushed back on predictions of harm to fire and EMS services, noting that they could attempt to smooth problems if voters approve their proposals, or that fire departments could start pulling from a separate taxing fund through higher fees.
“Firefighters have the ability to … have a fee there,” said Rep. Monique Miller, a Palm Bay Republican co-sponsoring one of the measures. “There are a multitude of ways that you can fund law enforcement and firefighters.”
Some county fire departments pull from a Municipal Services Taxing Unit, she said. This is a special revenue fund fueled by charges for services, permits, fees, and special assessments.
Co-sponsor Rep. Kevin Steele claimed that in his county, Pasco, local firefighters rely on such an entity as a partial alternative funding source to property taxes.
“Instead of there being ad valorem taxes, there’s an MSTU separated from that, and there’s an ability for them to do that,” said Steele, who’s running to serve as the state’s Chief Financial Officer in 2026. That duty entails serving as the state’s chief fire marshal.
Roughly 30%, or $56 million, of Pasco fire funding comes from property taxes. About 60% comes from the MSTU.
Although none of the public testimony supported the property tax measures, other Republicans did. This included Rep. Fabian Basabe, representing Miami Beach.
“These bills don’t touch fire millage,” he said, accusing the Democrats of “gaslighting” and using “spin” to allegedly turn the measures into something they’re not. “Nothing restricts cities from funding fire.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0385-1024x1004.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 15:58:57.102764

Nayra Guzmán knew there was something wrong with her daughter within hours of her birth — a long and complicated delivery that included a diagnosis of preeclampsia and ended in a Cesarean section. In the haze of recovery, the first-time mom noticed her daughter was struggling to breathe. When the baby started turning blue, Guzmán watched as doctors whisked her away to the neonatal intensive care unit.
In the days that followed, the 22-year-old’s sole focus was her daughter’s recovery, even as their home, the greater Chicago area, became the latest target of President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda in a campaign titled Operation Midway Blitz.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

“We weren’t worried about the immigration raids,” said Guzmán, an immigrant from Mexico who has a pending petition for asylum and a pending application for a visa for victims of crime. “Our worry was, ‘How are we going to get this baby home and out of the hospital?’ That was our number one priority, that she would be safe and healthy, and everything else had fallen to the background.”
That changed on the morning of Monday, Oct. 20. Just 15 days after her daughter’s birth, as Guzmán, her mom and younger brother loaded into their car for their daily drive to the NICU, they were surrounded by immigration enforcement agents and whisked away to detention.
Since Trump took office in January, the administration has abandoned Department of Homeland Security policies restricting the arrest and detention of immigrants who have recently given birth, are pregnant or are nursing. As a result, the administration has taken into custody immigrants like Guzmán, who are medically vulnerable and whose detention threatens not only their own health but also that of their newborn children — typically U.S. citizens — by depriving them of early bonding beneficial to a baby’s lifelong wellbeing.

The administration’s sudden expansion of immigration arrests in Chicago meant Guzmán was in the government’s custody for about 34 hours. She was kept  in a holding facility that was intended to house people for only a small fraction of that time — one that has come under intense scrutiny amid allegations of overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and limited medical care. Even though she was still trying to produce breast milk for her daughter, Guzmán had limited access to food and water at the Broadview Processing Center and was never provided a breast pump. She said she was never assessed by a medical professional while in the government’s custody. Guzmán was left to manage the pain of her C-section recovery as well as her Type 1 diabetes with the supplies she had in her backpack at the time of her arrest.
ICE did not respond to a request for comment on Guzmán’s detention or the general conditions at Broadview for immigrants who have recently given birth.
Medical professionals say the conditions of many detention facilities — crowded, dirty and with inconsistent access to health care, food and water — are a threat to most people’s health. They pose particularly acute concerns for people who are still navigating the physical and psychological weight of postpartum recovery like Guzmán.

News reports, lawyers, Democratic lawmakers and immigration rights activists have identified dozens of cases of pregnant, postpartum and nursing individuals who have been detained and whose health has suffered as a result. But the total amount remains unknown: In March, the Republican-led Congress let lapse a requirement that Homeland Security report twice a year on the number of pregnant, postpartum and nursing individuals who have been detained. The Trump administration has declined to provide that information despite repeated requests from lawmakers, The 19th and others.
Now, as the administration expands its immigration enforcement campaign, exporting its Chicago strategy to Charlotte and New Orleans, Guzmán’s case offers a rare window into detention for pregnant and postpartum immigrants. Guzmán is also among the growing number of immigrants who are being detained despite having no criminal record, even as the administration insists its immigration enforcement agenda targets criminals and people who pose a safety threat to the country.

The family had finished breakfast and was loading into the car with some urgency. Guzmán’s daughter was still in the NICU, unable to eat or breathe independently. The doctors had planned a meeting to review the baby’s prognosis and care plans — and Guzmán also wanted to be there for her daughter’s noon feeding.
As Guzmán went to buckle her seatbelt, she looked out the window and noticed they were surrounded. By the look of the white SUVs, Guzmán said, the family knew immediately that they were being detained by immigration agents.
Guzmán remembers the agents asking where they were born and what paperwork they could show. The family, who arrived in the country three years ago, showed the agents their work permits and explained their pending asylum application. The family also explained that they were on their way to the NICU, and an agent approached Guzmán to ask how long it had been since the birth. With that information, they did not handcuff her as she was being detained.
Guzmán asked if she could please call the hospital to let them know she wouldn’t be coming in that day. Guzmán remembers an agent saying she’d have to talk about that with a judge, who would decide whether she would be released or go back to Mexico. The agents explained that after processing, she’d likely be going to a longer-term detention facility in Kentucky.

“In that moment, I just felt fear,” Guzmán said. “I thought, ‘The government is going to take custody of my daughter. I’m going to be in detention and I won’t be able to do anything for my daughter.’ If my daughter isn’t recovering with me there, I thought, then much less so if I’m arrested.”
Up to that point, Guzmán said the pain and difficulty of her own recovery had been overshadowed by her daughter’s. When she was with her, it all faded away. As she was being detained, it came into focus.
Guzmán’s C-section incision was throbbing on the ride to Broadview. The agent behind the wheel was driving fast over potholes, she said, despite pleas from her brother that Guzmán was in a fragile state following her surgery, which involved cutting through seven layers of tissue.
“How is it possible that I’m going all the way to Kentucky, in this state, six hours away? My scar is burning. I’m supposed to be resting,” she thought.
Once she arrived at Broadview, Guzmán said, she was taken to a room and examined by two immigration agents. They asked Guzmán to explain how her insulin pump and monitor worked and what medications she had in her backpack. One agent asked Guzmán to take off her belly binder, a stretchy garment that supports the abdomen after surgery. She declined, explaining that without it, she’d have a hard time managing the pain.
“I overheard another agent say, ‘Leave it. They’ll take it at the detention center,’” Guzmán recalled.
Eventually, she was transferred to a holding cell for women alongside her mom. They were given water and a sandwich at around 3 p.m., Guzmán said, her first meal since they were detained around 10 a.m.
The only places for rest inside the holding cell were small benches. Guzmán spent the night on one without a blanket or anything but what she had on her body.
“It was really uncomfortable. I was wearing two layers of leggings, two layers of socks, my sweatshirt, and I was still freezing,” Guzmán said. “Once I was laying down, I couldn’t really move because of the pain. And then I started to feel cramping in my uterus.”
C-section recovery typically involves six to eight weeks of rest, gentle movement, wound care and pain management. At a minimum, patients only 15 days out from a C-section require a bed, access to a breast pump, clean water and a sanitary restroom to change menstrual pads, said Dr. Beth Cronin, an OB-GYN in Rhode Island and chair of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology’s Committee of Advancing Equity in Obstetric and Gynecologic Health Care. They need access to a shower, and they need extra food — especially if they are breastfeeding.
“Those are medical necessities. You would never take anybody else who just had major surgery and give them a bench,” Cronin said upon learning about Guzmán’s case. The risk of infection is heightened for patients with Type 1 diabetes, she added.
Guzmán’s detention was made more difficult by the fact that she was held in a temporary ICE processing facility lacking the services of longer-term detention centers.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In a class-action suit filed Oct. 30, nine days after Guzmán’s release, people who had been detained at Broadview described overcrowded and dirty cells; limited food and water; no access to showers, soap or menstrual supplies; inadequate medical care; and freezing conditions at night. Multiple people with diabetes said they were given only a sandwich at every meal, though bread can cause blood sugar spikes. Days later, a judge said he found the accounts “highly credible,” and described the conditions as “unnecessarily cruel.”
In another case, filed by a nursing woman detained Oct. 30 and released a day later, government officials conceded that they were not aware of any accommodations at Broadview — such as a lactation room or breast pump — that would allow detained immigrants to express breastmilk.
“Oversight of this facility is desperately needed as legal service providers and our constituents have raised concerns about the poor conditions at Broadview,” reads a letter signed by the state’s two senators and its 14 Democratic representatives, who have been denied entry to assess the conditions of the facility. “These reports allege unsanitary bathroom facilities; spreading illness; continued overcrowding; detainees sleeping on the floor or in chairs; a lack of access to food, water or hygiene products; restricted communications to family members and attorneys; and an inability to access medication.”
“Whether it’s a detention center, whether it’s any federal building under the Department of Homeland Security, we have to make sure that we are enacting and enforcing the policies to protect people,” said Rep. Delia Ramirez, who represents a Chicago-area district and has been pushing for more transparency around conditions at Broadview.
Under any circumstances, Cronin said, having a newborn requiring intensive care can be deeply traumatizing for someone who has just given birth. A large body of medical research suggests that early bonding between a parent and newborn can help nurture an infant’s brain development — fostering social, emotional and cognitive development — and can alleviate anxiety in someone newly postpartum.

Guzmán said that prior to her arrest, she was at the hospital daily, and would often get time “piel a piel,” or skin-to-skin, with her daughter. While in custody, Guzmán had no access to any information about her daughter. A relative had contacted immigration attorneys to sue for Guzmán’s release; the same lawyers had Guzmán’s father appointed as a temporary guardian for her daughter. Her father and uncle drove to the hospital — risking detention themselves — to visit the baby while Guzmán was in detention.
“Even if she had an uncomplicated vaginal birth without an incision, it’s still the fact that you’re separating a newly postpartum person from their baby in this way and putting them at personal risk to contract infection and get sick and not be appropriately nourished and be able to empty their breasts,” Cronin said. “And all of that is terrifying.”
Citing Guzmán’s health and that of her newborn daughter, her lawyers successfully petitioned a judge to order the family’s release. The three of them left Broadview at around 8 p.m. on October 21, avoiding a transfer to a long-term detention facility, such as the one in Kentucky. It was too late to visit the hospital that day. The family waited for close to 30 minutes in the rain before their attorneys could pick them up, said Laura Smith, a lawyer who argued for the release of Guzmán and her family. Their first stop was for a meal at Portillo’s, a local fast food chain that specializes in Chicago-style hot dogs.
Even climbing a flight of stairs was difficult for Guzmán, Smith recalled: She had to walk backward, relying on her family for support.
After her release, Guzmán fell ill with flu-like symptoms, which kept her separated from her daughter for almost a week. After going almost two days with little food or water and without access to a breast pump, Guzmán said, her breastmilk dried up.
While her daughter has made significant strides, she continues to need NICU care. Guzmán said her daughter still relies on a feeding tube, and doctors have ordered more tests to arrive at a diagnosis. Going outside — even to see her daughter — feels dangerous in a way it didn’t before.
“When I first got home, I felt relieved. But the next day, I had to face reality. I was telling myself, ‘You have to leave the house and see your baby.’ But I had this horrible fear that they would detain me again,” Guzmán said.
There is no active deportation case against Guzmán, and her visa application is still pending. She keeps having flashbacks to her arrest and detention: the sound of chains and handcuffs being thrown around by immigration agents, the screaming, the way the men arrive at the detention facility “all beat up and dirty.”
“It’s a deep fear and this feeling that there are eyes watching you everywhere.”

NEW CASTLE, Del. — The Delaware River and Bay Authority has taken a major step toward adding a new “green” ferry to the Cape May–Lewes Ferry fleet, awarding a $78.6 million construction contract for a diesel-hybrid vessel expected to begin service later this decade.
The DRBA Commission on Nov. 18 unanimously approved a contract with SENESCO Marine LLC of North Kingstown, R.I., to build and outfit a new 75-car passenger and vehicle ferry. The new vessel is expected to eventually replace the MV Cape Henlopen, an over 40-year-old diesel-powered ferry that currently runs between Lewes, Delaware, and Cape May, New Jersey.
“For sustainable ferry operations in the future, it’s imperative we make this necessary capital investment today,” DRBA Executive Director Joel Coppadge said in a statement. “The Ferry’s a critical piece of regional infrastructure, and we’re proud of the Ferry’s heritage and link between two historic destinations. The new hybrid ferry is the start of the next chapter in the proud history of the Cape May–Lewes Ferry.”
The hybrid vessel is designed to significantly reduce emissions while cutting fuel use by an estimated 35%. DRBA officials say the ferry will operate with lower emissions at sea and zero emissions while in port or docked. Annual reductions are projected at 2,025 tons of carbon dioxide, 102.7 tons of nitrogen dioxide, 1.51 tons of fine particulate matter, 1.03 tons of hydrocarbons and 5 tons of carbon monoxide.
“The Cape May–Lewes Ferry is a vital transportation link and an economic catalyst for the southern regions of Delaware and New Jersey,” said Heath Gehrke, the authority’s director of ferry operations. “Hundreds of thousands of people rely on our year-round service to get them safely across to work, visit loved ones, get to that vacation destination or to avoid the hassle of highway congestion. By moving forward with our vessel modernization effort, we’re ensuring that future generations will continue to enjoy a break from the ordinary aboard the Cape May–Lewes Ferry.”
The $78.6 million project is being partially funded with a $20 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The contract award is subject to a 10-day review and consent period by the governors of Delaware and New Jersey.
With the bid awarded, construction on the new ferry is slated to begin early next year, with a projected completion date in summer 2029.
The DRBA, a bi-state agency created in 1962, owns and operates the Cape May–Lewes Ferry, the Delaware Memorial Bridge and the Forts Ferry Crossing, and manages five airports in Delaware and New Jersey.
Since it began service on July 1, 1964, the Cape May–Lewes Ferry has carried more than 50 million passengers across the Delaware Bay. DRBA officials say the ferry system supports more than 4,000 jobs and generates hundreds of millions of dollars in regional economic activity, making the new hybrid vessel both an environmental and economic investment in the future of coastal Delaware and South Jersey.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/New-Ferry-Vessel-Rendering.png,,,2025-12-02 14:57:14.405987

(Photos by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch; photo illustration via Canva) Local chapters of the International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators unions have endorsed state Rep. Josh Turek and Sen. Zach Wahls in the Democratic primary for Iowa’s U.S. Senate seat.
The Heat and Frost Insulators Local 39 in Council Bluffs and Omaha, Nebraska endorsed Turek, a Council Bluffs Democrat, saying he was a strong supporter of unions in the Legislature. Turek, a two-time Paralympic gold medalist, has served in the Iowa House since 2022.
“We’re proud to support Josh for U.S. Senate because we know he’ll continue his record of supporting unions,” John Hanson, business manager for Insulators Local 39 said in a statement. “He’s been a fighter for the working class during his time in the state legislature and we know he’ll take that same fight to Washington.”

Turek said in a statement he was “honored” to have his campaign endorsed the union, adding to a list of endorsements from Iowa Democratic leaders, including former Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, former Lt. Gov. Sally Pederson and Iowa Rep. J.D. Scholten, who was also previously running for the U.S. Senate seat in 2026 and endorsed Turek’s campaign after dropping out.
“In working class communities like mine, unions are essential to providing good-paying jobs and benefits that support families,” Turek said. “At a time when Washington is more focused on billionaires, I’ll continue fighting for the working class and the unions that make it strong.”
Turek is running against Wahls and Nathan Sage, former Knoxville chamber of commerce executive director, for the Democratic nomination in 2026. The winner of the Democratic primary is expected to face U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, who quickly became the frontrunner for the GOP nomination after U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst announced she would not seek reelection.
Wahls, D-Coralville, announced on Tuesday he had also received an endorsement from an Iowa Insulators union in the race, coming from the Heat and Frost Insulators Local 81 union, serving the Quad-Cities area in eastern Iowa and western Illinois.
Sean Nagle, business manager for the Insulators Local 81 union, said Wahls “fights for working people every single day.”
“He’s been a consistent advocate for labor, someone we can count on to protect our right to organize, stand up for safe jobs, and defend fair wages and benefits,” Nagle said in a statement. “Our members are worried about rising costs and shrinking paychecks, and Zach is laser-focused on exactly that — boosting workers’ pay, lowering costs for families, and taking on the corporate special interests that are squeezing our members. Insulators Local 81 is proud to stand with Zach Wahls in this race.”
Wahls has received endorsements from several other Iowa labor unions, including Teamsters Local 90, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1846, Communications Workers of America Local 7110 and Ironworkers Locals 67, 89, and 111. He has also been endorsed by officials like former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander and Council Bluffs Mayor-elect Jill Shudak.
The state senator said if elected to the U.S. Senate, he would work to support Iowa unions and the workers they represent, which he said “are the backbone of Iowa’s middle class.”
“I know what it means when a good union job keeps a family above water,” Wahls said. “In the Senate, I’ll fight to raise wages, pass the PRO Act, protect pensions, and make sure every Iowan who works hard can actually get ahead — not just scrape by while billionaires and big corporations write the rules.”

(Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)As Pennsylvanians pull out their snow gear and shovel walkways for the first time this season, the state is set to begin accepting applications for its Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program on Wednesday. 
The state Department of Human Services usually opens applications in November, but delayed LIHEAP when it hadn’t received funds due to the longest federal government shutdown in history. The federally funded program received $229 million in 2024, which helps offset heating bills for more than 300,000 Pennsylvanians. 
The Trump administration distributed funds under the block grant last week. Applications for LIHEAP will be open until April 10, 2026. 
Energy assistance need ‘tremendous’ in Pa., but shutdown halts delivery of critical funds

“Pennsylvanians deserve the safety and health benefits that come from being able to heat their homes and keep themselves and their families warm through the winter,” said Human Services  Secretary Val Arkoosh in a statement. “LIHEAP helps hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians each year by providing cash and crisis grants directly to the eligible household’s utility company or heating fuel provider, and I am very glad that we are finally able to begin this important work.” 
Awards range from $200 to $1,000, though the average benefit in 2024 was $336. To qualify for the one-time grant, individuals and families must make at or below 150% of the federal poverty level — or $22,590 for an individual and $46,800 for a family of four. 
Separately, Pennsylvanians may qualify for LIHEAP crisis grants up to $1,000 if they’re at risk of getting their heating service terminated or have less than two weeks’ worth of deliverable fuel, which includes oil, propane, coal or wood.
The state’s moratorium on heating and electricity disconnections started in November and lasts until March 31. That moratorium applies to families making up to 250% of the federal poverty level, or $39,125 for an individual and $80,375 for a family of four. 
Families still have to pay their winter bills in the spring, potentially with the assistance of LIHEAP. The moratorium doesn’t include households using deliverable fuels or those getting energy from rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities because they aren’t regulated by the state Public Utility Commission.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1528-1-dragged-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 14:57:14.405987

(Amanda Berg for the Capital-Star)Buried in a code bill passed with the 2025-26 state budget is a provision giving a single school district $5 million, outside of the typical formulas that are used to distribute funds to Pennsylvania’s school districts.
The bill didn’t mention the district by name, but specified the money is to go to one “in a county of the second class A with a 2021-2022 adjusted daily membership greater than 5,590 and less than 5,595.”
It  could only be William Penn, a Delaware County district represented by state House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia).
William Penn has struggled financially for years, and was one of the six plaintiff school districts in a lawsuit that led to Pennsylvania’s method of distributing money to schools being overturned in 2023. The Commonwealth Court called it unconstitutionally inequitable.

District officials reached out to lawmakers to advocate for additional funding – as they do every year – during negotiations over the latest state budget, according to Jennifer Hoff, who sits on the William Penn Board of School Directors and chairs its Budget & Finance Committee. 
William Penn needed the money even more than usual this year because the state budget impasse forced the district to borrow – and incur interest – to make up for delayed funding from the commonwealth, Hoff said. 
“William Penn has long struggled and advocated for themselves around funding,” Hoff said. “We need to be properly funded. That’s what caused the problem, that’s what keeps the problems going. It’s more expensive to be poor than rich. Your insurance rates go up, it costs more to borrow. That’s where William Penn is. We never get ahead, and it’s a government-made problem.”
More than two dozen other school districts, at minimum, likewise took out loans and incurred interest, according to the Pennsylvania State Education Association.
Asked why William Penn School District received additional funds, Beth Rementer, a spokesperson for the House Democratic caucus said in a statement, “the guiding principle for the House Democratic caucus has always been and always will be to help the least advantaged. There is an overlap to the extent that our leaders represent some of the poorest areas. Maybe that is a good thing.”
Rementer did not respond to follow-up questions about whether specific issues elevated William Penn’s funding needs above other districts. 
Dan Urevick-Ackelsberg, a senior attorney at the Public Interest Law Center, which represented William Penn in the case that led to the creation of the adequacy formula, provided some clarity about the district’s unique needs.
William Penn recently found itself facing a $9.2 million deficit after uncovering record keeping issues and under-budgeting problems. That’s led the school district to consider cutting staff, including administrators and academic interventionists who work one-on-one with struggling students.
“I do think the context matters,” Urevick-Ackelsberg said. “They’re a district that has a judgement against the state for unconstitutional underfunding, and their budget situation, if anything, is even worse than previously understood … This was a catastrophe for them.”

Deirdre Abrahamsson, a William Penn spokesperson, said the district has taken steps to ensure that similar bookkeeping issues don’t come up again.
“We have implemented new internal controls and updated financial procedures to standardize record keeping and documentation,” she said. Staff have received training in purchasing, payroll, and budget reporting to ensure consistency and compliance across all schools and departments. Oversight and accountability have also been increased, with more frequent internal reviews and stronger collaboration between the Business Office, administrators, and auditors.”
The district is still making decisions about what to do with the $5 million from the state, according to school board member Hoff. 
It’s likely the money will go toward developing curriculum and mental health services. With the funds amounting to a one-time cash infusion instead of recurring revenue, the district is wary about using it on recurring costs like staffing, Hoff said.
Kayla Anderson, a spokesperson for Gov. Josh Shapiro, who was a key negotiator for both the 2024-25 and 2025-26 budgets, did not respond to specific questions from the Capital-Star. 
But she said in a statement, that the most recent spending plan, “takes seriously the need to drive dollars out to the schools that need them most to ensure every Pennsylvania student has access to an adequate, equitable education. The final budget agreement was the result of a thoughtful, considered negotiation with all leaders in both parties.”
Additional funding part of a Capitol compromise
This is the second year in a row that the state budget has included additional funding for school districts represented by members of House Democratic leadership.
Last year, Democratic lawmakers pushed for an adjustment to the adequacy funding formula, devised to help the least advantaged schools in the wake of the lawsuit. Ultimately, that led to 11 school districts receiving an additional $14 million annually –all represented by Democratic House members, including members of leadership. William Penn was one of them.\

Democratic lawmakers  said the move was the result of a compromise with Senate Republicans, who successfully pushed for changes to the adequacy formula that resulted in dozens of school districts – including those 11 – receiving less funding than Democrats had hoped. 
The compromise, they said, protected districts that both genuinely needed money and were important to House Democrats whose votes were necessary to pass a budget and ensure the adequacy formula was enacted at all.
All 11 districts that received additional funding were affected by changes to the adequacy formula proposed by Republicans. But other districts – including many represented by GOP members –  were affected as well, according to an analysis by the Capital-Star.
“There are 500 school districts across the Commonwealth, and each have their own definition of what fair funding means,” Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) said in a statement. “For years, our Commonwealth has been dealing with formulas which seek to implement greater ‘fairness’, yet there is no universally agreed to definition of fairness. As we continue to meet our obligation to support educational opportunities for all children in Pennsylvania, looking at how adequacy dollars are dispersed remains a topic of conversation.”
Urevick-Ackelsberg believes House Democrats, led by McClinton, have shown their bona fides advocating for better funding for K-12 schools across Pennsylvania, including in rural areas largely represented by Republicans.
“If I were evaluating Speaker McClinton fairly, I think I would say she’s been a really good champion for increasing school funding. And I think by any reasonable metric, that caucus has repeatedly passed both fiscal reforms and more aggressive funding increases, but they haven’t passed both sides,” Urevick-Ackelsberg said.
While he would like to see broader changes to Pennsylvania’s school funding model that would help more schools, Urevick-Ackelsberg sees the $5 million for William Penn as a necessary expenditure for a district in crisis, though.
“William Penn is in a pretty unique position in that this district that was the named plaintiff in the school funding litigation, and has a judgement against the state, was facing acute disaster,” he said. “I don’t think you can draw any conclusions except to say we need to get all school districts this money on a faster timeline.”
Originally, a seven-year plan to add $5.4 billion to the state budget for struggling districts was presented by a commission of lawmakers and members of the Shapiro administration. They’d been tasked with developing the plan by Commonwealth Court in 2023 when it ruled the state’s school funding formula was unconstitutionally inequitable.
But, lawmakers extended the timeline to nine years at the insistence of the Senate GOP majority. 
“We aren’t getting it out nearly as fast as it needs to go,” Urevick-Ackelsberg said. “If you’re a child who’s starting kindergarten, you’ll be in ninth grade before schools are adequately funded.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230530_Cap_Star_Edu_Funding_643_EDIT-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 14:57:14.405987

If U.S. District Court Judge Stefan Underhill grants the request, it could delay Diamantis’ second corruption trial, scheduled for early February.
Diamantis, the former Democratic deputy secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, is facing bribery, extortion and filing false statement charges for his alleged role in pressuring state employees to cancel a 2020 audit that was examining the Medicaid and Medicare billing of a Bristol optometry practice
In a separate case regarding school construction projects, Diamantis was convicted by a jury in late October on 21 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators. He is facing between 10 and 12 years in prison on those charges, according to Pattis. 
Sentencing on those charges has been postponed until after the second trial. Diamantis is currently free on $500,000 bail.
Pattis said in his motion that he will continue as Diamantis’ attorney for the sentencing from the first trial but that doing the second trial without getting paid “would be a hardship” for his firm. 
“Mr. Diamantis has thus far not fulfilled his obligation as to services for that trial that has gone to verdict and has been warned that the undersigned will move to withdraw if the responsibility is not fulfilled,” Pattis wrote. “In the instant case, the undersigned contends it would be hardship to his firm to continue with representation to a second trial when the client’s obligations arising under the first trial have yet to be fulfilled.”
Underhill has not responded to Pattis’ motion as of Tuesday. It is unclear whether the judge would hold a hearing to question both Pattis and Diamantis about the fee dispute. 
In his motion, Pattis said Diamantis would oppose the motion and said it was unclear if federal prosecutors would take a position. Diamantis said Tuesday he didn’t want to comment.
Jury selection for the second trial is supposed to begin Jan. 30, but if Pattis is allowed to withdraw, it could delay the trial while a new attorney familiarizes themselves with the case.
The indictment in the upcoming trial alleges that Diamantis conspired with Helen Zervas, owner of Family Eye Care, and Christopher Ziogas, a former Democratic state lawmaker and her fiancé, to get a potentially damaging audit canceled. In exchange, she allegedly paid Diamantis about $95,000.
Both Zervas and Ziogas have pleaded guilty, and Pattis has said he expects both of them to testify at the second trial. 
Ziogas appeared in federal court last week and changed his plea to guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert M. Spector, who asked Ziogas to describe in his own words what he had done.
“I participated in a scheme with Helen and Kosta to try and have him suppress some activity in Medicaid charges that she was facing,” Ziogas said, adding, “We paid him to help influence the outcome of the audit.” 
When asked by the judge what he had specifically done, Ziogas added, “Helen gave me money, and I gave it to Kosta — maybe $100,000.”
There is no mention in the 13-page plea agreement about whether Ziogas will be required to testify at Diamantis’ upcoming trial in the Zervas matter, and the issue was not brought up during last week’s hearing. 
Ziogas is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 18. Under the plea agreement, he is facing between 70-87 months in prison. Ziogas was allowed to remain free on the $500,000 bail that has been in place since his arrest last February.
The case has its roots in a Medicaid audit that was scheduled in early 2020.
It was during the height of COVID, in May 2020, when Diamantis and Ziogas hand-delivered a check for nearly $600,000 to the Department of Social Services in order to reimburse the state Medicaid program for services that Zervas improperly billed.
After that check was delivered to the DSS office in Hartford, the audit into Zervas’ optometry practice was dropped, which prevented state auditors from combing through her records and potentially clawing back even more money for the state.
The CT Mirror reported that the audit of Bristol Eye Care was the only one that DSS canceled over a five-year period. 
Diamantis and Ziogas previously told the CT Mirror that there was nothing illegal about the $600,000 payment, and they said their involvement had nothing to do with the agency ending the scheduled audit of Zervas’ practice.
Zervas pleaded guilty last February to health care fraud charges and admitted that she conspired with a former state lawmaker and former high-ranking Connecticut employee to pressure officials at the state’s Medicaid agency to cancel an audit that was examining Medicaid overpayments at her optometry practice.
The federal prosecutors said Zervas fraudulently billed the state’s Medicaid program on more than 300 occasions between 2015 and 2020. She did the same for Medicare patients, but less frequently.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0228_SR_FederalCourtKosta_068-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 13:57:25.354131

Scott and Lambert Junttila allegedly allowed “unauthorized computer examiner access to voter data, including non-public voter information,” according to Nessel’s office. When the charges were first announced in May 2024, Nessel noted that Scott also allegedly refused to turn over a voting tabulator for maintenance and testing, as well as that Lambert Junttila “illicitly transmitted data from the Adams Township Electronic Poll Book concerning the 2020 General Election under the direction of Scott.”
“The deliberate violation of voter privacy to push a false agenda and spew misinformation is reckless and illegal,” Nessel said in Tuesday’s press release. “My office takes these allegations very seriously and looks forward to further pursuing this case through the judicial process to defend the rights of Michiganders and protect their personal election data.”  
Scott and Lambert Junttila are each facing felony charges of Using a Computer to Commit a Crime, Computers – Unauthorized Access, and Conspiracy to Commit the Offense of Computers – Unauthorized Access. Scott also faces a felony charge of Misconduct in Office and a misdemeanor charge of Disobeying a Lawful Instruction or Order of the Secretary of State as Chief Election Officer. 
Lambert Junttila is also facing charges in Oakland County for separate charges of alleged voter machine tampering, which she was indicted for in 2023 alongside former Republican attorney general nominee Matt DePerno and former state Rep. Daire Rendon (R-Lake City).

Nov. 4, 2025. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Shenna Bellows and 11 other secretaries of state are objecting to the federal government’s repurposing of a data tool to identify noncitizen voters, arguing doing so oversteps state authority and puts Americans’ private data at risk.
President Donald Trump’s administration rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice started asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The Trump administration sued Maine after Bellows twice rejected these requests. 
“While DHS claims that its changes to SAVE make it an effective tool for voter eligibility verification, the modifications to SAVE are likely to degrade, not enhance, state efforts to ensure free, fair, and secure elections,” the 12 secretaries of state wrote in comments submitted to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Monday.
Previously, SAVE could only conduct searches one name at a time. Now, it can conduct bulk searches, making it possible to feed millions of voters’ information into the tool and have it check those records against a series of federal databases to try to verify someone’s immigration status. 
In November, Bellows and other secretaries of state also sent a letter to the Trump administration asking whether federal agencies actively misled election officials regarding the use of the voter data it requested from states, in light of federal officials acknowledging that the Department of Justice shared voter roll information with Homeland Security to search it for noncitizens. 
In the comments submitted on Monday, the secretaries of state argue that the repurposed SAVE tool has not been proven to be reliable for voter verification purposes and using it as such will lead to misidentifying eligible voters as non-citizens, chilling voter participation. 
State election officials ​in letter ​ask if they were ‘misled’ by Trump administration

What the modified system will do, they wrote, is allow the federal government to seize states’ constitutional authority to regulate and administer their own elections and threaten to expose hundreds of millions of Americans’ private data to cyberattack and misuse. 
“And all these risks must be considered against a single backdrop: American elections are free, fair, and secure,” they added. “Study after study confirms that the so-called ‘problem’ that SAVE targets does not exist: Non-citizen voting is exceedingly rare.” 
These objections from Bellows and the secretaries of state of California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington come after four Republican states agreed to help the Trump administration gain access to state driver’s license data through SAVE. 
Florida, Indiana, Iowa and Ohio initially sued former President Joe Biden’s administration last year alleging it wasn’t doing enough to help states verify voter eligibility. 
As part of a settlement agreement on Friday, the federal government is required to continue its development of SAVE and, in return, the GOP states agreed to support Homeland Security’s efforts to access the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, also called Nlets, an obscure computer network that typically allows law enforcement agencies to search driver’s license records across state lines.
Maine Morning Star’s partner outlet Stateline reported last week, before the settlement agreement was filed in court, that Homeland Security publicly confirmed it wants to connect Nlets to SAVE.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/election-day-2025-19-Large-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 13:57:25.354131

Friends and family wrapped her in hugs and whispered words of encouragement: “One day at a time” and “I’m so glad you’re back.”

The roughly 60-person gathering on Monday marked almost a week since the 38-year-old Greenwood mother returned to her hometown after spending nearly six years in prison for killing her abuser. Now, Carroll hopes to be fully reunited with her children and help other victims of domestic abuse who may share her experiences.
The state parole board, in a 4-2 vote Nov. 19, approved Carroll’s release following a years-long effort by her family, her second grade teacher, and two GOP legislators. She walked out of the women’s prison in Columbia six days later.
Inside the law office of one of Carroll’s supporters, state Rep. John McCravy, well-wishers clutched plates of pink- and red-frosted cake and clasped hands in prayer circles with Carroll as she greeted neighbors she hadn’t seen in years — and even some people she’d never met who prayed for her release.
Because of those efforts, Carroll was able to spend Thanksgiving at her aunt’s home in Simpsonville with her five children — ages 6, 9, 15, 16 and 18 — eating turkey, fried chicken and her grandmother’s specialty macaroni and cheese.
“I just have no words,” Carroll’s aunt Brenda McCullough told the group. “Thanksgiving was so wonderful. The kids were so glad to see each other. It was just like they’d never been apart all this time.”
Carroll spent the Monday after the holiday getting her identification card as she works to have her driver’s license renewed. She starts work Wednesday at Granny Hands and Landis catering company.

Her goal is to have all of her children home with her — hopefully by next summer.
“I just want to get all my kids under the same roof in the same household again,” Carroll told the SC Daily Gazette.
The two youngest children, both boys, live with another family member in Greenwood. Her 18-year-old daughter lives on her own, while her 16- and 15-year-old daughters live with family in Columbia.
Carroll said her daughters visited often while she was incarcerated. She saw the boys just once.
But Carroll feels as if they’ve picked up where they left off, loving her unconditionally. Her oldest daughter reached out and interlinked fingers with her mother as she visited with Greenwood friends she’s been separated from.
Carroll pleaded guilty but mentally ill to manslaughter in December 2019 for fatally stabbing her then-partner, 27-year-old William Jamal Johnson.
Carroll was allowed to spend Christmas Day with her children and turned herself in the next day to begin her 15-year sentence.
Johnson repeatedly physically abused Carroll. Law enforcement officers responded to their home eight times between May 2016 and Johnson’s death, court records show.
She left twice, but as is common in cases of domestic abuse, she returned. She planned to leave again that day in September 2017, when the couple started arguing.

“That day, it was just too late,” Carroll told the Gazette.
At her first parole hearing, Carroll told the board that “he leaped out at me and hit me again.” She’s said she doesn’t remember what happened next. At some point she got a knife from the kitchen, cut him on the arm and ankle and stabbed him in the chest.
After realizing what she’d done, Carroll tried to save Johnson’s life, applying pressure to his wounds. He died at the local hospital.
A month before Carroll’s sentencing, a psychologist diagnosed her with post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder linked to severe domestic violence, also known as “battered woman syndrome.”
At sentencing, then-Circuit Court Judge Letitia Verdin (now a state Supreme Court justice) permitted Carroll to be eligible after serving 25% of her 15-year sentence, leading to the efforts for her release that began in 2022.
While in prison, Carroll said she befriended another woman serving a 30-year sentence with no opportunity for parole for a similar crime.
Carroll said that’s why she wants to start a nonprofit to help other women plead their case for release. She’d also like to work toward changes in state law for battered women, though she’s not yet sure what. And she wants to share with others what she learned in prison programs she enrolled in about recognizing signs of abuse and anger management skills.
“When someone abuses you, they find ways to make you dependent on them, make you feel alone, make you feel like everyone is against you,” she said. “You don’t realize how serious it is.
“I wish I had had that knowledge that I have now,” Carroll added.
In addition to nonprofit work, Carroll also hopes to return to school, taking night classes in business management with the goal of one day opening a daycare.
She said the worst part of prison was being away from her children. She loves being a mother.
“I’m kind of a big kid myself,” she said.
The separation led to sleepless nights and times of lost hope. She said it was faith and the support of her community that helped her get through.
Now out of prison, she said, she refuses to let her time inside define her.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)About 2,000 nurses in four Des Moines area UnityPoint Health campuses will vote early this month on whether to unionize their ranks for what leaders of the movement say will bring more bargaining power for salaries, benefits and working conditions through a proposed affiliation with the Teamsters Union.
Nurses are expected to vote Dec. 7 to 9 on unionization at four UnityPoint locations — Iowa Methodist Medical Center, Blank Children’s Hospital, Methodist West Hospital and Iowa Lutheran Hospital.
An affirmative vote would be a groundbreaking one in Iowa health care — and the union movement — as the Teamsters would represent nurses in non-profit hospitals, with the potential for organizing other health-care workers across a span of UnityPoint facilities in Iowa — and other medical centers in which health-care workers could be inspired by the Des Moines vote.
“We are fed up with UnityPoint whittling away at the things nurses need at the bedside,” said Alex Wilken, 39, a critical care nurse at Iowa Methodist Medical Center with more than a decade of experience.
Wilken is on the organizing committee for unionization with his nursing peers at the four centers.
“It isn’t just about pay,” Wilken said, adding that patient-staff ratios and safer working conditions are a big part of the push for what he believes will be more effective advocacy.
“The method we have here in the United States is to unionize,” Wilken said in a phone interview.
UnityPoint leaders say unionization is not in the best interests of the health-care network. UnityPoint management denied a request this summer for voluntary union recognition in workplace negotiations.
“At UnityPoint Health, we believe that direct collaboration is the foundation for building the strongest and most supportive environment for both our team members and the patients we serve,” UnityPoint officials said in a statement sent to Iowa Mercury. “For this reason, we believe that representation by an outside party is not in the best interests of our patients, our nurses or our community.”
Union organizers are calling for an investigation into how UnityPoint funded any opposition to unionization. Nurses and union officials allege that UnityPoint spent $6 million to fight unionization.
UnityPoint did not respond directly to questions on funding sources for any activity related to the union vote.
Sammi Ladd, 36, a critical care nurse at Iowa Methodist, said health-care workers are concerned that staffing and security levels are not high enough to deal with patient violence. Ladd was attached by a patient while pregnant and kicked a few years later by another patient.
“I’ve seen my co-workers and friends get strangled by patients,” Ladd said.
Ladd expects the nurses to vote for unionization. The vote is managed by the National Labor Relations Board.
“I do truly think this is something that will go through,” Ladd said in an interview. “I do think this something that our community, Iowa, and nurses, deserve.”

Alano De La Rosa, the principal officer for Teamsters Local 90, which includes the Des Moines area and reaches into many other Iowa counties, said nurses will be able to negotiate with the full force of the Teamsters Union behind them. This includes a $400 million national strike fund, he said.
UnityPoint is clearly worried that the union effort with nurses at the four medical centers in the Des Moines could spread to their other facilities and staffing sectors, De La Rosa said.
“I believe it would have been considered by UnityPoint when they started cutting millions of dollars in checks to union busters,” De La Rosa said.
De La Rosa said the Teamsters Union has experience representing nurses and health-care workers.
“They are very big-hearted and they want to help everybody around them,” he said.
The vote is coming two months later than originally scheduled as as the federal government shutdown forced a postponement of a vote that had been set for early October.

In total, the state on Tuesday announced $3.2 million for 18 outdoor infrastructure projects in 13 counties and three tribal communities. According to a news release, interest in the grants has been increasing, with a “record-breaking” 56 applications for the latest FY26 grants, totaling $12.6 million in requests, a 60% increase from the prior round. Of the recipients, 11 received funds for the first time.
The grants include approximately $33,000 to add a kids’ bike pump track in McKinley County via the Navajo Townsite Community Development Corporation. The new track will “support our growing Navajo mountain biking community, and provide a healthy activity to connect our youth to the outdoors,” Navajo Townsite Community Development Corporation Executive Director Prestene Garnenez said in a statement.
Also in McKinley County, the Zuni Youth Enrichment Project received just under $100,000 to renovate nine trailheads, “adding cultural and educational signage from a Zuni perspective,” and to “train a youth trail crew to strengthen connections to the Zuni Pueblo, preserve cultural heritage, and support community wellness.”
Rio Arriba County, in partnership with Pueblo de San Ildefonso, received $85,534 to hire Indigenous youth “to restore and maintain the existing trail system” surrounding Fishing Lake. 
The Rocky Mountain Youth Corps in Taos received the largest award, $500,000, to expand its Individual Placement Program and place 16 young adults in apprenticeships with the Carson, Santa Fe, Gila, and Cibola National Forests and the Valles Caldera National Preserve.
The City of Sunland Park and Grant County each received just under $500,000 to complete phase two of the Rio Grande Trail project and to upgrade the Forks Campground, respectively.
According to an EDD news release, the projects will support 105 jobs and “improve or develop” more than 700 miles of trails in communities across the state. Ten of the projects will receive $2 million from the Land of Enchantment Legacy Fund.
“New Mexicans are proud of their expansive vistas and unique outdoor spaces,” EDD Secretary Rob Black said in a statement. “Communities across New Mexico are eager to improve accessibility and provide safe and beautiful spaces for locals and visitors to get outdoors and enjoy all that New Mexico has to offer.”

Black and Yarborough both represent parts of Nassau and Duval counties. But Black said the civil enforcement provision isn’t being driven by local constituents. It’s left over from the 2023 session, when the original law was passed.
“There were lots of people that were interested in similar language before. That hasn’t stopped, and there’s a steady stream of people that are not letting that go. They still feel that there’s unfinished business there. And Sen. Yarborough and I agree,” Black said.
Existing law
The law defines “conscience-based objection” as one based on a “sincerely held religious, moral, or ethical belief.” And it says that that a health care provider “may not be discriminated against or suffer adverse action” because they declined to participate in or pay for a health care procedure.
The 2023 legislation was hotly debated and closely watched by advocates for gay, transgender, and women’s health care who worry that it gave physicians and payors legal protections to discriminate against patients. It was closely tracked by the Florida Justice Association and insurance companies, in part due to the civil enforcement provisions.
Lawmakers approve measure to allow doctors to withhold care because of ‘conscience’

As initially filed, the 2023 law would have allowed health care providers whose medical conscience rights were violated to file civil suits, as Black and Yarborough are pushing for in the coming session.
But after robust lobbying efforts, 2023 bill sponsor Rep. Joel Rudman offered an amendment to his bill deleting the civil enforcement language. Instead, the Legislature agreed to a regulatory scheme that required health care providers and insurance companies that allege their rights have been violated to file complaints with the Attorney General’s Office. If that office determines the law has been violated, the office can file a civil suit.










What we're aware of is there are people in the medical community who are concerned about not having the protections that the new bill would afford them.


– Rep. Dean Black


The law authorizes the AG’s office to take depositions; make inspections; issue and serve subpoenas; compel the attendance of witnesses; and require the production of books, papers, documents, and other evidence while investigating the complaints.
It’s not clear how many providers have filed complaints with the AG’s office, which did not immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for information.
Black noted the existing law permits, but doesn’t require, the AG’s office to file civil suits for substantiated complaints and described enforcement efforts to date as “nebulous.”
But Black also stressed that the legislation isn’t about Attorney General James Uthmeier’s performance. Instead, it’s about ensuring people have protections under the law, regardless of who is elected AG of Florida, he said.
‘Put the power in the hands of health care providers’
The 2026 legislation wouldn’t unravel the complaint process, delete the AG’s ability to investigate alleged violations, or strip the AG’s ability to file civil litigation. But it would allow those who filed complaints to move ahead with their own civil suits if the AG’s office hasn’t acted within six months.
“What we’re aware of is there are people in the medical community who are concerned about not having the protections that the new bill would afford them. You’re relying upon the AG, which right now the AG might really jump on that energetically if there was a violation of existing law,” Black said.
“But who’s to say who the AG would be in future years? And never mind that. We also just think it’s a good idea to put the power in the hands of the health care providers and let them avail themselves of remedies under the civil justice system,” Black said.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/02/ct-tax-cuts/,"With the next election less than 12 months away, the 2026 General Assembly session could be swamped with tax-cutting ideas from both parties.","Republicans have staunchly defended unprecedented state efforts in recent years to shrink Connecticut’s massive legacy of pension debt, even though it’s leached billions from education, health care and other core programs in the process.
But the GOP has begun to modify that stance, willing to scale back that effort if — and only if — those dollars go back to middle-class households in the form of big tax cuts.
Citing high energy costs, inflation above federal targets and Congress cutting deeply into human services, Republicans say Connecticut families need more help badly now, but not through new state programs.
And with many Democrats already renewing their push for a new child-based income tax cut and the next state election less than 12 months away, the 2026 General Assembly session could be swamped with tax-cutting ideas.
GOP: CT households must benefit directly from big surpluses
“For my constituents, it’s about over-taxation,” House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said during a floor debate last month. “We are seeing billions and billions of dollars flow into our coffers.”
The GOP leader was referring to the aggressive series of state budget caps that have generated unprecedented surpluses averaging more than $1.8 billion, or 8% to 9% of the General Fund, every year since 2017. About $4 billion from those bounties has been used to bolster budget reserves, but the bulk, about $10 billion, has been dedicated to whittling down the massive pension debt Connecticut amassed over seven decades prior to 2011.
The primary beneficiaries of those payments, Candelora said, involve tens of thousands of state employees, municipal teachers and retirees from those two fields.
“But what about the other 3.4 million people, the people that are telling us we can’t afford to continue to pay property taxes in the state of Connecticut?” he added. “I think we need to start looking at the people that are slipping into poverty, slipping into need, because everything in the state of Connecticut has become unaffordable.”
In late October, House Republicans called for a $700 increase in the state income tax credit that covers a portion of households’ municipal property tax bills.
With the potential to restore $500 million annually, all to the middle class, it would rival the 2023 income tax cuts ordered by Gov. Ned Lamont and the Democratic-controlled General Assembly for the most generous relief package in state history.
But it also would mean this fiscal year’s projected surplus — another big windfall projected at $2 billion — would be about 25% smaller. That means less to pay down pension debt, which still exceeds $33 billion, according to Lamont’s budget office, and isn’t projected to be eliminated until the mid-2040s.
But Candelora said Connecticut could afford a big tax cut and still make big annual inroads on its debt problem. The $10 billion in surplus funds its deposited into the pensions since 2020 were in addition to the more than $3 billion in required payments Connecticut makes annually through regular budgeting. Prior to 2020, Connecticut never had contributed surplus to its pensions.
And since Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the legislature already have diverted some funds away from surplus and into new spending, why couldn’t Republicans deflect some to cut taxes on households in need, the North Branford lawmaker added.
Lamont and Democrats dedicated $300 million from last fiscal year’s surplus to launch a new program to expand affordable child care. That initiative also has a claim on a portion of future surpluses.
And despite repeated warnings that Medicaid costs were exploding, Democrats underfunded the program by $284 million last fiscal year, effectively leaving the problem to be solved using surplus dollars.
“I think I’ve been dragged into this conversation unwillingly by the Democrats,” Candelora added.
House Republicans likely won’t be alone in supporting tax cuts.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, has “serious concerns” about redirecting any funds away from paying down a pension debt, but “if we’re going to do anything [else] with those funds … it needs to be returned to [households] in the form of tax relief.”
The GOP’s two gubernatorial contenders, former New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart and state Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich, both agreed Connecticut can help its middle class and save diligently to reduce debt.
Given the huge budget surpluses Connecticut has reported since 2017, “it’s hard to not ask the question: Are we being overtaxed?” Stewart said.
And while she praised the bipartisan legislative effort eight years ago that helped Connecticut save more, stop tax hikes, and begin reducing debt, the former mayor added it’s still too expensive for many to live here.
“I see that every day,” she added. “Often times, both parents are working and they’re just scrounging by.”
“At some point, middle-class taxpayers are the forgotten people of Connecticut,” Fazio said, adding relief would provide an economic assist as well. “All the evidence suggests that income tax cuts spur more economic growth than other forms of tax cuts.”
Democrats have their own tax-cutting ideas
Republicans also won’t be the only ones putting tax-cut proposals on the table.
Many progressive and moderate Democrats in the General Assembly have been pushing for the past four years to create a permanent state income tax credit for low- and middle-income households with children.
The most popular plan, raised back in 2021 by then-Rep. Sean Scanlon, a Guilford Democrat who now serves as state comptroller, would provide $600 per child, up to $1,800 per household.
The United Way of Connecticut, another leader in the fight for a state child tax credit, vowed to continue the battle in September when it released its latest affordability analysis, showing a record-high 581,000 Connecticut households, about 40%, couldn’t afford a basic “survival” budget.
The United Way estimates it cost a family of four — two parents and two children — $116,000 to cover basic survival needs, including food, housing, utilities, child and health care and transportation in 2023.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said the governor “will listen to any ideas that reduce taxes, increase taxpayers and make our state a more attractive place to live and work.”
Rep. Maria Horn, D-Salisbury, co-chairwoman of the tax-writing Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, said this week she anticipates many state tax relief proposals aimed at the middle class in the next session, especially since the GOP-led Congress focused the bulk of federal tax cuts it ordered last July on the nation’s wealthiest households.
“That creates a structure where the very wealthy are receiving a tax benefit and the middle and less privileged classes are not,” she said.
Can CT afford to cut taxes and bolster human services?
But both Horn and House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, warn frequently that any tax cuts must be sustainable. In other words, don’t promise so much relief it must be scaled back one year later if the economy slips.
And state legislators are more worried about budget stability now than perhaps any other time since they installed new caps eight years ago. That’s because Congress ordered more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other human service programs to help finance federal tax relief.
Connecticut expects to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in annual federal assistance, although the bulk of those cutbacks likely won’t take effect until 2027 or 2028.
Rep. Josh Elliott of Hamden, a progressive who is challenging Lamont for the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial nomination, said many lawmakers still want to put more dollars directly into working families’ hands.
But Elliott, a founder of the legislature’s Tax Equity Caucus, added tax relief is a good tool — but not the only one — to help families.
It does a family little good to save $700 on state income taxes if Connecticut cuts municipal aid so much that same household faces an $800 increase in town property taxes.
Similarly, it state budget policies drive up community college tuition, slash rental and winter energy assistance and ignore rising health insurance costs, then tax cuts help little or not at all.
“It’s not one or the other,” Elliott said. “It seems that there’s a hypocrisy on the part of the Republicans that they are only willing to affect [costs] with tax cuts.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0128_SR_GrantPauseConference654-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 13:57:25.354131

Under federal law, when a parent or teacher refers a child for a possible disability, the district must complete an evaluation, often within a 90-day window. But the complaint, filed in the Eastern District of North Carolina, alleges the school district routinely stalled these evaluations by requiring students to first complete the “Multi-Tiered System of Support,” a schoolwide intervention program meant to help struggling students before they fall behind. MTSS is not a special education service, and federal law does not permit districts to use it to delay or deny an evaluation.
According to the complaint, the practice left children waiting months, sometimes more than a year, for assessments they were legally entitled to receive much sooner.
The lawsuit was brought by Cynthia Lee, a former teacher at Sherwood Park Elementary School, and three former second-grade students identified as R.S., D.C. and J.M. They say Cumberland County Schools unlawfully used the MTSS program as a “gatekeeper,” blocking or postponing evaluations even after parents submitted written referrals. The complaint also says the district failed to give parents required notices when it declined to move forward with an evaluation.
In a statement, Cumberland County Schools said it was aware of the lawsuit but does not comment on pending litigation. The district said it “remains committed to supporting students with disabilities and working with families in accordance with applicable state and federal law,” and is reviewing the complaint with its legal counsel.
Lee alleges she repeatedly alerted administrators that the students showed signs of disabilities and needed prompt evaluations. She says that as she continued raising concerns, school administrators became hostile.
After Lee filed a formal complaint with the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction on April 30, 2025, she says she was confronted in staff meetings, publicly criticized and eventually forced to resign at the end of the school year.
According to the lawsuit, the Department of Public Instruction investigated Lee’s complaint and found that Cumberland County Schools had violated IDEA’s Child Find, which requires schools to identify and evaluate any child who may have a disability. The state described the district’s practices as “systemic.”
The complaint does not specify how the district responded to those findings.
The lawsuit also names DPI, arguing the state failed to enforce federal disability law and allowed districts, including Cumberland County, to use MTSS in ways that delayed legally required evaluations.
NCDPI said it had not yet been served with the lawsuit and could not comment.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/AdobeStock_disability400.jpg,,,2025-12-02 12:57:31.525588

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The University of Alabama suspended publication of two student-run magazines on Monday, claiming that the publications were not in compliance with federal guidance on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. 
UA officials Monday evening told members of Alice, a magazine focused on female undergraduates, and Nineteen Fifty-Six, a magazine focused on Black undergraduates, that they would stop publishing, citing their interpretation of a July memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi, which makes non-binding recommendations on compliance with anti-DEI policies supported by the Trump administration.
“I was under the impression that we were protected from being affected by any anti-DEI legislation and rulings because of our First Amendment right to freedom of press, but it appears I was wrong,” Alice Magazine Editor-in-Chief Gabrielle Gunter said in a statement Tuesday.

Alex House, an associate director of communications at UA, said in a statement Tuesday the suspension of both magazines was to “ensure all members of our community feel welcome to participate in programs that receive university funding from the Office of Student Media.”
Nineteen Fifty-Six Magazine Founder Tionna Taite said in a statement Tuesday that the publications are needed at the university to highlight minority voices. 
“Truly both 1956 Magazine and Alice are pivotal to the minority experience at UA. I am beyond disappointed in the regression UA has made since I created 1956 Magazine,” Taite said. “In 2020, UA made promises to be more diverse, inclusive and equitable. Five years later, I do not see any progress and their decision regarding both magazines confirms this.”
While both publications were geared toward specific demographics, all students could apply to work for the magazines. Bondi’s memo did not include any specific guidance on student-run publications serving particular communities.
“These were spaces for marginalized students to create work that reflected their lived experiences,” Gunter said.
The news was first reported by the Crimson White, the university’s student-run newspaper.
Alice Magazine, started in 2015, was the university’s women’s magazine writing about topics including lifestyle, health and wellness. Nineteen Fifty-Six reported on the university’s Black culture and lifestyle. 
The University of Alabama has been dismantling spaces that serve marginalized communities on the campus over the last year and a half. After the Alabama Legislature passed SB 129 in March 2024, banning publicly-funded diversity, equity and inclusion programs and so-called “divisive concepts,” the university closed two dedicated spaces for the Black Student Union office and the Safe Zone, a space for LGBTQ+ students.
In a filing in a federal lawsuit over SB 129 this summer, attorneys for UA claimed that reopening the spaces would constitute “unlawful discrimination,“ citing the Bondi memo. Attorneys for students and educators challenging SB 129 rejected the assertion, noting the Bondi memo was non-binding and that the spaces were open to all students, regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation.
Marie McMullan, the leader of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) Student Press Freedom Initiative said the organization is currently investigating the incident, calling it “deeply concerning” and “a blow to the student press in Tuscaloosa.”
“The university’s decisions must respect the First Amendment rights of student publications like Alice and Nineteen Fifty-Six,” McMullan said in a statement Tuesday.
A petition was started on MoveOn to reinstate both magazines saying the suspension is “a direct attack on free speech on a college campus and must be combated by all students.” As of late Tuesday morning, it had over 900 signatures.

Ben Smaltz, R-Auburn, introduces his congressional redistricting bill during committee on Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The author of Indiana’s new congressional redistricting bill acknowledged the maps are “politically gerrymandered” during committee questioning Tuesday but defended the proposal against accusations of illegal racial gerrymandering.
The maps, released Monday morning, were drawn “purely for political performance” of Republicans, Rep. Ben Smaltz told indignant Democratic colleagues.
The current districts, drawn by the GOP in 2021, are 7-2 in favor of Republicans. The House and Senate GOP worked with the National Republican Redistricting Trust to engineer a likely 9-0 sweep of the districts ahead of the 2026 midterms.
“They’re politically gerrymandered, if you’d like to say that,” Smaltz, R-Auburn, said.
He was adamant that no racial information was used in crafting House Bill 1032.

The targeted districts now held by Democratic Reps. André Carson and Frank Mrvan are by far Indiana’s most racially diverse. The maps split Carson’s district, which largely overlaps Marion County borders, four ways, and halves Mrvan’s.
“You’re okay with … racially gerrymandered maps if you get your desired outcome for … politically gerrymandered maps?” asked Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis.
“We didn’t look at that, at any of that,” Smaltz replied.
He faced more than an hour of intense questioning from Democrats on the House Elections and Apportionment Committee on Tuesday, which also featured ominous testimony from Marion County’s elections chief and a prominent Republican.
It was the House’s only hearing on the maps, held with less than a day of notice. A committee vote is expected sometime today.
‘Chaos’ incoming, clerk says
Local election officials typically have a year before an election to make redistricting-related adjustments, Marion County Clerk Kate Sweeney Bell told the committee.
If approved next week as planned, clerks would have a matter of months before the May 5 primary election.
She detailed the complex updates required to reassign the likely hundreds of thousands of impacted Indianapolis voters, retrain thousands of poll workers, update public communications and more — all on a smaller budget.
Precinct splits backed into the bill present further “administrative burden.”
“If any of this is done incorrectly, voters are going to feel the impact when they come to vote,” the clerk said.
She urged lawmakers to reject the proposal, adding, “If it passes, there will be chaos. Chaos in clerk’s offices around the state. Chaos when candidates file at the election board. … That’s exactly what election administrators want to avoid.”
More than 20 witnesses spoke in opposition to the proposal by mid-day, including retired Ivy Tech Community College Sue Ellspermann. The Republican previously served as lieutenant governor under former Gov. Mike Pence, and as a House lawmaker.
“We have fair maps. The ones we have performed — some might say over-performed — for the Republican majority,” she said. “The plea to redraw Indiana’s map is coming out of Washington, D.C. Some may argue that they have the right to ask, and in that case, we certainly have the right to answer, ‘No.'”

She reminded lawmakers — including former colleagues amid 2011 redistricting — that they pledged to “serve all Hoosiers, not just those who voted for us or the current president” in their oath of office.
Hoosiers “have a reputation for standing up to political pressure,” Ellspermann added, lauding Pence for his refusal to overturn the 2020 election.
Just two witnesses had spoken in favor of the maps by midday: Paul Logemann, an Indiana resident and lobbyist with D.C.-based Heritage Action and Indianapolis resident Nathan Roberts.
Logemann pushed legislators to advance the maps, saying they “reflect the will of Hoosiers and ensure that Hoosier voices are not diluted in Congress.”
California, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and Utah have already heeded — or countered — President Donald Trump’s call for more GOP U.S. House seats.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Federal funds previously held up in the government shutdown are now available to help Mainers heat their homes. 
On Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins announced that nearly $40 million is now available to help low-income Mainers, seniors and tribal members in the state afford their energy bills this winter. More than $1.4 million of that is allocated specifically for the Indian Township and Pleasant Point Passamaquoddy, Penobscot, Maliseet and Mi’kmaq tribes.
The money is part of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Republicans, like Collins, and Democrats in Congress have been urging for these dollars to be made quickly available after the government reopened in late November. 
“LIHEAP funding provides vital relief to thousands of Mainers, helping them avoid the constant worry of having to choose between heating their homes and covering other basic necessities,” Collins said in a news release Tuesday. 
Home heating costs are estimated to rise on average nearly 8% compared to last winter, according to national forecasts. Costs for heating with electricity are expected to increase even more, with estimates at about 10% higher than last year.
Golden pushes for quick release of heating assistance delayed by shutdown

U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, a Democrat who represents Maine’s 2nd Congressional District, recently signed onto a letter asking Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to distribute the funds by Nov. 30. Bipartisan senators, including Collins and independent Sen. Angus King, similarly sent a letter to HHS last month calling for the assistance to be released.
States usually receive LIHEAP allocations in early November to help roughly 6 million Americans, including 45,000 Mainers, heat their homes, but this year’s money was delayed because of the government shutdown that proved to be the longest in history. 
The Maine State Housing Authority came up with a temporary solution after it was made clear states would not receive LIHEAP funding on the usual timeline, using leftover funds from two other programs to avoid heating emergencies. However, they knew it wouldn’t be a long-term fix.

The Senate has consistently resisted the idea. (Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/New Jersey Monitor)A measure (HB 133) that would lower the age to purchase a long gun in Florida from 21 to 18 years old passed its second and final committee in the state House on Tuesday and will hit the floor when the 2026 session opens, where for the fourth year in a row it is expected to pass in the GOP-controlled chamber.
However, a companion bill in the Senate has yet to been filed, putting the measure in jeopardy of failure. A similar situation has played out durin the past three legislative sessions, with the measure passing the House and dying in the Senate.
The proposal is sponsored by Rep. Tyler Sirois, R-Brevard County.
The majority of public speakers who came before the House Judiciary Committee opposed the measure, many of them students who invoked the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. That incident, which killed 17 students and instructors, led to the raising the age to purchase a long gun to 21 as part of a larger comprehensive gun safety package signed into law by Republican Gov. Rick Scott.
“Allowing teenagers to buy high-powered weapons and carry them without a permit in a state without permitless carry is not freedom,” said Jacob Lombardo, a senior at the University of Central Florida. “It is a threat to every student and every family in this great state.”
The only proponents of the measure were individuals representing Second Amendment organizations.
“Right now in Florida, 18- to 20-year-olds can legally carry a firearm. They can even open-carry a firearm. But they cannot legally purchase one,” said Jed Carroll of Gun Owners of America. “That means their right to self-defense exists only if someone else buys the firearm for them. And let’s be honest — that only works for young adults that come from families with the means to provide it.”

There have been 234 reported cases of influenza this season, which generally runs from fall through winter. Those cases have resulted in six hospitalizations.
“In Missoula County and nationwide, hospitalization rates are increasing for respiratory illnesses, including the flu and COVID-19,” a press release said. “Getting vaccinated remains the best tool along with basic prevention measures to protect everyone in the community from respiratory illnesses.”
Flu symptoms include high fever, chills, headaches, exhaustion, sore throat, cough and body aches. It can take several days after being exposed to the virus for symptoms to develop. Additionally, flu can spread one day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick.
Health officials are also tracking clusters and moving forward with their disease surveillance programs. 
“The Montana Public Health Laboratory is ramping up influenza surveillance to track statewide activity, circulating strains, and antiviral resistance,” a DPHHS press release stated. “This year’s program mirrors last season, with 14 hospital labs submitting two specimens weekly and 33 additional labs receiving fee-waived tests for confirmation.”
Health officials are encouraging everyday precautions to stop the spread of influenza including:

Getting vaccinated.
Wearing a mask if you are sick and need to go out in public.
Covering your nose and mouth with a tissue or your elbow when you cough or sneeze.
Washing hands often with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
Avoiding close contact with people who are sick.
Staying home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone, unless you medical care or necessities.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1463564287-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 12:57:31.525588

Sheldon Timothy Herrington Jr., the son of a prominent family from Grenada, pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree murder and evidence tampering for hiding Lee’s body in a wooded gully in Carroll County near his parents’ home. 
Lafayette County Circuit Judge Kelly Luther accepted the prosecution’s recommendation for Herrington to receive a total sentence of 40 years to serve with an additional 10 years of post-release supervision.
Lee’s family, friends, Oxford police officers and even some university officials attended the sentencing hearing Tuesday. Herrington’s parents also sat in the audience, his side of the courtroom more populated than during the first trial.
Before Luther handed down the sentence, Lee’s father, Jimmie Lee Sr., addressed the court. Stephanie Lee stood behind him. The parents have rarely spoken publicly throughout the process. Jimmie Lee Sr. said he was a “broken father” and he reminded Herrington that Lee had trusted him.

“I’m here to give a message and just let Herrington know,” the father and pastor said. “Hell will put you in order. Heaven will put you out.”
Jimmie Lee reminded him of God’s redemptive plan: “You don’t have to go to hell.”
The father said he knew from the beginning that Herrington killed his son. He prayed for healing. He said his family has been living July 8, 2022 — the day Lee went missing — since that day.
“I had to witness my son’s skeletal remains. I touched his skull,” he said. “No father should have to go through that. No parent should have to go through that.”
When Judge Luther spoke, he praised the handling of the case.
“Mississippi got it right in this case. This case was investigated more thoroughly than any other case I have dealt with in my 35 years in this criminal justice system. It was defended … as well as any case I have dealt with in my 35 years. Everybody did their job,” he said.
Herrington did not speak at the hearing. His attorney, Aafram Sellers, said Herrington did not tell him why he killed Lee. The plea was ultimately Herrington’s decision, Sellers said, adding that redemption “starts with accepting responsibility.”
“We don’t see our lives going down these paths and that is what happened,” Sellers said. “… Both families have to go through that grieving process.”
The prosecution said it had not expected a plea deal. It came Monday as the court was selecting jurors in Madison County due to a concern that it would not be possible to seat an unbiased jury from Lafayette County. 
The first trial in 2024 ended in a mistrial. Action News 5 reported that one of the 12 jurors refused to convict Herrington because of the absence of Lee’s body. 
Earlier this year, Lee’s remains were found in a dumping ground in Carroll County. Prosecutors then indicted Herrington a second time.
Lee’s disappearance sparked a movement in Oxford called “Justice for Jay Lee.” His friends held protests outside the courthouse, tailgated at football games and ran a social media page.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia MercuryAs Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger prepares to take the helm of the state of Virginia, she has announced her pick for the next secretary of health and human resources: Marvin Figueroa. 
A veteran senior official of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Figueroa previously served as the Deputy HHS secretary under former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam. Figueroa was also a health policy advisor to U.S. Sen. Mark Warner and helped craft the CHRONIC Care Act — a 2018 law that bolstered Medicare coverage of services for people with chronic conditions. Most recently, Figueroa was vice president at BGR Group, a bipartisan lobbying and communications firm in D.C. 
The state’s HHR secretary oversees a dozen state agencies — to include the Departments of Health, Social Services and Medical Assistance Services. The role is paramount to helping gubernatorial administrations carry out their agendas regarding public health. 
“As Governor, I am committed to making sure our neighbors have access to safe, reliable healthcare and are served by leaders who are ready to tackle the tough challenges ahead,” Spanberger said in a statement. “I know that Mr. Figueroa will always put the health and safety of Virginians first — and I look forward to working alongside him to deliver affordable, accessible care for every Virginian.”
Spanberger’s administration and state lawmakers will have to navigate a shifting national landscape of federal health funding along with forthcoming changes to Medicaid eligibility and hospital funding mechanisms in the years ahead. Outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin had already reserved some of the state’s budget surplus as “cushion” earlier this year to cover some of the funding gaps created by Congress and President Donald Trump’s actions. For instance, the reconciliation bill passed this summer, for the first time, shifts financial responsibility for several public health programs to states.
“The challenges are real. Families are feeling the strain of rising costs, uneven access to care, and systems that are too often hard to navigate,” Figueroa said in a statement. “I share the Governor-elect’s commitment to meet these issues with the urgency Virginians deserve. I am ready to work with the General Assembly, our agencies, and partners across the Commonwealth to strengthen the systems communities rely on and to deliver progress people can feel in their daily lives.”
More access, less cost: Spanberger lays out health care plans if she wins Virginia governorship

Addressing health care affordability and access issues was a pillar of Spanberger’s campaign for governor. She pledged support for a forthcoming reform to create a single state-contracted pharmacy benefit manager position to handle Medicaid in Virginia. The move, supporters say, would improve accountability, lower costs and help independent pharmacies stay afloat. 
Other public health changes that could be on the horizon under Spanberger’s administration include creating a statewide hospital price transparency comparison tool to help people weigh options for treatments and drugs. She may collaborate with Attorney General-elect Jay Jones on consumer protection laws, and a push for Virginia’s pharmaceutical manufacturing industry to ramp up generic drug production. 
Spanberger also said earlier this year that Virginia’s network of free and charitable clinics can count on her support for funding boosts in coming budget cycles. As shifting federal policy can cause thousands of Virginians to lose their health insurance, clinics have been bracing for increased needs in their local communities.

Sensory exercises like this are often used in special education classrooms. (Getty Images)Tuesday marks fifty years since the Individual with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, was signed into law by President Gerald Ford, and education advocates and parents of children with disabilities are saying that the support provided in Michigan is not enough. 
Elizabeth Wilson Fischer, the mother of three young children with autism, two of whom also have ADHD, pulled her two oldest children out of their public school in Forest Hills, just outside of Grand Rapids, after receiving what she described as inadequate support, including refusal from school administrators to provide needed accommodations like 504 plans, which are established sets of instructions to teachers and school administrators to assist students with disabilities. 
The situation became traumatic, she said, especially for her oldest son, Francis. 
“I was dragging him into school. He wasn’t making friends. He was having conflict at recess or at school, so his self confidence and self worth started deteriorating,” she said. “He’d come home and we would just be managing meltdowns, basically because he was so upset and distraught and stressed out from school.”
Even though his individual teachers were generally supportive of his accommodations, without more formal support structures from administrators, the situation became too severe. Now, both of Fischer’s older children attend a private, nontraditional school in their area — meaning that the family has to pay tuition costs as well.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“I would love to have seen some more proactive measures being put into place, because really, they wait for the kids to struggle before they come in and help,” Fischer said of the public school system. 
Stories like Francis’s are not rare in Michigan, according to a report submitted to state legislators at the end of October that detailed the issues that the state faces in funding for special education. 










Our current system is inadequate, inequitable, and too often creates disincentives for schools to provide needed services to students with disabilities.


– David Arsen, a professor emeritus of education policy and educational administration at Michigan State University


That report, the Michigan Special Education Finance Reform Blueprint, explains that though the number of students with disabilities is now nearly 15% of Michigan’s public school population, their educational outcomes are lacking. Less than 60% of those students graduate on time, and nearly 14% drop out of high school. 
“Special education funding is among the most important and pressing areas in need of reform. Our current system is inadequate, inequitable, and too often creates disincentives for schools to provide needed services to students with disabilities,” David Arsen, a professor emeritus of education policy and educational administration at Michigan State University, writes in the report’s foreword. “In most cases, students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) represent a net financial loss to their schools, with the financial burden increasing as student needs grow more complex.”
As the system stands in Michigan, school districts have to submit special education expense reports to the state, who will reimburse a portion of the expenses — just over 28% for operational costs and around 70% for specialized transportation costs. 
It also notes that under the current system, local property taxes and wealth determine how much money a school has for special education, “resulting in underfunding for lower-wealth districts and compelling schools to allocate general fund dollars to meet mandated services.” 
But even in wealthier towns and districts, support is lacking. In Forest Hills, where the Fischers live, the median income is over $156,000, according to Census Bureau data, around double the median income of the state overall. And for most families, the cost to send students to specialized or nontraditional private schools would be too high for it to be a reasonable option, often totalling thousands of dollars per year.
Federal funding is also lacking — the National Education Association explains that when the Individual with Disabilities Education Act was passed, federal funding was supposed to cover 40% of the average per pupil cost for special education. Nationally, that number is less than 12%, and in Michigan, the funding gap is over $919 million. 
Instead, the Blueprint report advocates for what is known as a Weighted Student Funding formula, where students who need higher levels of support in special education have higher funding levels allocated to their districts. The system would build on Michigan’s per-pupil allowances, which are appropriated each year in the budget — in fiscal year 2026, that number stands at $10,050. The proposed system would add money in four tiers, increasing the per-pupil allowance for students with special education needs by a certain weight depending on the needs of the student. 
Fischer emphasized that these supports are necessary for students with disabilities, like her children, to succeed in school — as well as to allow other students and teachers to be able to have a classroom environment conducive to learning. 
“Parents aren’t looking for 504s for fun for their medically diagnosed ADHD, autistic children. They were born 30 steps back,” she said. “This isn’t a leg up.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-1088179758-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 11:58:35.915865

One of them is North Stonington, Connecticut.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Laura Tillman to discuss her article, “A chemist, a chef and an author craft soy sauce on the CT coast,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Laura’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Laura, you were intrigued when you found out that Moromi soy sauce is manufactured in North Stonington, Connecticut. How did you find that out?
LT: I think I was just doing some reading. I wrote a story last year about chef Jacques Pepin. And I’m always really interested in what’s going on in food. I had spent a number of years before this working on a book about a chef, so that’s just a topic that I’m interested in. I think I was kind of on the hunt for another interesting, quirky kind of food story based in Connecticut.
WSHU: And so you come across this sauce, and then how do you go about telling the story? Because Bob Florence seems like a fantastic character.
LT: Yeah, he’s done a number of interviews. So I read up on, you know, what he had discussed about this journey. And then I got to go to the Moromi brewery. The factories making soy sauce are referred to as breweries. I came to learn and interviewed him there, and got to sample some of the different Moromi products. And yeah, he has had an amazingly interesting journey up to this point. I think in a lot of ways, when you hear what his story is, it makes total sense that he’s making soy sauce now. But he, you know, started out in industrial plastics, selling these plastics, having lived in Detroit and working for the car manufacturing industry at a time when manufacturers were replacing a lot of these kinds of clunky, heavy metal parts in cars with plastics to improve mileage. And so he ended up doing a lot of business in Japan and his career, and because of that,he went to Japan, ate a lot of great food in Japan, learned about soy sauce, which in Japan is shoyu. And then, you know, many years later, after he had moved to Mystic, he started thinking about another business idea and also a hobby of making his own soy sauce at home.
WSHU: But before he got to the soy sauce, he had another project that he had worked on; trying to make fuel, right?
LT: Yeah, fuel from algae through a fermentation process, and that project was scientifically successful, but it didn’t end up being a profitable business at the time. So that kind of linked his experience with manufacturing, his experience with chemistry, and his experience with fermentation altogether, which are kind of like these key elements to having a successful time making soy sauce and manufacturing it.
WSHU: Now, tell us a little bit about soy sauce. What is it?
LT: So there’s a process by which this mold called koji is added to soy beans and to wheat, or it could also be rye berries, and the mold kind of eats at these ingredients and then ferments. And so that mash of ingredients, once the koji has had time to inoculate the soybeans and the wheat are put into barrels in a mash, and that mash starts to ferment, and it’s kind of producing this kind of slow motion Maillard reaction, which is the same process when you’re cooking and heating something, and basically, proteins and sugars are being heated. So over time, you know. It creates this substance that really kind of lights up your mouth when you’re eating it. Through this other partner in the business, James Wayman, who’s a chef based on the Connecticut coast, I learned a little about his experience with koji and with soy sauce and kind of how he views it as a really critical component to taking his food to the next level.
WSHU: Now, James Wayman is another person involved in this, and he happens to be a chef.
LT: Yes, so James was when he met Bob Florence, he was the head chef at Oyster Club, the acclaimed restaurant, and then he ended up separating off and founding Nana’s, which has locations in Mystic and Westerly, Rhode Island. And Nana’s is kind of an all-day cafe. They call it a bakery. They also have pizza, rotisserie chicken, and specials. So there’s a lot going on in their menu. And when Bob Florence and James Wayman met, Bob Florence asked James Wayman to just try the soy sauce that he was making. I think for him, it was kind of like, you know, he was making this thing as a pet project, but it would mean a lot to him to have a chef like James taste it and just give him his thoughts. And immediately, James Wayman put it on the menu at the Oyster Club and called it Bob Florence soy sauce. And at the time, you know, it takes about a year to brew one of these barrels of soy sauce.
WSHU: Wow, that’s long.
LT: Yeah. So for Bob Florence, he wasn’t kind of ready to scale up that quickly. He was like, Do I really have enough of this stuff to be putting it on a menu of a restaurant? But over time, they decided to go into business together to make this together.
WSHU: Now, tell us about the third person in this story, Debbi Florence.
LT: So Debbie is Bob Florence’s wife. She is a Japanese American children’s book author, and so she has also written some great children’s books about Japanese food, specifically a picture book biography of a Michelin-starred chef named Nikki Nakayama. But yeah, so the three of them went into this business together.
WSHU: Now the Moromi brand can be found in restaurants across the country.
LT: Yeah, and you can also buy it on their website. You can also go to Nana’s and buy it, and a number of other places carry it in the Mystic area, restaurants, and other gourmet shops.
WSHU: This is really a specialty item.
LT: Yeah, I will say, since I visited, I bought a bottle of it, and I have started using it. My kids have very expensive tastes, as their favorite food is sushi. Once in a while, we get sushi, and we’ll use the Moromi soy sauce. And I really do think that it adds complexity and, really, it adds to the experience of eating something like that.
WSHU: Well, it’s fascinating how these things happen. And one of the few manufacturers of soy sauce in the U.S. is located right here in Connecticut.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1010_SR_NanasMystic_063-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 15:58:57.102764

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Tom Witt said he began fielding calls about 15 minutes after Kansas Reflector published a story on Democratic Sen. Mary Ware’s retirement from the Legislature.
Witt, best known as a former executive director of Equality Kansas, walked away from the Statehouse in 2022 after 18 years of fiercely guarding LGBTQ+ rights. He has remained off the radar and wasn’t interested in returning to the public stage — “Oh, hell no,” he said in an interview — but the calls kept coming.
“At first,” he said, “I was telling people, ‘You’re out of your minds. I’m not interested in doing this.’ Just because, reflexively, my answer for the past three years, when people have asked me if I want to get back in, in one way or another, my reflexive answer has been, “No, I’m retired — and quit asking.”
But, he added, “some very serious people in Democratic politics” told him he should join the list of candidates to become Ware’s successor.
Democratic precinct committee members on Thursday will choose Ware’s replacement for the Wichita seat. Rep. Silas Miller is another candidate. Neither Miller nor former Wichita Mayor Brandon Whipple, who is considered by political observers to be another possibility, returned a call from Kansas Reflector seeking comment for this story.
Witt has lived in the Senate district for more than 30 years and worked on campaigns for Ware and other Democrats from the area who were elected to the state House and Senate.
He said his knowledge of the district, experience with the legislative process and willingness to speak up, loudly, make him a strong candidate for the seat.
There won’t be a learning curve, he said.
“I know my way in and out,” Witt said. “I know every rule, procedure, process, custom. I probably know more about how to work in the Senate than a lot of the newer senators do.”
“Where people will have a really mixed opinion on whether I should be in this seat or not: I’m not known for my silence,” he added. “I have strong opinions, and I am very happy to share them with any legislator, whether they’re on my side or they’re an opponent. I’m not going to hold back. And there’s a lot of people that think we need more of that in the Senate Democratic caucus.”
If chosen for the position, Witt said, his top issues would be protecting public education, tax fairness, and supporting rural hospitals and family farms.
“I’m known for LGBT advocacy,” he said. “It just goes with my territory here. But that’s not going to be my sole focus. It can’t be my sole focus. There’s 75,000 people in this district, and they all deserve representation.”
He is also concerned with firearm safety.
Witt said that while he carries a concealed firearm himself, “I also think that anybody who carries a firearm outside their home needs to be vetted and trained and permitted.”
Miller is serving his second term in the House, where he is the ranking Democrat on the Federal and State Affairs Committee. He announced his interest in Ware’s seat through a post on his campaign Facebook page.
“I’ve loved my time serving in the Kansas House and getting to know Sen. Ware both as a colleague and a human,” Miller wrote. “She is a fantastic person and I know that she has big shoes to fill.
“After a lot of contemplation, I’ve decided to announce that I intend to seek the nomination to represent Senate District 25 at the upcoming convention.”
Ware announced her retirement Nov. 13 and didn’t state a reason. She was appointed to the position after former Sen.

The winners — Bally’s Corporation in The Bronx, and Metropolitan Park and Resorts World in Queens — now advance to the final round of approvals before they can officially begin building and operating their gaming facilities.
The New York Gaming Facility Location Board, a group appointed by the State Gaming Commission to oversee the evaluation process of the new, fully licensed casinos, met at the CUNY Graduate Center in Manhattan for the penultimate step of the downstate casino licensure process.
The board assessed each applicant on their proposed casino’s economic benefit, job creation, diversity initiatives, and impact to the local community. Each of the three casinos has estimated billions of dollars in revenue, and the state is hoping it will boost its own coffers. The state has already factored an estimated $2 billion in revenue from the projects into the MTA’s budget through 2029. 
“The board’s decision was constrained by the specific criteria of the legislative study… in response to a vote of the people of New York State to support the licensure of the casino gambling in the state,” said board chair Vicki L. Been. “Within that framework, the board took very seriously, both concerns and the hopes of those who commented on the proposals.”

The casino race originally began with eight players, but only half remained after eight separate Community Advisory Committees — panels evaluating local support — killed some bids. MGM Yonkers in Westchester also unexpectedly withdrew its application to renovate and expand Empire State Casino, prompting Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano to call on Gov. Kathy Hochul to launch an investigation into the sudden drop out. 
The gambling industry has been vying to break into the New York City market for decades. In 2013, voters approved a constitutional amendment allowing seven casino licenses statewide. The text of the amendment also issued a ten-year moratorium on downstate licenses so upstate casinos could establish themselves before encountering competition from downstate casinos. 
One of the winners in Monday’s decision, Bally’s Corporation, plans to build a 500,000-square-foot casino at Ferry Point in Throggs Neck. The project includes a 500-room hotel, a 2,000-person event center and two parking garages with 4,660 spaces. As part of Bally’s purchase agreement for the site, the Trump Organization — the former operator of Trump Links golf course — is slated to receive $115 million from the deal. 
“Our team has worked closely with community leaders, union partners, and local stakeholders to build a project that delivers real jobs, lasting economic benefits, and a world-class entertainment destination for the Bronx,” said Bally’s spokesperson Lauren Westerfield in a statement. “We are grateful for the board’s confidence and look forward to working with the Gaming Commission as the process moves to its next phase.”  
In Queens, the Metropolitan Park project would transform a 50-acre lot near Citi Field into a resort with 286,208 square-feet of gaming space, an entertainment venue, multiple restaurants, a convention center, hotel and retail. Backed by Mets owner and hedge fund manager Steve Cohen and Hard Rock International, the developers pledged $1.75 billion in community investments including park space and income-restricted housing.
Following the announcement of the recommendations, protests erupted from the crowd by a Flushing group organizing against the Metropolitan Park project.
“After years of community engagement and support, Metropolitan Park is one step closer to becoming a reality,” said Karl Rickett, a spokesperson for Metropolitan Park. “Following a fair, transparent and rigorous process, the Gaming Facility Location Board has validated the positive economic impact this project will have with billions of dollars in tax revenue, 23,000 union jobs, and over $1 billion in community benefits.”
Outside the Graduate Center, members of the coalition against the Metropolitan Park casino protested the Gaming Facility Location Board’s vote for what they perceived as a lack of community involvement in the licensure process. The Community Advisory Committee established local support for the casinos, but Sarah Ahn from the Flushing Workers Center, said that “the process was corrupt.” Ahn also said that community members delivered a list of grievances regarding the project to the committee before they ultimately voted to approve the proposal and felt “disenfranchised” by the process.
“Governor Hochul’s Gaming Commission is giving the green light for Steve Cohen to  squeeze hard earned wages from our immigrant communities at a time when affordability is the key issue in our city. This casino will tear apart families, create gambling addiction, and increase crime and displacement,” the coalition said in a statement. “The tax revenue collected will come at the cost of the most vulnerable people in our community.”
The last license would go to Resorts World, which already operates the city’s lone, current gaming facility. Its 5.6 million-square-foot expansion plan will bring 6,000 slot machines, 800 gaming tables, 2,000 hotel rooms, a 7,000-seat arena, over 7,000 parking spaces, over 30 dining outlets and over a dozen acres of community green space to southeast Queens. The Genting Group, the Malaysian hospitality group that owns it, expects between $3.3 and $4.6 billion in revenue for 2031. 
“Resorts World New York City’s journey to this historic moment represents more than 15 years of work to generate jobs, revenue and opportunities for our neighbors,” said Robert DeSalvio, President of Genting Americas East. “Resorts World New York City’s $7.5 billion proposal is the only bid that can expand operations in just 90 days, generating billions in new revenue for mass transit and public education over the next four years.”
What Happens Next?
While the Gaming Facility Location Board issues the final decisions on the applications, it is up to the State Gaming Commission to issue the casino licenses by the end of the year. The commission will assess whether applicants are financially sound and capable of responsibly operating a casino, including paying the $500 million application fee, securing land, investing $500 million in the local community, and addressing issues such as problem gambling and community impact.
The Gaming Commission will also be responsible for ensuring that the casino winners remain committed to the community investments outlined in their proposal as a part of their licensing agreement. 
Winners must also place a deposit of 5 to 10% of the project’s total investment with the state.
While the lengthy approval process is almost over, it will take another few years until the winners will have their casinos up and running. Bally’s and Metropolitan Park expect to open their doors in 2030, while Resort Worlds will finish the first phase of their expansion by 2026, and the second in 2030. 
Bally’s projects an annual revenue of $1.2 billion in economic output, including $370 million in state and local tax revenue. According to the Metropolitan Park team, their proposal would reap the most annual revenue with $3.9 billion by their third year, and $850 million in taxes. 
The State Gaming Commission is expected to award the final licenses by December 31.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NYC-casino.jpg,,,2025-12-02 11:58:35.915865

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)HAMILTON — With overwhelming support, Ravalli County Commissioners voted unanimously Monday to oppose the placement of the Sheep Creek mining “exploration” project on a federal track designed to improve permitting efficiency.
More than 500 members of the Bitterroot Valley turned up at the Ravalli County Fairgrounds Event Center for the midday meeting, and no member of the public expressed support for the project, to conduct preliminary gallium and heavy “rare earth element” mining to see if a full-scale operation is feasible.

The materials are used in everyday items such as automobiles and cellphones.
The project would take place near the headwaters of the Bitterroot River and in an area with elk, wolverines, Canada lynx, sometimes grizzly bears, and native fish, including westslope cutthroat trout, listed by Fish, Wildlife and Parks as a “fish of special concern.”
Some members of the public asked commissioners to oppose the project altogether.
On behalf of U.S. Critical Materials, Scott Osterman told commissioners and members of the public the work was important to national security and ensuring China didn’t have a stranglehold on material needed for U.S. defense.
Osterman, former head of the Department of Commerce, and another mine representative said the project would use new methods and be environmentally “benign,” although Osterman disputed the area was “pristine.” He apologized for staying mum about the project for so long.
However, members of the public said the headwaters of the Bitterroot River in a closed basin where water is already overallocated is no place for a mine, no place for the substantial truck traffic, and no place for experimenting with new mining technology.
They also raised questions about the corporate structure of U.S. Critical Minerals and its relationship with “shell companies,” as did Commissioner Greg Chilcott, who said shell games make him nervous.
“I don’t want to pick the wrong walnut shell,” Chilcott said.
During public comment, Tom Powers, who described himself as one of the sole surviving members of the original class action suit brought in Libby over asbestos poisoning, said he never worked in the mine there, but he has asbestosis.
Powers said he worked in public buildings, and he worked on the Kootenai River when trucks pulled asbestos across the top of the river, unbeknownst to him.
Powers and many community members were diagnosed with a chronic lung disease, one with symptoms that often don’t appear for years after exposure, and Powers asked commissioners to consider the aftermath of a mine.
“Don’t let this happen here,” Powers said.
Tuesday, commissioners plan to sign a letter to the Congressional delegation and Gov. Greg Gianforte announcing their opposition to the placement of the Sheep Creek project on the federal FAST-41 permitting list.
FAST stands for Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, and Osterman said the acronym incorrectly implies projects are on a “fast track.”
The federal website that describes the FAST-41 permitting council, created under Title 41 of the Act, said it aims to “improve the efficiency of the permitting process for critical infrastructure projects.”
Commission Chairman Dan Huls said he wasn’t sure how the project landed on that list, but the commission learned about it a couple of weeks earlier, he believes from a member of the Congressional delegation.
Commissioner Chilcott said he generally appreciates the idea the federal government could move more quickly, especially when it comes to forest projects in the area, but he does not want a process that cuts out local participation.
After the presentation from U.S. Critical Materials, Commissioner Jeff Burrows grilled the mine representatives, and he said they not only kept the community in the dark, they also didn’t reach out to Ravalli County Commissioners in a timely fashion.
Commissioners are responsible for public safety and health, including roads, he said, but roads already are in disrepair, and Ravalli County does not have a budget to accommodate the significant infrastructure demands of the project.
“If you start talking somewhere between 30 and 5,000 trucks per week coming out of the West Fork, we can’t afford that,” Burrows said. “ … I’m a little disappointed that we haven’t been reached out to earlier, (and) that now, we’re looking at going on the ‘fast track’ program.”

The mine representatives gave varying estimates for truck traffic during the exploratory phase, from “maybe” one to three two-ton trucks a day, “relatively minimal” during the first year, to “potentially more” the second year.
They said the project would ramp up, all under the permitting process, although it was hard to estimate a truck count at full-scale production, should that take place. Osterman said the company would help build roads and bridges if it moved into that phase.
He said even in the early stages, the project would bring 40 to 50 jobs to the Darby area, and average salaries for mining jobs are $85,000 to $135,000 a year, which he described as “significant” economic development.
Members of the public, however, said tourism is the new economy, and the mine posed a risk to tourism, recreation, even property values, and they pointed to different values.
Katelynn Rennaker, who owns the Bitterrooter, a vintage clothing boutique in Stevensville, opted to keep her shop closed on Monday, to lose money, in order to attend the meeting and ask commissioners to withdraw all support for the mine, especially “fast tracking” it.
“This felt way, way more important,” Rennaker said.
Phil Ramsey, general manager with MPG Ranch, and Heather Barber, director of the Bitterroot Water Partnership, gave rebuttal testimony to the mine company’s presentation, and Barber said she had never seen as many people in attendance at the fairgrounds before.
Ramsey said the companies interested in mining in the Bitterroot had been prospecting the headwaters since 2022, but they had opened no local office, offered no regular briefing, and made no full data releases.
“Trust is earned through documents and relationships, not slogans,” Ramsey said.
He said if the company was serious about earning the community’s trust, it would remove itself from the FAST-41 list, although Osterman declined to do so when a commissioner asked. Ramsey also said the company representatives told one story to the public about the scope of the mine, but another to potential investors, with “major discrepancies.”
Barber too said she had seen no meaningful engagement from the mine representatives, despite an executive recently stating permits were expected in time for production in 2026. She said the valley already faces mounting pressures from more water users and hotter summers, and the mine proposal puts the river and local economy at risk.
Tourists spent $7.5 million on guiding services alone in the Bitterroot Valley in 2023, the fishery and tourism economy bring $67 million a year to the valley, and the tourism economy is growing, Barber said.
“It’s a significantly larger portion of the economy than 40 to 50 jobs may create,” Barber said.
She said the mine representatives see a geographic anomaly in the Bitterroot that could be lucrative, but the Bitterroot is a home, and one not worth risking to people who value public lands, healthy rivers, hunting, fishing, floating, bird watching, farming, ranching, and local businesses and families.
“We’re lucky to live, work and play here, and people from around the world visit to see something that is increasingly rare, a vibrant valley sustained by a healthy river running through its heart,” Barber said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Line-for-rcc-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-02 11:58:35.915865

Monday the flag was raised over the Mississippi Governor’s Mansion by three members of the U.S. Air Force after remarks from Gov. Tate Reeves and First Lady Elee Reeves. 
“The United States flag reminds us that our history, though marked by struggle, sacrifice and great challenges, has always been defined by perseverance,” said Reeves before the flag was raised on the overcast, brisk day in downtown Jackson.
Elee Reeves, who is also a co-chair of the America250 Mississippi Commission, said “The American flag serves as a beacon of hope for those chasing the American dream, a blessing to the families welcoming their loved ones home from service and a reminder of the values we teach our children.”
The America250 Mississippi Commission will hold various events next year as part of the country’s 250th anniversary celebration.

(Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Homeland Security)The Hoosier congressional delegation — in a push led by U.S. Senator Todd Young — is urging the Federal Aviation Administration to name Indiana as one of two new national drone test sites.
In a Monday letter to the federal agency, all nine of Indiana’s representatives and both senators expressed support for a bid from the Indiana Economic Development Corporation and the Applied Research Institute as the FAA expands its Unmanned Aircraft System Test Site program.
If selected, Indiana supporters say the designation would open opportunities for universities and manufacturers in the state to develop cutting-edge drone technologies.
“Indiana is uniquely situated to best assist the FAA in integrating UAS into the national airspace system as well as advance the United States’ capacities for manufacturing and deploying drone technologies,” the delegation told FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford, who previously served as the chief executive of Indianapolis-based Republic Airways Holdings until he was tapped by President Donald Trump earlier this year to serve as FAA administrator.
Story continues below.
Indiana Delegation Letter in Support of FAA UAS Test Site
 
Lawmakers added that, “between the geographical location in the heart of the Midwest, the already numerous testing assets for a variety of missions, and state and federal representatives who are committed to supporting advancement of these critical technologies, our state is poised to provide the best outcomes for American leadership in drone manufacturing and deployment.”
The FAA is adding two sites to its national network, which supports research, safety evaluation and integration of unmanned aircraft, according to the federal agency.
Young’s office said Indiana stakeholders submitted their application to the agency Monday, and the delegation letter was sent the same day.
Indiana’s manufacturing strength is a central part of the pitch. 
Lawmakers wrote that while developing advanced drone technologies is vital, “it will be even more critical that we can take these newly developed technologies and scale them at a level in which we can deploy them to industries across the country.” 
“From applications in defense, agriculture, public safety, and beyond, there is a demand and need for U.S.-developed and produced technologies that address the national security and privacy concerns posed by their foreign-made counterparts,” they said. “Indiana is also well-positioned to meet the influx of workforce needs that will accompany this growing ecosystem.”
Universities and military assets were also highlighted.
New Indiana task force aims to boost state’s role in U.S. drone development

The letter pointed to Purdue University, which lawmakers noted has “the first university-owned airport in the country, the largest indoor motion capture facility in the world, and a faculty dedicated to addressing the challenges of safely integrating UAS into the national airspace.”
Highlighted, too, was Indiana’s Technology Readiness and Experimentation initiative at Camp Atterbury, which in August “demonstrated the ability to neutralize a 49-drone swarm with a single electromagnetic pulse,” as well as testing space at the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center and counter-UAS work at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane.
The delegation also underscored ARI’s role as a coordinator of state and federal research efforts, saying its experience “managing the Silicon Crossroads Hub, Heartland Bioworks tech hub, and the Defense Innovation Unit OnRamp Program” positions the institute well to support the test-site designation.
State-level coordination is additionally part of the argument. 
The letter referenced Gov. Mike Braun’s Oct. 29 executive order establishing a statewide drone task force. 
The new “Indiana Initiative for Drone Dominance Task Force” will coordinate work across government, universities and private industry to support federal efforts to strengthen U.S. leadership in drone technology and airspace security.
The task force must deliver its strategic plan and recommendations to the governor by July 31, 2026.
Young, who serves on the Senate Commerce Committee and has worked on drone policy at the federal level, helped Braun craft the executive order.
The FAA has not announced a timeline for selecting the new testing sites.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Republican Party is moving quickly after Republicans in the Alaska Senate confirmed Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s picks for two vacancies in the Senate on Saturday.
Sens. George Rauscher, R-Sutton, and Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, encountered no significant opposition from Republican lawmakers and were sworn in after a secret ballot vote on Saturday morning in Anchorage. They replace former Sens. Mike Shower and Shelley Hughes who are running for lieutenant governor and governor, respectively, in 2026.
Rauscher and Tilton resigned from their House seats immediately after the vote and were promptly sworn in as senators.
Their resignations open two vacancies in the Alaska House, and the Alaska Republican Party has set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Dec. 4  to receive applications from local Republicans interested in representing the approximately 36,000 Alaskans in House District 26 and House District 29 in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. 
Party officials are slated to meet Saturday at the Best Western Lake Lucille Inn in Wasilla to pick three applicants for each seat to send to Dunleavy for consideration. 
Those meetings are not open to the public, according to the party’s request for nominations.
Dunleavy has until Dec. 29 to make a final selection and is not required to pick from among the party-nominated candidates. 
Legislators expect him to act sooner than the deadline in order to allow House Republicans time to take a confirmation vote and for the new lawmakers to settle in before the regular legislative session begins Jan. 20. 
Rauscher and Tilton each said they don’t have a preferred nominee at this point.
“Every day, somebody else calls me to ask whether they should put their name in,” Rauscher said, adding that the short deadline means interested people should hurry. 
Tilton said she’s aware of “five really great individuals” in her former House district. “At this point in time, I don’t have one I would say I would endorse … they are all excellent,” she said.
Both Rauscher and Tilton said they are keeping their House staff members as they transfer to the Senate; Rauscher said he’s been busy handling the administrative duties that involve shifting from the House to the Senate, including shifting offices and handling paperwork.
“We’re hitting the ground running,” he said.
In a short-lived moment of comedy, Rauscher’s listing on the official legislative website displayed the picture of former Rep. Sara Rasmussen, R-Anchorage, instead of Rauscher’s proper headshot.
Before the legislative session begins, Rauscher and Tilton will join four other Republicans in choosing a new Senate Minority Leader, to replace Shower, to become the face of the Senate’s six-person minority caucus. No date has been set for that decision.
The Senate is led by a bipartisan 14-person caucus that includes five Republicans and nine Democrats. 
In the House, Republicans didn’t wait for their vacancies to be filled before selecting a minority leader to replace Rep. Mia Costello, R-Anchorage, who stepped down from the role last month.
On Saturday, the House’s minority Republicans picked Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, as Minority Leader and Rep. Justin Ruffridge, R-Soldotna, as Minority Whip. 
The House is divided between a 21-person multipartisan majority and a 19-person Republican minority. Of those 19 Republican seats, only 17 are filled, and several members were absent from Saturday’s vote due to prior commitments. 
On social media, Reps. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, and Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, denounced the choices, saying in part that they were untimely.
In a news release announcing the vote, Johnson said, “I don’t want to see the House Republicans go too long without leadership in place. If we had at least one of the leadership positions filled, we could have carried on but without either position we were lacking in key tools to move forward and be effective as a caucus.”

Tim Walz was on “Meet the Press” this week and made a few flummoxing assertions just inside a single question and answer. 
Let’s roll the tape: 
Asked Sunday by the host Kristen Welker if he takes responsibility for widespread fraud discovered in some Minnesota social services programs, Walz answered: 
“I take responsibility for putting people in jail. Governors don’t get to just talk theoretically, we have to solve problems. And I will note, it’s not just Somalis. Minnesota is a generous state, Minnesota is a prosperous state, a well-run state. We’re AAA bond rated. But that attracts criminals. Those people are going to jail. We’re doing everything we can. But to demonize an entire community on the actions of a few? It’s lazy.”
Start from the bottom: Do fraudsters seek out states with AAA bond ratings? 
I have trouble picturing a couple scammers poring over the S & P’s bond ratings, looking at each other and saying, “We must go north!” 
Especially since our fraud problem is homegrown. 
Also, it’s a real shame that being a “well-run state” attracts fraud, per Walz. Sorta puts us in a difficult bind: Do we want a “well-run state”? If we do, I guess we’re inviting fraud. Bummer. 
At the start of his answer, Walz takes responsibility for “putting people in jail.” 
This is an interesting assertion, in the Minnesota sense. The federal government of both Democratic and Republican administrations have charged more than 80 people with stealing from food aid and Medicaid programs. 
What would Walz’s role be in sending people to federal prison after federal prosecutions?
His spokeswoman sent me this statement: “Prosecutions don’t materialize out of thin air. Department of Human Services does extensive investigative work in collaboration with federal prosecutors, and the governor has created a specialized law enforcement fraud unit at the (Bureau of Criminal Apprehension). The executive’s job is to assist law enforcement and prosecutors in every way possible, not to undermine their work by pardoning fraudsters.” 
The last bit is a swipe at President Donald Trump, who has declared amnesty for just about every white-collar criminal in America. (And never forget the 1,600 insurrectionists.)
OK, fair enough. 
I have no doubt that Walz and his team are intensely focused on this issue these days, now that it’s blown up in their faces, and that the Department of Human Services and BCA are helping the feds develop cases that are leading to convictions. Bravo. 
But to call the recent efforts tardy is vastly understating it. 
When the Reformer reported in 2024 that the FBI was investigating autism centers on the suspicion of phony billing, a DHS assistant commissioner waved us off when we asked about explosive growth of the program, which seemingly should have raised red flags: 
“I don’t think we are surprised or particularly disturbed by the rate of growth,” she said.  
She also told us the the growth was “pretty consistent” with other DHS programs, such as “housing stabilization services,” which is pretty funny in retrospect because that program was so riddled with fraud that Walz moved to shut it down this summer.
In the spring of 2025, even as a February Star Tribune report raised questions about the potential for fraud in the housing stability program, Walz’s budget request included funding for additional DHS positions to keep up with the explosive growth of the program, the Strib reported. “Where it could, DHS moved to speed up processing times and let more individuals into the program.”
A defense lawyer for some of the defendants in the various fraud cases recently told The New York Times that it was all so easy they figured it must be OK to steal: 
“No one was doing anything about the red flags. It was like someone was stealing money from the cookie jar and they kept refilling it,” he said.  
That doesn’t sound like “extensive investigation” to me. 
As a result of this mess, Minnesota’s reputation for clean government and business has been badly damaged. 
As worrisome: tens of thousands of Somali-Americans — who happen to have the same ancestral background as most of the Minnesota scammers, but nothing else in common — have been slandered by Trump and his cronies. And now the community will face the terror of ICE.
But it all started with the Walz administration’s feckless failures.  
Unfortunately, Trump and the internet have ushered in the political era of brazening it out. Never apologize. Never take responsibility. Spew whatever argle-bargle comes in your mind. Attack. Repeat.  
This behavior should be familiar to Walz, a former high school geography teacher and football coach. It’s the behavior of adolescents, and it’s consumed our entire politico-media system. 
To his credit, Walz’s love of Minnesotans and Minnesota is that of the convert: ardent and true. So he should consider respecting our intelligence, and coming clean about how he and key people in his administration failed us. It would be a start. 
If he’s unwilling to do so, maybe it’s time for a courageous Democrat to consider a primary challenge.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250609_0528-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 13:57:25.354131

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Licensed gun dealers are a major source of firearms that end up illegally trafficked, according to a new analysis using federal data by the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun laws.
Gun trafficking involves diverting guns from legal commerce into the illegal market, often through straw purchases, unlicensed dealing or other methods that bypass background checks and federal recordkeeping requirements.
A straw purchase is when someone who can legally buy a gun does so on behalf of another person who cannot or does not want their name associated with the purchase.
Using trace data from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Everytown for Gun Safety found that 96% of guns recovered at crime scenes and traced between 2017 and 2023 were originally purchased from a licensed dealer. Everytown estimates more than 1.27 million guns will have been trafficked nationwide by 2026.
Licensed gun dealers earned an estimated $695 million from firearms that were later identified as trafficked, according to the report.
The report also points to gaps in federal oversight of gun shops, noting that the number of gun shop inspections has fallen sharply during the Trump administration. But the issue long predates the current administration.
In Oregon, for example, federal regulators inspected fewer than 2% of the state’s roughly 2,000 gun dealers in 2022 and 2023, according to records obtained by Oregon Public Broadcasting, a nonprofit media organization.
Stand-your-ground laws linked to higher homicide rates, new report finds

A federal budget document released in June shows that the U.S. Department of Justice plans to eliminate two-thirds of the investigators responsible for monitoring federally licensed gun dealers — reducing the number of inspectors from about 850 to roughly 300.
In May, the ATF announced a new policy loosening the rules that dictate when gun dealer licenses should be revoked. And since Trump took office in January, roughly 80% of the ATF’s 2,500 special agents have been directed to take on at least some immigration enforcement duties.
Everytown argues in its report that these oversight lapses allow suspicious sales to go undetected.
ATF data also shows that trafficked guns are involved in twice as many shootings as non-trafficked firearms. Nearly 88% of people who received these guns were legally prohibited from buying firearms, according to the report. Trafficked guns were frequently linked to drug offenses, aggravated assaults, homicides and attempted homicides.
The Everytown report urges states to increase regulatory inspections of gun dealers, adopt gun laws to deter trafficking and use data to identify and disrupt illegal supply chains.
“My years at ATF taught me that states don’t have to wait for Washington to act,” Marianna Mitchem, a senior firearms industry advisor at Everytown, wrote in an email. Mitchem is a former associate assistant director of field operations at the ATF.
At least 16 states and Washington, D.C., license and regulate firearms dealers, according to Everytown’s research.
Colorado and Illinois, for example, require gun dealers to obtain a state license and comply with security, recordkeeping, and storage standards, with state officials conducting regular inspections.

(Photo by David Berding/Getty Images for People's Action Institute)The University of Minnesota Medical School opened its doors in 2024 to UnitedHealth Group to launch a pilot course entitled “Leadership and Value.” 
UHG is a private, for-profit corporation headquartered in Eden Prairie, a 20-minute drive from the University of Minnesota campus. It is the world’s largest health care corporation by revenue, containing two main divisions: United Healthcare (health insurance) and Optum (health care services, data and pharmacy benefit managers). 
The medical school elective was developed for fourth-year students interested in health systems leadership. 
As a former student of this course, I fear the UHG-University of Minnesota partnership is the beginning of an unholy union. 
To contextualize my concern, consider UHG’s philosophy. The insurance company’s “value-based care” model claims to promote efficiency by funding only “high-yield” medical care. In practice, this approach biases health care delivery toward withholding care rather than providing it. When large insurers like UHG decide what care has “value,” they decide what is worth paying for. Health care decision-making shifts from the physician to UHG, a practice that conveniently saves the company money. Unsurprisingly, UHG now leads the nation in claims denials. 
The partnership’s origin story is the first warning sign of UHG’s intentions. According to the course director — whose comments I transcribed — UHG approached Dean Jakub Tolar with a proposal to embed itself within the medical school, pitching the course to train students to become “high-value providers.” Tolar ultimately negotiated a “balanced” curriculum wherein each entity would direct half the course: UHG would preach the benefits of value-based care, while the U offered weekly debriefs, health systems lessons and leadership workshops. 
We met with a dozen or so UHG employees throughout the four weeks. The pattern of these sessions quickly became clear: First, UHG employees would present a slideshow with graphics and slogans that ranged from vague corporate jargon to optimistic messaging about the future of health care. Then, they opened time for questions. Students would – either curiously or skeptically – challenge the corporate newspeak. 
In one lecture, a UHG employee from the diversity, equity and inclusion office showcased the company’s health equity projects. During the Q&A, students asked if the company ever sacrificed their bottom line for the sake of improving health disparities. They answered clearly: Their efforts only focus on communities with high membership enrollment. In an audio recording of the session, this speaker states: “The disparity does have to align with a return on investment.” 
Further questioning revealed that UHG does not share its population health data with local communities or universities, nor does it provide long-term funding for these health equity projects. 
They ended bluntly: “None of it is charity work, it’s all intentionally designed to improve outcomes in communities where we have members [patients] so that we get return on investment.”
This pattern — wherein students dragged the facts out of UHG employees during the Q&As — raises several questions about the course. Could the course have met its learning objectives without students actively participating? Does the “balanced” curriculum negotiated by the U depend on students’ own skepticism? Importantly, where were the expert voices offering opposing views to UHG’s model? 
A truly balanced perspective is requisite in any university class, especially housed in a state flagship institution. 
Were it not for consistent student pushback, the UHG sessions would have amounted to corporate propaganda. 
Many topics in a medical curriculum don’t require debate, but health care financing does, especially when UHG is involved. UHG is a controversial entity in the American health care landscape, with at least 16 lawsuits in the past seven years over denial of care, upcoding and overbilling, patient privacy violations, and anticompetitive steering of patients and providers. The Department of Justice is investigating the company, according to reporting in Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal. None of this appeared in the four-week curriculum. 
While the course may encourage critical thinking about the health care system, it also welcomes an onslaught of UHG propaganda without counterpoints or fact-checks of their claims. Balancing UHG’s perspective with a neutral academic one — while better than nothing — is not a “balance” at all. 
This course represents the worrisome start of a deepening relationship between UHG and the U. During one visit, we were unexpectedly joined by then-CEO Sir Andrew Witty. 
We asked what he envisions for the partnership’s future. 
In recorded audio from the course, he replied: “It just doesn’t make sense for us not to be working together more… because we feel like [this course] is going well, it will be an encouragement to then move to the next.” 
Pressed on what “the next” may entail, he replied, “It could be anything! It could be more in the education space, research collaboration…working with the medical school more directly in terms of collaboration on new ideas.”
In short, UHG has its sights set on U, and it is eager to ratify this marriage. 
The U should at least get a decent prenup.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2162260765.jpg,,,2025-12-02 09:59:30.547631

Laura Kelly says weak state corporate income tax revenue and sales tax receipts should convince the 2026 Kansas Legislature to be cautious in developing a new state government budget. In this Nov. 25, 2025, photo, she appears at an event at Cedar Crest in Topeka. (Photo by Grace Hills for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A month of softness in state revenue from corporate income tax and retail sales tax led Gov. Laura Kelly to urge the 2026 Kansas Legislature to take a cautionary approach to managing the state’s finances.
Kelly, a Democrat approaching the final year of her second term as governor, responded to the November revenue report Monday by asking the Republican-controlled Legislature to be judicious as it worked to craft the new state government budget.
“November’s tax collections were nearly on target overall,” Kelly said. “While individual income tax collections were up, corporate income tax collections were again below estimates and significantly below November 2024 levels.”
The Kansas Department of Revenue’s report offered a snapshot of where Kansas stood five months into the current fiscal year compared to the initial five months of last fiscal year.
She said the state collected this fiscal year $74 million less in corporate income tax than last fiscal year. In addition, retail sales tax revenue slipped by $53 million in a year-to-year comparison.
The state’s bottom line, however, stayed in positive territory for the fiscal year because individual income tax collections surged by $173 million, or 9.9%, above last year’s performance at this juncture. Overall, considering all sources of state tax revenue, Kansas sits $58 million above the five-month total reported through November 2024.
“As I develop my next budget proposal I am not considering just fiscal year 2027. I am also looking on to the out-years to keep our state on solid financial footing,” Kelly said.
She said Kansas was on pace to erode a $3 billion cash reserve by spending $300 million to $700 million more annually than collected in taxes.
In the past, Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, said the governor was fond of “grandstanding” when speaking about state budget issues. He said Republican lawmakers were committed to showing Kansans “results that can be achieved with level-headed and carefully crafted policy.”
Kansas governors submit to the Legislature in January of each year a constitutionally balanced budget for consideration by the House and Senate.
The Republican-controlled Legislature — as it did in 2024 — has been working on an alternative budget bill. The House-Senate budget committee scheduled two days of meetings next week to hammer out details of its outline for the fiscal year starting July 1, 2026.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Kelly-24-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-02 09:59:30.547631

In 2024, Washoe County saw a nearly 38% increase in reported Lyme disease cases from the previous year, from eight cases to 11. Reported cases of the illness have increased in Northern Nevada year-over-year since 2020, according to tracking by the Northern Nevada Public Health office. 
Public health officials say the true number of cases may be higher due to underreporting. The disease can be difficult to track because symptoms mimic those of other diseases, and only patients with the worst outcomes are usually tested.
Lyme disease is transmitted through the bite of an infected black-legged tick, also known as a deer tick, which must be attached for 24 to 48 hours to spread the illness. During the nymph stage, when they are most active, black-legged ticks are about the size of a poppy seed and are easy to miss.
In about 80% of Lyme disease cases, a “bulls-eye” rash spreads around the site of the tick bite, but without one Lyme disease can be easy to misdiagnose. 
Early signs include common influenza-like symptoms including fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and swollen lymph nodes. As the disease develops without treatment, more serious symptoms may emerge. In more severe cases the disease can impact joints, the nervous system and the heart for weeks to months after the initial tick bite. Delays in treatment may also increase the risk for chronic illness.
“Unfortunately, if it is Lyme disease and it goes untreated it can progress to more serious signs and symptoms which can appear months after a tick bite,” said Northern Nevada Public Health epidemiologist Liliana Wilbert.
This year, people in the U.S. are seeking emergency care for tick bites at the highest level since 2017, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Lyme disease through the years has been found mainly in the eastern and upper mid-western states of the U.S. But the range of Lyme disease cases has expanded significantly since 1995, according to the CDC — including to places where people are less familiar with the risks and how to prevent the disease.
Milder winters and longer warm seasons have allowed ticks to expand their range, bringing Lyme disease to more areas. Lyme disease-carrying black-legged ticks are mostly active when temperatures are above 45 degrees, and thrive in areas with at least 85% humidity, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.
“It’s more favorable for the ticks in the northeastern regions and coastal California. It wouldn’t be as favorable here in Nevada. That’s not to say we don’t have ticks that do live here,” Wilbert said.
In July, Carson City Health and Human Services confirmed a case of Lyme disease for a person who had not traveled outside Northern Nevada in the four weeks prior to symptom onset. The CDC also reports that more cases of Lyme disease have appeared along the west coast and in Nevada in recent years.
Still, most cases of Lyme disease reported in Northern Nevada in 2024 were among people who had recently traveled out of the state. Eight of the eleven cases in 2024 had a documented history of travel or recent relocation, some with diagnoses originating from outside the state, suggesting potential exposure in other jurisdictions. The remaining three cases had no identifiable source of exposure, indicating an unknown origin of infection.
In some of those cases people traveled to nearby Northern California, an area a recent study by the Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Research Center identified as an underreported area not fully captured by traditional CDC surveillance methods. 
Wilbert said gaps in data can also make it difficult to track Lyme disease across state borders. For example, case counts are attributed to the individual’s place of residence, rather than the location where the exposure or infection occurred.
That can result in skewed data without clear answers. In Nevada, most reported cases in Nevada were among women at 73%.
“When the cases come to us, they’re typically reported on a lab report,” said Wilbert. “We don’t know why most of them have been women, that is definitely something that it’s interesting.”
To reduce the risk of Lyme disease, the Northern Nevada Public Health Department says it’s crucial to minimize contact with ticks and their habitats, particularly in areas with dense vegetation. 
“We highly recommend that people be careful when they go out into wooded areas and go camping or hiking because they’re so easy to overlook and prevention is the key,” Wilbert said.
Recommended precautions include wearing long-sleeved shirts and closed-toe shoes, wearing permethrin-treated clothing, applying EPA-registered insect repellent to exposed skin, and performing daily tick checks. Showering within two hours of outdoor activity can help remove ticks before they attach.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2199151003-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 09:59:30.547631

Murry, a Kansas City resident, said he’s always loved watching sports. When he learned about sports betting via social media, he started placing bets on the Chiefs.
“I’ll go on Sunday mornings, so probably once a week, maybe twice if there’s something fun,” Murry said. “Or if I’m over there — running errands in Overland Park or visiting family in Prairie Village — I’ll put it in.”
Most of the time, Murry has kept it simple and found a parking lot to place his bets — and he wasn’t alone. Murry said he’s often seen other people parked and on their phones on the Kansas side of the border.
“On Sunday mornings, there’s usually a few cars that you can tell (are placing bets),” he said. “Or if you’re just driving, you’ll see cars parked on the side of the road that are probably doing that.”
But when he gets a group of friends together, they’ve gone to a bar on the Kansas side of State Line Road to bet as they watch the game.
Murry and his friends are among thousands of Missourians who cross the border into Kansas, Illinois and other states to bet on sports. Of the eight states that border Missouri, only one — Oklahoma — has not legalized sports betting in some form.

Between Sept. 5 and Oct. 21, 2024, GeoComply — a software company that checks sportsbook users’ locations to determine whether they can place a bet — identified more than 216,000 mobile sports betting accounts in Missouri.
During that time, more than 3,700 Missourians traveled to Kansas and more than 2,800 traveled to Illinois to bet on sports, according to data from GeoComply.
The phenomenon is similar to cross-border shopping, according to Adam Hoffer, the director of excise tax policy at the center-right Tax Foundation.
“In Missouri’s case, just based on where the state population is, you’re definitely going to see an impact on neighboring states,” Hoffer said.
In November 2024, Missourians legalized sports betting, and on Dec. 1, 2025, sportsbooks went live within Missouri’s borders for the first time. Murry, who spoke with The Beacon a few days before sportsbooks launched, said he’s excited about the change.
“It was time for it to happen,” he said. “I think, no matter what your opinion is on it, people are going to other states — people are going to do it regardless.”
Between Sept. 5 and Oct. 21, 2024, thousands of Missourians traveled across state lines to place bets on sports.

He said he appreciated the greater accessibility of not having to travel to place bets. While he thinks he’ll bet “more or less” the same amount, he is looking forward to live betting, which he said wasn’t as much of an option before.
As Missouri bettors stay in their homes and neighborhoods to place bets, other states will feel the impact of lost revenue, Hoffer said.
Missouri expects to collect about $28 million in tax revenue from sports betting annually. Although the state stands to collect revenue that would otherwise go to neighboring states, Missouri is late to legalizing sports betting, which means it won’t attract as much cross-border betting from its neighbors.
However, as the Midwest embraces sports betting, some states’ sports betting tax policies could drive bettors into neighboring states, Hoffer said.
“I don’t think Missouri is going to be a huge winner (in terms of) an influx of cross-border bettors. Where they might see it most is actually from Illinois, because Illinois just placed a per-wager tax,” he said. “What we expect to see as a result in Illinois are fewer, smaller bets.”
Illinois “bettors can, if they’re near a border with Missouri … dodge that tax by betting across the border. So I do think (Missouri) will see some net influx from people living in neighboring states,” he added. “I don’t think it’s going to be enormous, but I do think there will certainly be some bettors looking to avoid the higher taxes in neighboring states.”
An advantage of being a later adopter is that Missouri could evaluate other states’ sports betting tax policies to see what works best, Hoffer said.
“I think that’s quite helpful in this case,” he said. “If I were to design a (sports betting) tax structure from scratch, I’d pick the way Missouri designed it. Their rate of 10% is going to put them close to the median rate.”
Sports betting taxes aren’t competitive in the same way as taxes on cigarettes or gasoline, “where prices — and, in part, taxes — are advertised on billboards on the side of the highway so consumers know where to shop for the best rates,” Hoffer said.
Still, higher taxes could mean sportsbooks have to worsen the odds for their customers in order to ensure they make a profit. As a result, worse odds could push bettors to nearby states with lower taxes and better odds, he said.
“Sports bettors, like a lot of other cross-border shoppers we see across the country, will know where they can get the best odds for their wagers and will bet accordingly,” Hoffer said.

Let’s jump into some California housing news:

Housing projects on state land: Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office last week unveiled six affordable housing projects that are planned to be built on state property, including on former DMV sites in Fontana and Stockton. The projects include at least 840 affordable housing units in total and stem from a 2019 executive order directing state agencies to review state-owned property that could be used for housing. All six sites entered into lease option agreements by Nov. 13, according to a spokesperson for the state’s Department of General Services.


‘Milestone’ for LA-area wildfire recovery?: In November Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass touted the first single-family home in Pacific Palisades to receive the city’s approval for occupancy, after the Palisades Fire destroyed thousands of buildings and claimed 12 lives in January. In a statement Bass said the “major milestone” marked “an important moment of hope,” but a homebuilding company, not a family, owns the house, reports Politico. The company, Thomas James Homes, bought the property located on 915 N Kagawa Street in November 2024 and began the permitting process before the wildfire. Bass received backlash from critics who argued the praise was misleading.


Low-cost housing study: A new study by the nonprofit Enterprise analyzed 39 single-room occupancy properties in California owned by nonprofit operators. Viewed by housing advocates as a critical component of housing for low-income tenants, the study looked at more than 3,000 SRO units and found that most are “inherently quite old,” with an average build year of 1928 — a year before the Great Depression. Ninety-five percent of the projects also operated on a deficit, compelling housing providers to contribute more than $24 million of their money to keep the properties open. These housing units also had an average 20% vacancy rate.

At least 10 candidates are running in 2026 to succeed Newsom as the next California governor and the race remains wide open: In a poll released by UC Berkeley last month, 44% of surveyed voters did not have a preference for governor, and no candidate polled above 15%. 
To keep track of the revolving door of candidates, CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang has a guide with details of each of the top candidates, which include:

Xavier Becerra: The former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary was associated with a scandal recently after the FBI revealed that Newsom’s former chief of staff and other political consultants conspired to steal money from a dormant campaign account held by Becerra.


Katie Porter: Last month the former Orange County congressmember received some bad press after she was caught on camera trying to walk out of a TV interview, and another video showed Porter berating a staff member during a Zoom call.


Chad Bianco: The pro-Trump Riverside County Sheriff wants to loosen regulations on businesses and overturn California’s sanctuary laws. Though he is neck-and-neck with Porter in the polls, no GOP candidate has won a statewide seat in nearly 20 years.

The change caused the porn industry’s largest website, Pornhub, to block access  in Missouri, issuing a statement calling the new rule ineffective and a potential risk to user privacy.
Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway, who took over the policy after it was initiated by her predecessor, celebrated the news, calling Pornhub’s decision proof that the rule is needed.
“If a billion-dollar corporation would rather leave Missouri than verify that children are not accessing graphic sexual content,” she said, “that tells you everything you need to know about its priorities.”
It’s already illegal to show children pornography under federal law, however it’s rarely enforced. Various measures exist to verify a person’s age online, such as uploading a government ID or consent to facial recognition software.
The new Missouri rule requires any commercial website or platform to implement some form of age-verification measure if at least a third of the content it offers is pornographic. Platforms that refuse to comply are subject to penalties, injunctive relief, and enforcement actions for engaging in unfair and deceptive practices.
“If you want to operate in Missouri, you must prove your users are adults,” Hanaway said. “If that is too much to ask, then you will not operate here,” 
In September, a trade association representing the adult entertainment industry told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that it was considering a legal challenge to the rule, since they were created outside the legislative process. 
The legislature has tried to pass age-verification laws, with little success. 
A bill nearly identical to the new rule received initial approval from the Missouri House in February but was never brought up for a final vote in the chamber. 
The bill faced criticism that it would ultimately do more harm than good by driving traffic to lesser-known sites that don’t comply with the law and have fewer safety protocols. Critics also raised concerns about privacy, arguing it is impossible to ensure websites aren’t retaining user data. The regulations could also lead to censorship, critics warned, specifically regarding information about sexuality. 
“While safety and compliance are at the forefront of our mission, giving your ID card every time you want to visit an adult platform is not the most effective solution for protecting users,” Pornhub said in its statement, “and in fact, it will put children and your privacy at risk.”
Hanaway said Pornhub is “welcome to leave Missouri.”
“What is not welcome,” she said, “is any company that puts profit above the safety of our children,”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2302-e1755617763363.jpg,,,2025-12-02 08:56:15.922488

Here’s a look at the current field of candidates,Jeanne Kuang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/12/governors-race-current-field/,"A few moments of controversy have touched an otherwise sleepy, wide open race to be California’s next governor.","In summary
A few moments of controversy have touched an otherwise sleepy, wide open race to be California’s next governor. 


The game of musical chairs in the race to be California’s next governor lost another player last week. 
After Democratic businessman Stephen Cloobeck — who was polling at below half a percent — dropped out of the race and endorsed Rep. Eric Swalwell on Monday, at least 10 candidates remain. 
Voters are hardly to blame if the names don’t ring a bell. Though it’s wound on for more than a year now, the 2026 governor’s race remains unexpectedly wide open. In one poll released last month, 44% of surveyed voters did not have a preference for governor and no candidate polled above 15%.
The primary election is next June. Here’s a look at the field right now: 
XAVIER BECERRA
If former Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra was looking for attention for his campaign, he found it in the form of negative headlines. 
Last month, federal prosecutors indicted a Sacramento powerbroker in an alleged corruption scandal that rocked the state’s Democratic establishment. At its center? A dormant campaign account held by Becerra, from which prosecutors allege Gov. Gavin Newsom’s former chief of staff Dana Williamson conspired with other political consultants to steal $225,000. Williamson is charged with helping to divert the funds to the wife of Becerra’s longtime aide, Sean McCluskie, who has pleaded guilty in the alleged scheme. 
Becerra was California’s first Latino attorney general before serving as a cabinet secretary for former President Joe Biden. He is running primarily on a platform of lowering health care costs. 
He has not been accused of wrongdoing in the case and has said he was unaware of what was happening. But it’s still possible the association — and the implication he wasn’t paying attention — will taint his campaign, already polling at just 8%. 
The controversy is one of a few moments of intrigue in an otherwise quiet race. 
KATIE PORTER
In October, former Orange County Rep. Katie Porter, a Democrat, was caught on camera trying to walk out of a TV interview with a reporter who pressed her on whether she needed Republican support in the race. A second video followed, showing Porter berating a staff member during a Zoom call. At the time considered the front-runner, she rode out the news cycle and later said she “could have done better” about the behavior in the videos, but they appeared to have dropped her approval ratings. She is essentially tied with the top Republican candidate. 
Porter made a name for herself as one of a “blue wave” of female, Democratic lawmakers elected to Congress during the first Trump administration in 2018. A law professor at UC Irvine who ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate last year, she gained attention for her tough questioning of corporate executives using her signature whiteboard. 
TOM STEYER
Joining a wide field of other Democrats, billionaire investor and climate activist Tom Steyer announced last month he is jumping into the race.

Steyer, who made his fortune by founding a San Francisco hedge fund, has used his wealth to back liberal causes, including the environment. He’s never held public office before, but ran a short-lived campaign for president in 2020. 
CHAD BIANCO
Pro-Trump Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco is neck-and-neck with Porter in the polls, though he is unlikely to last near the top of the pack in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly two-to-one and a GOP candidate hasn’t won a statewide seat in nearly 20 years.
The cowboy-hat-toting Bianco has heavily criticized Democratic governance. He argues for loosening regulations on businesses and says he wants to overturn California’s sanctuary law that restricts local police from cooperating with federal deportation officers. 
ERIC SWALWELL 
Other Democrats have focused on their biographies and experiences in government to try to distinguish themselves in a race where name recognition is low across the board. All have said they want to make California more affordable and push back on the Trump administration’s impact on the state.

Swalwell, a former prosecutor and Bay Area congressman, will likely lean heavily on his anti-Trump bonafides. He was one of several members of Congress appointed by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to help lead the second Trump impeachment after the attempted Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection and is now the latest Democrat under attack by the Trump administration over his mortgage.
ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA
Former Los Angeles mayor and former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa is among the more moderate of the Democratic field. He boasts of his time running the state’s largest city, during which he boosted the police force. He ran for governor unsuccessfully in 2018. 
BETTY YEE
Former state Controller Betty Yee emphasizes her experience with the state budget and the tax system, having been a top finance office in ex-Gov. Gray Davis’ administration and having sat on the state Board of Equalization. 
TONY THURMOND
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, a Democrat, is the only candidate currently in a statewide seat. He emphasizes his background as a social worker who grew up on public assistance programs in a low-income family. He has stated an ambitious goal of building two million housing units on surplus state land. 
IAN CALDERON
Ian Calderon, a former Democratic Assembly majority leader, is emphasizing his relative youth. He was the first millennial member of the state Assembly, and is part of a Los Angeles County political dynasty. He has some ties to the cryptocurrency industry and has name-dropped it in ads and debates. 
STEVE HILTON
Republican Steve Hilton, a Fox News contributor, was an adviser for British conservative Prime Minister David Cameron before pivoting to American politics. Before launching his campaign he released a book this year calling California “America’s worst-run state.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112525-Candidate-Forum-CS-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-02 08:56:15.922488
,California,2025-12-02 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,After ICE arrests come health scares for the detained,George B. Sánchez-Tello,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/ice-health-scares-for-detained/,"Families of detained immigrants describe what many studies have found: ICE centers are ill-equipped to care for people with chronic illness, causing more suffering and death","After five months in Adelanto, an immigration detention facility in Southern California’s high desert, Emma Marcela Crespin de Paz is home in Los Angeles. The 58-year-old food vendor was released in October after multiple hospitalizations while in federal custody. 
Before she was detained, De Paz had been coping with high blood pressure and diabetes — serious, chronic conditions. Her warrantless arrest and bail bond indicate she shouldn’t have been taken at all.
De Paz’s ordeal highlights both a public component of Trump-era immigration policy — racial profiling — and a burgeoning public health concern that’s hidden from view: the immigrant detention system is ill-equipped for the health needs of those in its care. 
Deaths in custody capture public attention, said Dr. Altaf Saadi, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where she is the associate director of its asylum clinic.
Less attention is paid to those with chronic illnesses, whose health needs are worsened by indefinite detention in a dragnet, she said. People like de Paz.
At least twice de Paz had to be hospitalized while being held by immigration officials; both times she was admitted without her family’s notification. Because ICE detained her without her medication, she only began receiving her pills after family and attorneys advocated for her wellbeing. 
Saadi’s research on the health and wellbeing of California’s immigrant detainees has over five years consistently raised concerns about detention facilities.  
“Detention center medical systems have limited health care services, are frequently under-staffed and are focused on managing acute care needs rather than chronic medical problems, resulting in medical neglect, delayed diagnoses and care and severe negative consequences, especially among trauma-exposed individuals,” Saadi and other researchers wrote in the Health and Human Rights Journal in 2020. 
Surviving ICE detention despite illness
“The reality is there are harms occurring on a daily basis that people are surviving because people are resilient,” Saadi said in a July interview. 
Interruptions of detainees’ regular medicine and treatment routines and ensuing physical harm are likely underreported and under-discussed in local media and communities, Saadi added. 
Emma de Paz arrived in the United States in 2001 from Chiquimulilla, in the Guatemalan state of Santa Rosa, said her brother, Carlos Barrera de Paz. 
In Guatemala, her family worked in agriculture, as well as construction and street vending. The journey from Guatemala to Los Angeles lasted about 25 days, Carlos explained, including a four-day walk through the Sonoran Desert.

In the United States, De Paz established herself as part of Los Angeles’ informal economy by becoming a regular vendor outside the Hollywood Home Depot. She was known for Guatemalan favorites — black beans, hoof soup, and Guatemalan barbeque.
She also became part of a movement to legalize street vending in Los Angeles, explained Sergio Jimenez of Community Power Collective, a grassroots collective of tenants, street vendors & transit riders working for what they call a “solidarity economy.” 
Recently, about the time de Paz returned from detention, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation that de Paz had helped advocate for, to prevent immigration officials from accessing street vendors’ personal information from the licensing process. 
De Paz’ brother, Carlos, described his sister’s and family’s struggles with immigration enforcement.
 A family’s search amid hospitals’ silence
It began June 19, less than two weeks after federal officials began aggressive raids at a downtown L.A. warehouse and nearby Home Depot. Agents picked up De Paz and took her to the Metropolitan Detention Center downtown. She didn’t have her medicine with her.
De Paz ended up hospitalized nearby at White Memorial Hospital in Boyle Heights. Neither hospital nor immigration officials notified de Paz’s family. Instead they found out through a network of immigrant advocates working to alert communities to raids, identify those taken and track their well being. 
Carlos called the hospital in Boyle Heights and asked, in English, if his sister was there, if she was doing well or needed help. But hospital staff would not confirm she was there nor comment on her wellbeing, he said. 
Jimenez and her family later learned ICE agents were in de Paz’s room and in the adjacent hallway. Jimenez has met with doctors, nurses, surgeons and dieticians who have raised ethical concerns about ICE presence.
Throughout the summer, L. A. media reported on the presence of ICE in hospital lobbies and patient rooms. The nation’s nursing union has been advocating for the rights of immigrant patients in custody. Even White Memorial released ICE guidelines, though doctors and advocates said they fall short.
“This is a violation of patients’ rights,” Jimenez said. “Medical professionals are questioning the presence of ICE and the lack of (patient) access to their medication.”
Treating ill immigrants poorly
After 10 days in downtown Los Angeles, de Paz was transferred to the Adelanto Detention Center, a private prison operated by GEO Group. 
In her first week there, she again was without medication and was given food considered harmful for patients with diabetes and high blood pressure. For instance, de Paz was fed Capri sun and sandwiches for lunch, Jimenez and her family said.
“All that is jeopardizing her health,” Jimenez said. “The conditions don’t change.”
While in Adelanto, de Paz was hospitalized again. The family is still not sure where because, again, hospital staff would not confirm her visit. The family received no explanation or paperwork about the hospitalization. 
De Paz told her family the hospital did not provide translation services for her to communicate with the doctor or nurses. 
Instances of poor treatment and health care for immigrants at Adelanto have long been documented.
A 2018 Homeland Security Inspector General report titled “Management Alert – Issues Requiring Action at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in Adelanto, California,” includes a subsection titled “Failure to Provide Timely and Adequate Medical Care for Detainees Increases Health Risks.” 
The report states detainees are not ensured appropriate or necessary medical and dental care. Inspectors note doctors spoke in English to Spanish-speakers who did not understand what was said. The report also notes inspectors discovered nooses made from bed sheets, hanging from vents; detainees in interviews gave a variety of reasons for the sheets, including for failed suicide attempts. 
A year after that report, the California Department of Justice published a review of immigration detention facilities in California, complying with a law passed in 2017. The review said inspections at 10 facilities — including county jails, private prisons and Adelanto — revealed universal problems with medical record keeping, nurses practicing outside their legal scope, inadequate exams, inadequate medical care, inadequate mental health staffing and unsafe suicide watch and solitary confinement practices. 
The report noted that Adelanto was the most difficult source for obtaining medical files. Also, California’s DOJ requested a two-week inspection of Adelanto, but ICE allowed investigators in for only one day and did not permit them to speak with any detainees or staff. 
Evidence of medical harm
Detention facilities and staff are not prepared to adequately address the health needs of detainees and are harmful, Saadi reported in 2021 in the Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities. 
That same year, in the Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health, Saadi and another researcher reported on health needs for immigrant detainees amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Noting the lack of public data on detainees with chronic health needs, they identified a 2013-2014 survey of 565 detainees in four California facilities — three jails and one private prison. 
Researchers found 42.5% of respondents had at least one diagnosed medical condition and 15.5% had multiple chronic conditions. About 28% of detainees reported a combination of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, about 17% had neuropsychiatric conditions and nearly 9% reported lung disease. 
Of the individuals with known health conditions and treatment, about 21% experienced disruption in care upon entering detention, as did nearly 32% of individuals with two or more conditions.
In January 2025, across a pair of peer-reviewed journals — the Journal of the American Medical Association and the Journal of Migration and Health — Saadi and her colleagues again warned about the health dangers of migrant detention, concluding: “The most effective harm-reduction policy would be to end the use of incarceration in immigration legal proceedings.” 
Healing at home 
It will take more attention to research like Saadi’s and the stories of detained immigrants like de Paz for the public to understand the degree of medical harm resulting from Trump-era raids and arrests, to ensure it doesn’t happen again.
Meanwhile, de Paz has said she does not want to speak to reporters about her experience. When she returned home in October, the Los Angeles Times noted a tremor in her hands that hadn’t been there before her detention. 
“She’s gone through a lot of trauma, and she’s asked to take a break while she heals,” explained Jimenez. 
She has since made progress. For Thanksgiving de Paz returned to the Home Depot parking lot where she had been detained. She gave plates of homemade turkey in pipián, a traditional Guatemalan dish, to the day laborers there.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/070125-Emma-de-Paz-Protest-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C698&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-02 08:56:15.922488

Maura Healey is proposing a new requirement to mandate the flood disclosures as a means of steering people out of harm’s way in the first place.","DENISE KRESS HAS been living for 35 years with the Belle Isle Marsh as her backyard. 
But as more severe storms hit over the past decade, her life has been consumed by the marsh in ways other than its natural beauty: thinking about water, preparing for its encroachment, laying down bags of sand, living through flooding, and recovering from its wreckage. It’s meant two totaled cars and five repaired or replaced electrical and heating systems, and weeks spent in a hotel in the winter of 2018 after flood waters breached her basement twice in two months and then froze so that you’d need a “pick axe” to navigate it. 
Through all this, she’s stayed. 
But Kress occasionally ponders what it will look like, when the day comes, to sell her house just over the Boston border in Winthrop, given all the flooding the property has endured.  
“I can’t worry about it because there’s little that I can do about it,” Kress said when asked if she’s concerned that disclosing her home’s flooding history could impact its value. “But I would want the next owner to know. People have a right to know.” 
She’s quick to add, though, that even if she had known all the flood damages and insurance price hikes that would come in her 35 years in Winthrop, she may not have changed a thing anyway: “If I had to do it all over again, I probably would,” said Kress, who finds comfort in the vast marsh that drew her to the property originally. 
Such are the complications facing Massachusetts, a high-cost coastal state seeing some of the fastest-warming ocean temperatures in the world and increasing rates of precipitation that are exposing its aging stormwater drainage systems, dams, and culverts.

Gov. Maura Healey aims to direct a new influx of cash to address those very issues through her nearly $3 billion environmental bond bill, which includes $308 million to upgrade high-risk dams and flood control systems and nearly $100 million for coastal initiatives like seawalls, jetties, and beach nourishments. But as flooding touches more Massachusetts households, she’s also proposing a new requirement to steer people out of harm’s way in the first place: mandating flood risk disclosure when property owners sell. 
Massachusetts is one of just 14 states in the nation and one of just three located along the coast (Virginia and Georgia are the others) not to require flood disclosures, which are meant to arm prospective homebuyers with knowledge of a property’s past flooding history. Healey’s proposal comes as state leaders push to build more homes to ease high prices, including a goal to construct 220,000 more units by 2035 and a major zoning overhaul designed to increase housing around MBTA rail stops.  
“The flood disclosure provision is about consumer protection,” Katherine Antos, the state’s undersecretary for decarbonization and resilience, said in an interview. “Oftentimes, what families pay for their housing, whether they’re making one of the largest financial decisions of buying a home, or if they’re renting, this is a significant portion of their expenses. Making sure that they have available information about flood risk is key to helping them make informed decisions, including ways that they can keep themselves and their property safe.” 
Healey’s bill will now need action in the Legislature, and it arrived there earlier this year with broad support from the business community to the insurance industry to municipalities.  
But there’s one stakeholder key to the state’s efforts to address both a dire shortage in homes and a growing need to shore up current and future housing stock against flood risk that is keeping mum on the disclosure push: the real estate industry.  
Theresa Hatton, CEO of the Massachusetts Association of Realtors, said that she’s neutral on the proposed flood disclosure requirement. But she cautioned that moving ahead with the policy would upend Massachusetts’s structure as a “buyer beware” state — meaning the burden falls mostly on the buyer to proactively investigate issues with the home. 
“Flooding will affect the price of a home in terms of the insurance that you’ll have to pay,” she said. “In some cases, a buyer may decide, ‘This is not the home for me. I’d rather put this money into my mortgage as opposed to flood insurance.’ And others might say, ‘This is the most beautiful piece of property I’ve ever seen. I’m willing to take the risk and invest in flood insurance.’ To each their own — the more information, the better-informed decision you can make. But this is a systematic change that I don’t believe is the biggest priority to tackle at the moment. Let’s get some more housing built first.”  
Daryl Fairweather, chief economist of real estate firm Redfin, told CommonWealth Beacon that she supports mandatory flood disclosures — but acknowledged that “there are people who disagree with me in the real estate industry.” 
“If the seller is aware of flood risk and the buyer is not, then that gives an advantage to the seller during the negotiation process,” Fairweather said. “It’s better for there to be more even footing between seller and buyer. And on a more macro level, anything that helps homebuyers make better economic decisions, the more it will help the economy overall. Otherwise, we could have a situation where homebuyers are not at all aware of the risks, they go buying homes with high risk unwittingly, and then they end up needing bailouts from the government or insurance companies.” 
Supporters of Healey’s proposal in Massachusetts recognize the real estate industry could play a pivotal role in whether the state is able to enact a flood disclosure requirement. Norman Abbott, senior government affairs specialist at the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, said the sector is “an influential group” and that “this may be an issue where we ultimately don’t see eye to eye.” 
Sen. Rebecca Rausch, a Democrat who co-chairs the Joint Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, declined to say in an interview whether she’s concerned that the real estate industry could serve as a roadblock to the flood disclosure provision. 
But she added that “flood risk is only going to increase” — and with that risk comes a potential financial reckoning for property owners.  
“So whether [owners are] required to talk about it or not, the value is going to be impacted,” Rausch said.  
Joel Scata, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council who leads the group’s flood disclosure scorecard project, said real estate agents in other “buyer beware” states have opposed flood disclosure requirements because of a “misconstrued fear that this is going to hamper the real estate industry even though many other states have strong disclosure laws and still have strong real estate markets.” 
Luck might play a role, too.  
David Melly, a senior policy director at the Environmental League of Massachusetts, said that Massachusetts has avoided the flood disclosure conversation in recent years in part because it has largely been spared from devastating and headline grabbing major hurricanes with statewide impacts. New Jersey and New York, for instance, enacted flood disclosure laws in 2023 in the wake of hurricanes Sandy and Ida that battered those coastlines, flooded subway systems, and knocked out power for a large swath of people for an extended period of time.  
Still, between dramatic coastal erosion along bluffs and beaches in the state and crushing inland flooding in communities like Leominster in recent years, Healey’s bond bill would strengthen stormwater management systems and establish a revolving fund to implement upgrades to roads, bridges, dams, and salt marsh restoration projects. 
The flood disclosure requirement in particular is one that Carole McCauley wishes had already been in place when she sold her flood-prone Salem home a decade ago. 
McCauley, a single mother who used to work in the state’s Office of Coastal Zone Management and is now at Mass Audubon, would often park her car up the street on safer ground because the drains in front of her house would regularly overflow, with water spreading out over the road and bubbling up the sidewalk and onto her front steps. She became accustomed to watching the tide charts daily. 
But everything changed when a microburst of intense rain woke her up one morning in October 2011. She ran downstairs to find that three feet of water had poured into her basement, despite three sump pumps, and later learned she had lost a water heater and had her car totaled from the storm.

When McCauley found out a few years later that her mortgage lender was going to require her to purchase flood insurance, McCauley decided it was time to move. 
But she didn’t disclose the flooding history to the next owner. 
“I felt like a real jerk,” McCauley said. “I remember having a conversation with the realtor, and he’s like, ‘Are you going to disclose?’ He just looked at me, like, ‘I’m your agent, and this is your money. What do you want me to do?’ They’re not making us do it. Hold your nose, and off you go.” 
The experience changed her thinking on flooding, climate change, and even capitalism. 
“This is not even just about convincing people that science is real and here’s something science is telling us,” McCauley said. “Now we’re telling people that their retirement, their future, their savings is at risk if their property values are impacted. But it is a very painful step in the right direction to require the mandatory disclosures. It’s not going to convince some people – some people can afford the loss, and some people just don’t believe it. But if they don’t believe it, it’s only because they have never lived through what it’s like to have all your family photos gone because they’re soaked in mud.” 
The proposed flood disclosure requirement isn’t necessarily just to benefit buyers, either.  
Fairweather, Redfin’s chief economist, said if sellers knew their flood history would be disclosed, they could be nudged into taking additional steps to help mitigate against any damage such disclosures could do to their property value by investing in new gutters, for instance, or redoing their landscaping to navigate water away from the home. 
Now, Healey’s flood disclosure proposal will barrel forward into next year and stands to offer an early glimpse into the policy jockeying to come over how Massachusetts handles its growing flood problem.  
“Choosing not to disclose isn’t necessarily the answer, because it’s almost like a perverse game of musical chairs,” said Scata, the senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Eventually, someone’s going to be left holding that property that’s untenable because it floods so often.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0414-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-02 08:56:15.922488

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Two nonprofits have given Fairhope Public Library over $42,000 to offset state aid lost in a dispute between the library and the Alabama Public Library Service (APLS) board over content in the teens’ section of the library.
The donation from Read Freely Alabama and EveryLibrary Institute came weeks after the library learned the state had canceled and reallocated $22,000 in funding that library officials had understood to be suspended pending resolution of the dispute.
“We are really excited, to finally at long last, be handing over this money that was raised by the community, by the people of Alabama, and by many of the people around the world who saw the plight of our library and stood up, and opened their pocketbooks to help our library stand up to censorship,” said Elizabeth Williams, one of the members of Read Feely Alabama who helped create the GoFundMe account. “Now that APLS has made clear that they have no intention of returning our funding anytime soon, we are going to release this money.”

Williams said that the Board of Trustees for the Fairhope Public Library requested that the two groups delay donating the funds that were raised until APLS eventually decided on the fate of the library’s funding.
“Obviously we are very excited and appreciate the support of the community so much,” said Robert Gourlay, director of the Fairhope Public Library. “That is unbelievable, the amount of funds that were raised and the true show of support from the community.”
A message was sent to John Wahl, chair of the APLS Board and the Alabama Republican Party, on Monday.
APLS told Fairhope Public Library Board Chair Randal Wright last month that it had disbursed the money that it had been withholding from Fairhope to other libraries in Baldwin County.
The board suspended the final two installments of Fairhope’s state aid for the 2025 fiscal year in March. APLS Board Member Amy Minton moved to hold the funds after a handful of individuals from Fairhope accused the library of shelving  books in the teen section that they considered sexually explicit, in violation of APLS administrative code updates from last year.
The administrative code changes required that local libraries, as a condition for receiving state aid, create policies that further restrict minors from having access to library materials considered obscene, sexually explicit or otherwise inappropriate.
The Fairhope Public Library Board reviewed 17 books that were challenged after the APLS Board suspended its funding. Board members decided to reshelve seven titles to the adult section while keeping the remaining books where they were originally located.
Library officials  said they did not receive any notice from APLS that they were not complying with the regulations indicated in the administrative code.
Read Freely Alabama, with assistance from the EveryLibrary Institute, started a fundraiser by creating a GoFundMe account to help offset what was considered a temporary funding loss at the time.
APLS last month approved additional changes forbidding libraries from shelving books for children or teenagers that contain “gender ideology,” a term it does not define, and those that address “the concept of more than two biological genders.”
“The board of the Alabama Public Library Service was very clear that it does not believe that LBGTQ+ identity should be on the shelves of public libraries, and that is a tragedy,” said John Chrastka, executive director of EveryLibrary Institute. “So, we wanted to step up and help safeguard that library from what was essentially blackmail on the part of the board, trying to force them to remove content that is otherwise legal.”
APLS continues to withhold funding from the Fairhope Public Library. APLS board members delayed making a final decision at the meeting in September on whether to reinstate funding for Fairhope to allow themselves time to read the books themselves.
Wahl said at last month’s meeting that he had not read the materials that were challenged and requested that his fellow board members delay deciding on the fate of Fairhope’s funding until the meeting scheduled for early next year so that he could have additional time to read the books and report his findings to board members.
Thus far, Fairhope Public Library remains out of compliance with the administrative code and has not received any state aid since the APLS Board voted in March.
The Fairhope community has rallied behind the library amid the ongoing battle. City leaders have expressed support for the library, and Fairhope voters largely rejected a slate of candidates backed by library opponents this summer.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_7721-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 08:56:15.922488

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Rocky Mountain Power is proposing a 4.48% rate increase for all customers, potentially for the next decade. However, this time, the adjustment isn’t meant to cover its expenses, but a self-insurance account that would cover extraordinary expenses in case of utility-related catastrophic wildfires.
The company’s request stems from a law the Utah Legislature passed in 2024, which, among other provisions, allowed large utilities to establish a restricted fire fund fed by a surcharge to ratepayers. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, who sponsored the law in the 2024 session, said the adjustment was driven by commercial insurance prices going “astronomically high,” especially after PacifiCorp settled a lawsuit with about 400 plaintiffs over deadly wildfires that devastated Oregon communities in 2020.
“The idea here is, if Rocky Mountain Power would have to go out and purchase insurance at the higher level, that cost would be blended back into the rates that we’re paying today,” Sandall told Utah News Dispatch on Monday. “So rather than pay the extra high cost of the additional insurance to an insurance company, the idea here is to self insure to a certain degree.”
Commission orders 4.7% electricity rate increase, a quarter of Rocky Mountain Power’s proposal

According to November testimonies from Rocky Mountain Power executives, the proposed 4.48% increase would translate to about $3.70 a month for the average residential customer, the cap established in the bill. With the increase, the company is hoping to collect about $109 million a year, and eventually, after 10 years, about $1 billion.
Rocky Mountain Power argued in its request for the rate increase that the proposal is in the public interest, especially now that “the increasing incidence and severity of wildland fire has put unprecedented financial pressure on electric utilities operating in Western states like Utah.”
“The availability of the Fire Fund supports customers and the state of Utah generally by fostering the financial stability of the Company so it can deploy capital to effectively serve customers,” the company wrote. “Massive claims on utility assets arising from wildfire liability could compromise the Company’s ability to expand infrastructure to meet current customer needs and expected load growth in Utah.”
The code establishes that the fire fund would supplement other forms of insurance. And Sandall highlighted the account would not be part of Rocky Mountain Power’s system. It would instead be a restricted account, and would only be used as a last resort if there’s a catastrophic fire with liabilities that insurance won’t pay for.
“This is just an insurance account that the ratepayers pay into, but it’s always there,” Sandall said. “And if something else comes up in the future where we don’t need it, I’m sure that we’ll give it back to the ratepayers.”



Let us know what you think...


 


The hope is that Rocky Mountain Power still takes the necessary measures to avoid fires by keeping their power lines clear and cutting energy in high wind situations, Sandall said, and that the state isn’t forced to use the account.
“They just were really at a point where the insurance companies, especially after the Oregon lawsuit, did not want to insure them at a reasonable rate,” Sandall said. “And so this becomes a self-insured fund, rather than pay the extra high premiums to an insurance company.”
Rocky Mountain Power’s request was expected after the passage of Sandall’s legislation. However, it also comes after a controversial request for a 30.5% residential rate increase, heavily criticized by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox and legislative leaders. Ultimately, the Utah Public Service Commission approved only a 4.7% bump, which would translate into a $4.31 increase in the average home’s utility bill. 
However, Sandall reiterated the fire fund is different from the general rate because the money would not pay for Rocky Mountain Power’s regular operations.

,California,2025-12-02 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom’s 911 debacle is California’s latest failed tech adoption,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/california-tech-911-system-failed/,Since 2019 California has spent $450 million on a new 911 system. This year the  Newsom administration declared it unworkable and will start over.,"Six years ago, shortly after the Legislature enacted his first state budget, Gov. Gavin Newsom embarked on a celebratory tour to tout the spending plan’s major provisions.
Newsom’s last stop was in San Francisco, where he bragged about increasing fees on telephone service to finance an upgrade of California’s 911 emergency communication system, whose deficiencies had become painfully apparent during a series of destructive and deadly wildfires.
“During my first week in office, I proposed making crucial updates to modernize our antiquated 911 system,” Newsom said during a media event. “The idea that it’s 2019, and we are using analog systems designed decades ago is astounding, and we need to make investments to make sure the technology aligns with the devices people are using in their daily lives.
“California’s antiquated, analog microwave network must be upgraded to a digital network to maintain safety operations that can integrate into the 21st century technology everyone is using,” Newsom added.
Fast forward to 2025. Wildfires still plague the state, including the massively destructive fires that swept through Los Angeles neighborhoods. Californians also remain at risk from earthquakes and floods, not to mention crimes and medical crises. 
They still are depending on an emergency communication system that Newsom denounced as antiquated. What happened to the promised upgrade?
Since 2019 the state has spent $450 million on a new system, but this year Newsom’s administration threw in the towel, abandoning what had already been built and declaring it unworkable and that the process must start all over again.
The Sacramento Bee laid out what happened — or didn’t happen — in a lengthy piece of investigative journalism:
“California settled on a design that no other state had implemented: a regionalized approach that divided the massive state into four sectors.
“Between 2019 and 2025, California paid four technology companies over $450 million to build out its Next Generation 911 system, a more advanced emergency communication tool that would provide dispatchers with enhanced location services and other ways for the public to communicate with first responder operators.
“But when the time came to turn that system on, it didn’t work.”
In 2024, California’s Office of Emergency Services switched on a few dispatch centers as a test and discovered that it was operationally so flawed that officialdom “decided to scrap the regional design and go back to the drawing board,” the Bee found. The state now proposes a new design similar to what other states have adopted. Cal OES will seek proposals next year for a substitute, the Bee reported, “at an additional cost of potentially hundreds of millions of dollars.”
The failure is not just money down the drain. It compels Californians to continue relying on a system whose shortcomings put their lives and property in jeopardy.
Sadly too, the 911 debacle is not an isolated case of inept technological adoption — even though California is the global leader in cutting edge tech and its governor once wrote a book outlining how it would transform governance.
The governmental landscape is littered with information technology projects that have failed to deliver the promised benefits, have experienced huge cost overruns or have been abandoned.
The poster child is the state’s most ambitious technology project, called the Financial Information System for California, or FI$Cal for short,  launched in 2005 as a one-stop application for managing state finances. It has consumed more than a billion dollars, is many years overdue and is not likely to be completed until sometime in the next decade, if ever.
The common denominator, demonstrated anew in the 911 project, is the effort to create something new, rather than relying on systems with proven functionality — which is the bureaucratic equivalent of reinventing the wheel.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/080819-911-Center-SF-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-02 08:56:15.922488

The meeting can be viewed virtually at this link by entering the password “Council2.” 
The council, formed earlier this year by state lawmakers, is tasked with overseeing most of the money won from companies that contributed to Mississippi’s opioid epidemic — a public health crisis that’s led to over 10,000 deadly overdoses since 2000. State officials have been receiving tens of millions of settlement dollars since 2022 but haven’t spent the money on anything other than attorneys’ fees yet. 
Earlier this year, organizations across the state and country submitted 126 applications for money overseen by the council, which the office of Mississippi Attorney General and Council Chair Lynn Fitch said in November has accumulated to around $100 million. The council members reviewed those applications in private subcommittees this fall and scored them on a 0-100 point scale. 
At the last meeting in November, the members agreed to use Tuesday’s meeting to more thoroughly evaluate 59 applications that scored highly on the scale. They also voted to review a roughly $9 million application for opioid wastewater surveillance, a concept State Health Officer and Co-Vice Council Chair Dr. Dan Edney said had little utility. 
Most of the money requested in the highly-scored applications are coming from organizations with at least one representative on the council. Some council members, applicants without representation and addiction experts said they thought the process has favored committee members’ organizations. Michelle Williams, Fitch’s chief of staff, told Mississippi Today that members of the council are leaders in addressing the state’s addiction crisis, and it would harm the state’s public health response to exclude them from the application process. 
State law requires the council to submit recommendations to the Legislature by Dec. 7 — 30 days before the start of the 2026 regular legislative session. During the session, lawmakers are expected to approve or deny those recommendations and begin appropriating the state’s opioid settlement money.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/03144450/Opioid-Settlement-Fund-Advisory-Committee-meeting1.jpg,,,2025-12-02 08:56:15.922488

Vaughn RMC is one of 50 rural hospitals that are eligible to receive funds through the Rural Hospital Investment Program. (Will McLelland for Alabama Reflector)A state board Monday approved a system of distributing private donations to rural hospitals, based on need. 
The Rural Health Investment Program Board will use three weighted criteria to approve the allocation of the money, made available through legislation passed earlier this year that created a dollar-for-dollar tax incentive program for individuals and businesses that donate to rural hospitals. 
“We just did a simple table where the hospital with the greatest need would get 100 points, the second greatest need would get 99 points,” Wesley Ashmore, vice president of finance at the Alabama Hospital Association, told the board Monday during its virtual meeting.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The board will use three weighted criteria to score hospitals’ needs. The “quick ratio” weight is current assets divided by current liabilities and accounts for 50% of a hospital’s rank. “Operating margin” is determined by the hospital’s net income from services to patients divided by operating revenues and accounts for 25% of the rank. “Uncompensated care” accounts for 25% and is determined by the hospital’s uncompensated care divided by operating expenses.
Each hospital is ranked on each weighted category, Ashmore said, which is then averaged for the hospital’s overall rank. Lake Martin Community Hospital ranked first overall and will fall into the first tier. Lake Martin and nine other hospitals will receive 30% of undesignated funds. 
Greene County Hospital ranked last overall and will fall into tier five. Greene County and nine other hospitals will receive 10% of undesignated funds. The board did not have all of Green County Hospital’s data, which led to its position.
Alabama State Treasurer Young Boozer complimented Ashmore’s methodology.
“It’s easy to understand, and I think it’s going to be a very positive impact and it will be something that will be able to be used for some time,” Boozer said.
According to the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center, nine rural hospitals have closed in Alabama since 2009. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care. Alabama is one of ten states that has not expanded Medicaid. Alabama’s hospitals have long pushed for expansion, saying it would help hospitals on the brink of collapse survive, but Republican leaders have resisted it.
While Alabama House leaders have signaled openness to a public-private hybrid approach to expansion, the Senate has been hostile, and removed a provision from a 2024 gambling bill that could have provided money for the program.  
The donation program approved by the Alabama Legislature earlier this year has an annual statewide cap of $20 million for 2026, $25 million for 2027 and $30 million for 2028 and beyond. It requires a 10% match from local communities. 
In November, board members and Danne Howard, president of the Alabama Hospital Association, said the program will help, but would not save a hospital in danger of closing.
“It was never intended to be something that would prevent or save all of the rural hospitals, because it can’t, it won’t,” Howard said in an interview in November. “It is an opportunity for community engagement, for community support of their hospitals, to get some much needed cash into a rural hospital that has needs for something.”
The board approved funding for 50 hospitals at its meeting last month, which will be displayed on the Alabama Department of Revenue’s website. Donations made without designating a specific hospital will be distributed based on a weighted five-tier system. There will be 10 hospitals in each tier.
Alabama’s rural hospitals will also be receiving funding from the federal Rural Health Transformation Program, part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) that was signed into law this summer. It distributes $50 billion in grants to the states over five years for rural health care. According to a brief from KFF, a national health policy research organization, the fund could offset just over a third (37%) of the estimated federal Medicaid spending cuts in rural areas, which are projected to be $137 billion over ten years.
Gov. Kay Ivey’s office announced that the state submitted its application to the federal government last month. 
Rob Pearson, chair of the board, said he is happy with how the undesignated funds tier came together.
“I believe we’ve got something that the Legislature intended.If there’s any adjustments to be made, we’ll get back with them, but it’s certainly something that will be supported statewide,” Pearson said. “I look forward to seeing it improve our rural hospitals around the state.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VaughanRegionalMedicalCenter_McLelland12878-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 08:56:15.922488

The Toronto-based corporation’s board of directors has authorized Barrick to explore an initial public offering that would consist of Barrick’s mines in Nevada as well as its Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic.
Barrick has mines spanning the globe — in South America, the Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan, and multiple African nations. 
Some of those projects have given the company headaches. A dispute over revenue sharing at a mining complex in the West African nation of Mali resulted in Barrick losing administrative control, the project getting shut down, and four employees detained for a year. Barrick announced last month that it entered an agreement that resolved the disputes, assured release of the employees, and would “pave the way for a constructive path forward.”
Shareholders have also groused about geopolitical risks and potentially inferior (compared to gold) economic potential at Barrick’s massive copper mining complex in Pakistan.
Barrick’s board earlier this year was reportedly mulling the sale of African holdings as well as the project in Pakistan.
Creating a North American subsidiary would stop short of that, while still providing shareholders some separation.
“We are singularly focused on driving improved performance and shareholder value,” Barrick CEO Mark Hill said in a statement announcing the prospect of a Nevada-centric subsidiary Monday.
An IPO for an entity consisting of Barrick’s North American mines “could give new and existing shareholders more optionality around jurisdiction in a pure gold company with growth,” Hill said.
Barrick is the operator of Nevada Gold Mines, a joint venture with Newmont Corporation. Last year, the venture accounted for more than two-thirds of the gold mined in Nevada.
The price of gold has skyrocketed more than 60 percent in 2025, setting all time highs well above $4,000 an ounce.

Instead of demanding that school districts curb their spending, the task force suggested a process in which districts collaborate, with lots of support and help from the Agency of Education, to find ways to save money.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jack Hoffman: Seize the opportunity for a second chance on school reform.","Jack Hoffman is a senior policy analyst with the Public Assets Institute. Before joining Public Assets, Jack covered politics and state government in Vermont for 20 years. 


The Act 73 redistricting task force wrapped up their work, and they’ve given the state a chance to rethink the course of education reform it has been pursuing for the last decade.
Vermont communities, as well as elected leaders, should seize this opportunity to get us out of the ditch we’ve been in and refocus on what should be our priority: ensuring our kids have what they need to thrive. 
The 168-page draft proposal from the Nov. 10 meeting of the task force had a lot to digest. And it requires close reading because the proposal offers much more nuanced analyses of problems confronting the education system than we’ve seen from the administration or the Legislature in recent years. The task force also put out a more streamlined draft report along with an explanation of the changes. 
One of the group’s most important recommendations is to stop further forced consolidation of school districts, which fits with one of the task force’s guiding principles: do no harm.
It’s not that the committee opposes mergers. It recommends voluntary consolidation for some districts in certain circumstances, which was the state’s policy before passage of Act 46 a decade ago. 
Like all recent education reform plans, the redistricting task force focused on costs. But it didn’t offer the usual “we have to do something about Vermont’s skyrocketing education spending” refrain, which has pitted the administration and the Legislature against local school officials for too long. Instead of demanding that school districts curb their spending, the task force suggested a process in which districts collaborate, with lots of support and help from the Agency of Education, to find ways to save money.
The report includes examples of potential cost savings, and none of them appear to require an overhaul of the education financing system. For example, the task force pointed to areas where public schools have seen a rise in per pupil spending because they’ve lost students to independent schools. (School taxes are tied to per-pupil costs, so a decline in students can drive up taxes.) Fixing this would require changes to how we pay for tuition students, which is not addressed in Act 73.
The proposal also pushed back against some of the conventional wisdom that has grown up around Vermont’s education system, like the idea that larger schools are more efficient and produce better outcomes than smaller ones, or that small schools need to close because it’s the small communities that are losing students.
The report referenced other cost drivers, but not in much detail because they were beyond the scope of the committee’s mission. They deserve mention, though, because they go to the heart of perhaps the most consistent complaint about Vermont’s funding system: per pupil spending
Vermont spends more than most other states and has for a long time. In recent years, the cost of health care — especially mental health care — has been a big factor. But that’s a problem for many businesses and individuals in Vermont, not the fault of the school funding system.
The task force also noted that Vermont spends a bigger share of its education budget on social services than neighboring states. That’s in part because other states pay for services through the general state budget — and perhaps through county budgets in some cases — that Vermont covers through the Education Fund. Moving costs from the education fund to the general fund wouldn’t eliminate them, but it would relieve pressure on education property taxes — and lower Vermont’s average per pupil spending. 
Vermont saw an unusual jump in education spending and school taxes in fiscal 2025, which set off the current scramble to remake the state’s education funding system. But some homeowners are getting hit with tax increases not tied to spending increases. There are ways to address those jumps and make the tax system fairer without the disruption of more consolidation or upending the entire system. But that, too, was beyond the scope of the task force’s mission and can be addressed separately. 
What the redistricting task force has laid out is a more nuanced approach that has a better chance of gaining public acceptance than something imposed by Montpelier. It will require
addressing a lot of specific problems rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. And it offers greater opportunity for local community engagement, which is critical to making any change work.
At a time when democracy is under threat across the country, it makes sense to protect and preserve it here at home — for our communities and our kids.

(Getty Images)Indiana hospitals are making progress toward lowering health care costs, according to new national rankings and reports.
Multiple analyses highlighted Monday by the Indiana Hospital Association showed improved hospital pricing and more cost-effective care for Hoosiers.
Recent data from WalletHub placed Indiana as the 8th-best state in the nation for health care costs in 2025, up from 15th in 2021.
The ranking was based on multiple metrics: the cost of a medical visit; average hospital expenses per inpatient day at community hospitals; the cost of a dental visit; average monthly insurance premiums; the share of the population under 65 with high out-of-pocket medical spending relative to income; and the share of adults who forgo doctor visits due to cost.
IHA officials said the improvement reflects the impact of “hospital-led” efforts to contain costs and increase efficiency across the state’s health system.
The same WalletHub rankings placed Indiana 20th in the country for access to health care services and 36th for health care outcomes, which included rates for infant and maternal mortality; childhood immunizations; cancer incidence; and life expectancy.
Story continues below.
Health Care Affordability
 
Indiana placed 22nd in the overall “Best Health Care Systems” list.
IHA separately pointed to a 2024 Forbes report that ranked Indiana 24th out of 50 states in health care costs — a jump of 13 spots from its 2023 position as the 11th-highest.
Indiana was ranked the 10th worst state for health care in an earlier 2023 Forbes study due to a combination of high costs, poor patient outcomes and issues with overall access to care. The study emphasized a low number of primary care physicians per capita and high average insurance deductibles across Indiana, but the state received its lowest score for hospital care quality.
A different 2024 Forbes analysis ranked Indiana 7th worst for health care access, similarly citing high costs and lagging outcomes.
Hoosier hospital officials maintain they’ve increased price transparency and expanded tools to help patients compare costs and quality. Some of this was spurred by legislative efforts.
Further data cited by IHA shows that employer-based health insurance premiums have remained at or below the national average since 2020. The association suggested that reductions in hospital costs “are helping to keep premiums in check for families and businesses.”
RAND Corporation studies also show a “consistent” downward trend in hospital pricing, according to IHA. Indiana moved from the most expensive state in the 2019 RAND 2.0 report to ninth in last year’s RAND 5.1 analysis, surpassing eight other states in five years. 
IHA leaders have previously raised concerns about RAND’s methodology but said Monday that “consistent improvement across reports points to meaningful progress.”
Hoosier employers increasingly turn to self-insured plans to trim costs

“Indiana hospitals are committed to making care more affordable without compromising quality,” said IHA President Scott Tittle. “These rankings reflect the hard work and collaboration happening across the state to lower costs and improve access for Hoosiers.”
“Indiana’s trajectory stands out nationally,” he continued. “We’re controlling costs better than many states and making measurable improvements relative to the rest of the country.”
Additional IHA data shows a 7% drop in the share of median income spent on health care since 2020, and national rankings now place Indiana among the ten most affordable states for health care.
The improvements come amid broader conversations at both the state and national levels about rising health care costs.
Among the numerous health care measures signed into state law earlier this year, House Enrolled Act 1004 now requires some of Indiana’s largest nonprofit hospital systems to lower prices or risk losing their nonprofit status.
Under the new law, prices for patient services must be capped at or below the level in effect on Jan. 1, 2025, through June 30, 2027. Lawmakers said the move aims to rein in hospital charges and increase financial accountability.
The policy also mandates audited financial reporting and gives state regulators the power to enforce price caps if hospitals exceed pre-set benchmarks.
Lawmakers also enacted House Enrolled Act 1003, which bolsters medical billing transparency across providers. The law requires hospitals and other medical providers to give clear price estimates to patients, standardize billing practices and forbids surprise fees.

You would be forgiven for thinking Michigan isn’t even holding an election for governor in 2026. While the race exists on paper, in press releases and in campaign finance filings, […]","A milk carton with a 'missing' poster of U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township) that supporters of Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt brought to Michigan Republican Party gubernatorial debate in Sparta, Mich. James was invited but did not attend. Oct. 29, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceNine months out from the 2026 Michigan gubernatorial primary, contenders for the Republican nomination are running like they have all the time in the world.
You would be forgiven for thinking Michigan isn’t even holding an election for governor in 2026. While the race exists on paper, in press releases and in campaign finance filings, few of the candidates have full-time staff, have spent meaningful money or have done anything more than make the rounds at rubber-chicken dinners hosted by county Republican parties. 
Republicans have a reasonably long front bench. Congressman John James, state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, former Attorney General Mike Cox and former Speaker of the House Tom Leonard all bring experience, fundraising capability and established networks of support. The others — who I won’t even name — are unlikely to make the ballot.
And yet, for all the theoretical strength, almost none of these campaigns resemble a serious statewide operation.
Republicans, if they want to take back the governor’s office, must start running a real race.
The political dynamics of 2026 — an open seat after eight years of Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and an electorate that remains deeply divided — theoretically favor a strong Republican nominee. Add in the wildcard of Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan’s faux independent bid and the race is even more ripe for a win. 
But that nominee must first run a campaign worthy of the office.
That means hiring real staff and putting them out front. It means building out an organization in all 83 counties. It means spending money instead of hoarding it. And it means making a public case for why each candidate should be governor, instead of waiting for a Truth Social notification that may never come.
Ask party insiders who is actually managing these campaigns and the answer is often a shrug, followed by a comment about consultants “helping informally.” Aside from an occasional press release touting how much cash they’ve raised, the kind of structure expected at this stage simply isn’t there. 
Endorsements are similarly scarce. 
Normally by now, you would see state legislators, party officials and grassroots activists pick sides. You would expect candidates to have a chair in every county. As of this writing, only Leonard and Nesbitt have released endorsements — and even then, we’re talking about a handful of names, maybe a dozen at most. Do any of these campaigns even have a statewide steering committee, let alone a campaign chairman? The silence is telling.
Contrast that with Lieutenant Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. Not only do the two Democrats do a stronger job touting endorsements, but their campaigns also appear to exist beyond the confines of social media feeds.
Among Republicans, it feels as if nobody wants to do anything substantive because President Donald Trump might post a late-night endorsement on Truth Social, thereby ending the race before it truly starts.
If that’s the strategy, it rests on shaky ground.
Trump’s 2026 endorsements have mostly focused on races for Congress. Whatever he ultimately decides, there’s little evidence he’s preparing to wade into the Michigan GOP’s gubernatorial primary. And even if he does, candidates cannot run a statewide campaign in a battleground state by holding their breath until absentee ballots drop in June. 
Elections are won by the candidates who show up. Right now, the would-be standard-bearers for Michigan Republicans aren’t showing up nearly enough.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA296081-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-02 07:57:19.474349

The latest twist came late last month when Attorney General Catherine Hanaway accused a company hired to collect signatures for the campaign of human trafficking. You read that right: Human trafficking. If […],"A polling location in Jefferson City (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri Republicans have been doing everything they can to block a referendum to put the state’s gerrymandered congressional map on the 2026 ballot. The latest twist came late last month when Attorney General Catherine Hanaway accused a company hired to collect signatures for the campaign of human trafficking.
You read that right: Human trafficking.
If true, it would be a massive scandal — and a grave tragedy. But so far, the only evidence Hanaway has cited are “reports.”
After she made the initial accusation on social media, we sought clarification from her office on where she heard these allegations, what “reports” she was referring to and what led her to believe they were credible enough to seek assistance from ICE, the federal agency that enforces immigration laws.
Her office didn’t respond.
A few days later, Hanaway issued a statement announcing she had launched a formal investigation into the allegations. So we asked again for any information about the source of these claims. And this time, Hanaway’s office was quick to respond to tell us that because there is now an active investigation, no information can legally be released.
Welp…
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee seized on the news, using it in a Black Friday–themed text blast to warn Missourians not to sign petitions from a group being investigated for “improper conduct.”
At the center of the accusation is Advanced Micro Targeting — the Dallas-based firm hired by a PAC called People Not Politicians to collect signatures. The allegation is that AMT is bringing undocumented immigrants into the state to assist with the campaign.
To put it another way, at a time when many immigrants — regardless of their legal status — live in fear of being detained and deported, AMT has allegedly been able to convince some to stand outside of government buildings with clipboards.
AMT has strongly denied the accusations. According to the company, all signature gatherers are vetted through the federal E-Verify system. Every petition form lists the name of the signature gatherer, and all forms are reviewed by a notary who checks the signature gatherer’s ID.
Adding to the drama, AMT filed a federal lawsuit alleging four consulting firms are involved in an effort to pay AMT employees to abandon their work, turn over any signatures they gathered and badmouth the company — all to sabotage the petition drive.
Some employees, according to the lawsuit, were offered up to $30,000 to quit and provide “intelligence” to opponents of the referendum.
In a recording provided to The Independent by a supporter of the referendum, an individual who approached signature gatherers in Kansas City is heard identifying himself as an employee of one of the firms named in the lawsuit, Let the Voters Decide.
Let the Voters Decide, which is based in Florida, called AMT’s litigation a “bogus lawsuit” full of “absurd claims.”
And so here we are: an alleged sabotage campaign; an immigration investigation; a federal lawsuit; and a litany of procedural roadblocks.
The GOP is pulling out all the stops to keep the gerrymandered map off the 2026 ballot.
It’s understandable. Of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the Missouri ballot, voters have rejected the General Assembly’s actions all but twice — including overturning a congressional map in 1922.
The fight over Missouri’s gerrymandered map seems destined to spiral deeper into political intrigue. What began as a dispute over lines on a map has now become a test of the state’s democratic backbone.

State Rep. Jim Murphy of St. Louis used the first day of pre-filing for the upcoming legislative session to introduce a bill to ban solicitations that include recurring donations. The bill also requires each solicitation to state “in a clear and conspicuous manner” the candidate or political action committee that will use the money.
“If you want it, you have to call them back every month,” Murphy said.
The bill, he said, is in response to a report in The Independent last month about how Eigel — who is running in the Republican primary for St. Charles County executive — is continuing to reap donations from people who gave to his unsuccessful bid for governor in 2024.
How a Nebraska veteran unwittingly became a repeat donor to a Missouri county campaign

Eigel attracted the out-of-state donors with strident messages on issues like immigration and by embracing Donald Trump, which drew a rebuke from the president’s campaign for using his name without permission. His campaign relies heavily on the work of a political action committee called BILL PAC, which provided $150,000 during the second quarter of the year.
BILL PAC solicitations this year have continued in the same vein. One sent in November accused Democrats of scheming to make citizens of undocumented immigrants, “permanently rigging the elections to vote Democrats for generations.” 
Another, headlined “Antifa Insurrection Warning,” told recipients: “They want to destroy our country through violent uprising to install a Socialist ‘utopia’ where the law of the land comes from leftist ideology, not morals or principles.” 
The appeals never mention Eigel or identify the purpose of BILL PAC, which is named as the recipient in small type at the bottom of the emails.
“I can’t speak to the motivation or what they were trying to do when they did what they did,” Murphy said, “but I don’t think it’s transparent enough, and I don’t think it’s fair.”
Eigel’s campaign did not respond to a message seeking comment.
The bill is the only one of more than 1,100 pieces of legislation filed Monday — 599 in the state Senate and 515 in the Missouri House — that addresses recurring political donations. The session starts Jan. 7.
The use of a pre-checked box to turn single donations into recurring donations has been incorporated into fundraising strategies for Democrats and Republicans and are often missed by unsophisticated donors, especially retirees.
Other states have proposed similar bans. Pennsylvania’s legislature considered a ban on the fundraising tactic in 2023, but it didn’t advance very far. New Jersey lawmakers pushed for a ban this year after reports in Politico about the fundraising of a Republican candidate for governor. 
The Federal Election Commission recommended a federal ban on pre-checked recurring donations in 2021 but Congress has not acted.
Russell Wood, 92, of Cambridge, Nebraska, agreed to make a donation to Eigel’s campaign for governor in 2023. The single donation became a recurring weekly donation that stopped for only a few weeks in 2024 between Eigel’s campaign for governor and county executive when he did not have an active committee.
Wood’s donations, $30 each week, totaled $1,050 by Sept. 30, the closing date of the most recent disclosure report. Reached by telephone Monday, Wood said he has not heard from the Eigel campaign since speaking to The Independent and he has been unsuccessful in stopping the payments.
There are additional charges on the latest bill from the credit card he used, Wood said. He called customer service to end the payments, he said.
“The person I talked to was a nitwit,” Wood said. “He said ‘we can’t do that without (the Eigel campaign’s) approval.’”
Wood is one of 141 people nationally — including six from Missouri — who made multiple donations to Eigel’s 2024 campaign for governor who are also contributors to his St. Charles County executive race. 
One retired woman in Texas, who made 143 donations to Eigel’s campaign for governor, has contributed $1,205 in 74 separate donations since December 2024.
Wood said he’s tried contacting the national Republican Party to stop the contributions, which he said were made initially in 2023 to support Republican candidates in five states. He is determined, he said, to stop the outflow of money.
“I am going to put the kibosh on this,” Wood said.
Eigel is relying heavily on the money from out-of-state donors to finance his campaign. The three-way primary includes incumbent Steve Ehlmann, executive since 2007, and Jason Law, mayor of Lake St. Louis.
Of the 1,074 itemized donations reported through Sept. 30 to Eigel’s campaign committee, only 11 are from Missouri, representing seven individual contributors. Only four live in St. Charles County. 
There are more contributors to Eigel from New Jersey, Florida, Texas and California than Missouri.
An independent political action committee formed to back Eigel’s political activities, BILL PAC, is also heavily dependent on recurring and out-of-state contributions. Of 3,679 itemized contributions this year to BILL PAC this year, only 137 are from within Missouri. Fewer than half that number are from constituents who could actually vote in next year’s county executive election.
The practice of autochecking boxes for recurring donations is “misleading, at best, and deceptive, at worst,” Murphy said.
“I’m here to protect our citizens,” he said. “I didn’t think that they were being properly protected, so therefore we’re going to try to fix it.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/022724_eigelfiling1-scaled-e1741631637688-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-12-02 07:57:19.474349

Advocates urge people to avoid blaming an entire community for the actions of an individual after an Afghan man was named a suspect in the shooting of National Guard members.

Federal immigration officials recently announced plans to re-examine the green cards of individuals from “19 high-risk countries” and conduct an assessment of country-specific factors for pending and future immigration requests, stirring worry among Vermont’s Afghan community, advocates say.
The announcement from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services came after an Afghan man was named as the suspect in the Wednesday shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. — Sarah Beckstrom, 20, who later died, and Andrew Wolfe, 24, hospitalized in critical condition.
The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, previously worked with the CIA in Afghanistan and was among more than 190,000 Afghans admitted into the U.S. after its withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.
The same day of the shooting, USCIS wrote on X, “Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols.”
Later, USCIS Director Joseph Edlow posted on Facebook that USCIS halted all asylum decisions “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”
Molly Gray, executive director of the Vermont Afghan Alliance, released a statement on Thanksgiving Day condemning the attack on National Guard members and affirming the organization’s support for Afghan allies in Vermont.
“The President’s response is deeply harmful, and spreads misinformation about Afghan allies and veterans who risked everything for this country,” the statement said, observing that the actions of one person shouldn’t be attributed to the entire Afghan community.
Afghans spent 21 years supporting U.S. missions in Afghanistan and risking their lives, and they fled to avoid persecution by the Taliban, the statement said. 
Afghans who resettled in Vermont contribute to the state’s workforce and economy, Gray told VTDigger. About 650 Afghans live in Vermont, working in fields such as manufacturing, health care, engineering, the service industry and small businesses, she said.
“It’s important that state leaders condemn the attack, but also ensure that Afghan community members across Vermont are not targeted and continue to feel safe and welcome,” Gray said, sharing that Afghans living in Vermont have already contacted the Alliance expressing their concerns.
According to a memo obtained by the Associated Press early last week — before the shooting — and signed by Edlow, the Trump administration was already planning a review and re-interview of all refugees admitted in the U.S. from Jan. 20, 2021, to Feb. 20, 2025.
But no official guidelines have been released on the matter, and local groups working with refugees are still waiting to see who is going to be impacted and how.
Tracy Dolan, director of the Vermont Refugee Office, also expressed her concern for the National Guard attack in D.C. and said the Afghan community is saddened by what happened.
“We’re hopeful that people understand that one person doesn’t represent an entire group, just like one refugee doesn’t represent all refugees,” Dolan said.
Dolan also emphasized that refugees who come to the U.S. are highly vetted in a process that can take months or even years.
“That is not just looking at any kind of criminal or legal history that they might have from where they’re coming from, but it also involves interviews and documentation of where they’ve been and who they’ve interacted with,” she said. “It is extensive, and it goes through several layers.”
Dolan said the Refugee Office plans to have meetings with refugees to support them and answer any questions they might have.
Gray said the Vermont Afghan Alliance will also work with attorneys statewide “to support Afghans as issues arise and reviews or re-examination happens.”

(Photo by Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)A whopping 13 Democrats and a single Republican filed petitions Monday to get on the ballot for the special primary election to replace Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill in Congress.
Most of the would-be candidates are not a surprise. They started announcing their bids to replace Sherrill, a Democrat, even before she won the governor’s race on Nov. 4. She resigned from Congress effective Nov. 20, leaving a vacancy in the 11th Congressional District until Jan. 3, 2027.
The special primary is slated for Thursday, Feb. 5.
The Democrats who hope to compete in the primary are: Passaic County Commissioner John Bartlett; Army veteran and businessman Zachary Beecher; attorney and comedian J-L Cauvin; former Sherrill intern Marc Chaaban; former Obama staffer Cammie Croft; Maplewood Committeeman Dean Dafis; Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill; Morris Township Committeeman Jeff Grayzel; ex-Rep. Tom Malinowski; ex-Sen. Bernie Sanders advisor Analilia Mejia; Chatham Councilman Justin Strickland; Lt. Gov. Tahesha Way; and community activist Anna Lee Williams.
On the GOP side, Randolph Mayor Joe Hathaway is the sole candidate.
Most of the would-be candidates filed far more than the 500 signatures needed to win a spot on the ballot for the special primary. The deadline to file objections to petitions is Friday.
The Democratic winner will face Hathaway on Thursday, April 16.
Sherrill, who becomes governor on Jan. 20, said she won’t be weighing in on which candidate she supports. Gov. Phil Murphy (D) urged voters to cast their ballot for Gill, who managed Murphy’s 2017 gubernatorial campaign. U.S. Sen. Andy Kim (D-NJ) endorsed Malinowski.
The 11th District includes parts of Essex, Morris, and Passaic counties. When Sherrill was first elected to represent it in 2018, she was the first Democrat to win the district in decades. Its boundaries have since been redrawn to make it easier for Democrats to win. It went for Democrat Kamala Harris over Republican Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race by nearly 9 points, and Sherrill won it in last month’s gubernatorial race by about 15 points.

(Getty Images)At a hearing on a Republican bill to improve math education, Wisconsin lawmakers were suddenly faced with a pop quiz.
“Let’s say I went to St. Vinnie’s [thrift store], got a bat, and a ball. Okay, $1.10 for both of them. The bat costs a dollar more than the ball,” said Mitchell Nathan, a math learning sciences professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, at a November public hearing before the Assembly Education Committee. “How much was each item?”
Nathan pushed them for responses. Some lawmakers murmured it would be $1 for the bat. One added that that’s only if there is no tax included. Others didn’t respond. It was Rep. Lindee Brill (R-Sheboygan Falls) who provided the correct answer of $1.05.
Nathan told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview that he wanted lawmakers to think more concretely about math education as they consider ways to improve it.
“[Brill] got it right because she actually did the math,” Nathan told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview. “She actually sat down and carefully thought it through, instead of just reacting and applying quick numeracy… It felt like a good opportunity to just have people experience what they were talking about, so it wasn’t just all abstract. I thought it was important for me as a learning scientist to clarify that what we might know and what we might take away from legislation on the science of reading doesn’t immediately map over to mathematics.”
Lawmakers are seeking to mirror the work that they did on reading education in 2023 under Act 20, which sought to ensure schools focus on teaching the “science of reading.” The new reading law used $50 million in funding to help with costs related to curriculum and literacy coaches and established an Office of Literacy within DPI. 
Lawmakers’ proposal to improve math education is more modest than the literacy efforts.
Coauthored by Rep. Karen Hurd (R-Withee) and Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield), AB 615 would require schools to implement three numeracy-based tests per year for students starting in kindergarten through eighth grade. 
“The goal of this legislation is to identify students who are falling behind in math and to implement corrective measures to ensure these students stay on pace with their peers,” the lawmakers wrote in a cosponsorship memo. 
The bill comes as Wisconsin, like much of the country, has not recovered to pre-pandemic performance levels on math assessments.
Lawmakers expressed concern that Wisconsin students’ performance in math on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a congressionally mandated assessment, has declined. 
In 2019, 45% of Wisconsin fourth grade students scored a proficient level on the NAEP, and in 2024, 42% scored proficient. In 2019, 41% of eighth-grade students were proficient, and in 2024, 37% were considered proficient. 
Wisconsin also has one of the largest achievement gaps in the nation between Black and white students. In 2024, 5% of Black fourth-grade students in Wisconsin scored at or above the proficient level in math on the NAEP as compared to 51% for their white peers.
Under lawmakers’ proposal, screenings would need to be “valid, reliable, research-based, and predictive of future mathematics achievement” and be designed to identify students who are at risk of not meeting grade-level standards. An amendment to the bill would require DPI to maintain a list of recommended numeracy screening assessments on its website. 
Schools would also need to implement personal mathematics plans for each student identified as at-risk on two consecutive tests. The plan would need to include “quality math tutoring.”
Math teachers and education experts and the Department of Public Instruction (DPI), however, have expressed concerns that the bill would not have the intended effect of boosting achievement.
“Numeracy” testing to measure proficiency 
Republican lawmakers and the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL), a conservative nonprofit legal organization which recently published a paper on reforming math education in Wisconsin, are focusing on “numeracy” — just as they focused on “the science of reading,” as a way to boost achievement. 
In lieu of action from lawmakers, WILL has been encouraging local school districts to adopt a model policy that seeks to “foster numeracy across all schools in the District in an effort to increase mathematical proficiency in all students.” The organization has also worked with ExcelinEd, an national education reform nonprofit group founded by Republican Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, on the effort.
In the paper, WILL defines “numeracy” as “the ability to understand and work with numbers, including place value, arithmetic operations, and their real-world relevance.”
“When students are numerate, they are able to use math in everyday life, not just in the classroom,” a WILL memo states.
Eric Kuennen, a mathematics professor at UW-Oshkosh who spends time teaching future math teachers, said WILL is using a good definition of “numeracy.” He said it touches on ensuring students can “comprehend mathematical concepts, operations and relations” and are able to do “procedures flexibly and appropriately” as well as building “logical thought, reflection, explanation, critical thinking and problem solving” skills.
Kuennen said, however, he is concerned about whether everyone has the same interpretation of numeracy and cautioned against making comparisons between “numeracy” and the “science of reading.”
“With a more narrow focus, [numeracy] can be more concerned [with] just knowing about facts — knowing your addition tables… or being able to do a procedure,” Kuennen said. He also said that “mathematical reasoning and reading literacy are very different things, and our math education experts are aware of that.”
“What may work well for reading and literacy is not what is necessarily going to work well for mathematical literacy or numeracy,” he said.
The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction identified a similar concern in opposing the bill. 
“We do not believe the answer to improving math outcomes lies in creating state laws in a construct that is like 2023 Wisconsin Act 20. The body of research around improving math, and existing state actions around math improvement, are not the same as state-led efforts to improve reading,” the agency stated.
The current DPI math standards were adopted in 2021 with the input of teachers and other stakeholders to provide a teaching framework centered on reasoning, procedural fluency and conceptual understanding, according to the agency.
The bill would require elementary and middle school students through the eighth grade to take three additional tests a year including one before day 30 of the school term, one in the middle of the term and one no later than 45 days before the last day of school. Those tests would need to focus on numeracy. 
Kuennen said testing is a “double-edged sword” that is needed to assess learning but can get in the way of learning as students and teachers may feel more pressure to train for performance on tests rather than focus on learning. 
Nathan of UW-Madison said the approach in the bill is worrying to him because a legal emphasis on numeracy could hinder students’ math education. He said there needs to be a balance. 
“I think we would be in terrible error as a state if we said we’re not going to let kids study other more advanced ideas until they achieve some mastery level numeracy,” Nathan said, adding that the state should not act as a “gatekeeper” of other math like trigonometry and calculus.
Nathan, who noted his comments are his personal views based on his research and experience and not the positions of UW-Madison, told the Examiner that numeracy is a “core building block” of math education and that Wisconsin schools are “absolutely” already teaching it.
“We are doing numeracy, and we do a pretty good job with numeracy,” Nathan said. “Why we have not recovered to pre-pandemic levels is not a simple thing to answer, and it’s almost certainly not going to go away or turn around the other direction just because we do more assessing.”
Funding pressures
Several math education experts and teachers expressed gratitude that lawmakers are discussing the issue, but said they are concerned that lawmakers are just giving schools an unfunded mandate that will do little to advance math education. 
Kuennen said he was surprised by the content of the bill. Having read WILL’s paper, he said the organization presented “great information” and “really good recommendations,” but the proposed bill leaves a big gap between the two.
In addition to early screening, WILL has recommended that schools implement more targeted teacher training, flexible coaching models to support math instruction and regular reporting of math achievement.
“There’s nothing in [the bill] about supporting teacher professional development. There’s nothing in there about funding teacher professional development, or funding having math coaches in elementary school,” Kuennen said. “This bill seems like it’s just an unfunded mandate for schools to implement additional testing. The irony is that the motivation for this bill is that our students are testing poorly, so our recommendation is to do more student testing. We already know the problems and we know the solutions, but I think the real issue is the solutions that work costs money.”
Republican lawmakers and supporters of the bill have cited successes in other states as they urge Wisconsin to take action, including by advancing the bill. At least seven states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Virginia and West Virginia, have implemented new laws related to numeracy and math education.
Alabama has seen the most growth in the nation for math scores in recent years. Its growth comes after years of low NAEP results, including a ranking of 52 — at the bottom of U.S. states and territories — in fourth-grade math in 2019. The state passed a law in 2022 that overhauled its math education. In recent years it has jumped up rankings to 32nd, with students nearing national averages. Alabama is the only state whose math scores have reached its pre-pandemic levels.
Wisconsin’s fourth-grade students were above the national average for math proficiency and its eighth-grade students ranked third on the NAEP in 2024.
Nathan said the legislators’ use of the Alabama/Wisconsin comparison was a great example of the need to dive deeper into the math concepts they are considering.
“If you’re really low to start, you have a lot of room to move up, and if you’re scoring quite high, you don’t have a lot of room to move up, so those are important contexts in which to interpret these numbers” Nathan said. He added that “what Alabama is doing — which is seemingly helping Alabama a great deal — is backed by a lot of money.”
Alabama’s Numeracy Act adopted in 2022 was expansive — replacing the state standards, establishing an Office of Mathematics Improvement, providing new instructional materials, implementing professional development for teachers and hiring elementary math coaches as well as monitoring student progress and offering summer school to struggling students. As of 2025, Alabama’s increased its investment in its initiative by $27 million, bringing its overall investment to $95 million.
Unlike the literacy overhaul, the current math proposal from Wisconsin lawmakers doesn’t include any funding.
A Department of Public Instruction fiscal estimate warned the bill would create ongoing fiscal pressures for local school districts and the state agency. 
“Because the bill lacks dedicated funding or reimbursement mechanisms, implementation would rely on existing budgets to be absorbed within existing resources,” the estimate stated. “While the precise financial effect is indeterminate, the bill’s long-range fiscal implications include sustained cost growth, resource diversion and possible equity challenges across districts.”
Local school districts would incur costs related to screening administration, data management, tutoring provision and plan development, and those districts with lower proficiency rates would face added costs for creating math achievement plans.
DPI would have to handle recurring costs to develop, update and maintain the tutoring provider database, public reporting systems, and model achievement plan as well as to provide professional development and technical assistance.
Republican lawmakers and Will Flanders, WILL’s education research director, have acknowledged that the bill would not be as expansive as the literacy law.
“Folks are questioning whether this is sufficient enough intervention,” Flanders said at the public hearing. “There is wisdom in starting with a little bit of a lighter hand because we’re not quite as bad in math as we are in reading.”
However, math education stakeholders are skeptical that implementing more testing will do much for teachers and students.
“If this is the first step, I don’t think it’s the right first step. It’s telling us things we already know,” Kuennen said. “I think a good first step would be to ask the DPI, what’s really needed, and ask the teachers and schools in Wisconsin what’s needed.”
Kuennen said the math education crisis is not new in the U.S. and that the state “shouldn’t panic and do something just to do something” and that Wisconsin has an active community of mathematicians, educators and professional organizations, all who are concerned with math education in the state.
From his perspective, the state needs a “balanced, measured approach that listens to all the experts we have in our state and the needs of the teachers — talk to the teachers, talk to the districts, see what they need and then work to change the priorities, the funding priorities of the state.” Specifically, Kuennen said schools need more time and more money. 
“We need it to be a higher paying job so we can recruit and retain more high-quality teachers. They need time to plan during the school day. They need time to meet with their fellow teachers to collaborate. They need time to meet with students one on one. They need more time to have dedicated to math lessons,” Kuennen said. “The real solutions are more time and more money.” 
Jennifer Lawler, coordinator of secondary mathematics and science for Kenosha Unified School District and president-elect of Wisconsin Mathematics Council, noted in written testimony that 71% of school districts lost state funding in the 2025-26 school year and the requirements in the bill would further stretch budgets and time constraints.
“While some students require additional time and support to achieve at grade level, the provisions for ‘quality math tutoring’ are vague and appear to be an effort to funnel taxpayer money into private, unregulated tutoring companies and/or unproven Al tutoring programs which school districts can ill afford,” Lawler wrote. “The additional testing requirements and the required time for tutoring would also further reduce students’ opportunity to learn science and social studies, as well as engage in fine arts and physical education.”
Nathan said there are many reasons why performance has not rebounded to what it was before the pandemic. One key concern he identified is the turnover of teachers during and after the pandemic. 
“We’ve lost a lot of teachers who had a lot of experience,” Nathan said. “As a state, we have made it less appealing to be a public education teacher than used to be the case. We’ve taken away a lot of rights and benefits and also just publicly come out, blaming teachers for a lot of problems.”
Kuennen said there will not be a “quick fix” to the state’s math education troubles. He pointed to the efforts of Winskill Elementary School, which saw over 80% of students who were advanced or meeting expectations in math in 2025 after bringing in math coaches and taking other steps to help improve math education. Along with local districts that are taking their own step, DPI has said it is working to improve math education in the state.
DPI has said it is working on a statewide plan to provide guidance to school districts on math that will include recommendations for elevating number sense and operation sense, implementing high quality math instructional materials, providing interventions and more learning opportunities, implementing systems to track student progress and building math identities for students and elementary educators. 
“You can’t just do one thing. You can’t just say, ‘OK, what’s missing is this numeracy screening or what’s missing is this particular book or anything,” Kuennen said. “It’s really a cultural shift in how elementary school teaching is structured.”

Gretchen Whitmer last week joined governors from six other states signing onto a petition demanding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency add microplastics to its program collecting data on contaminants not currently covered by the Safe Drinking Water Act.
Led by New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, the petition requests the EPA include microplastics in the next Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule, which would develop a monitoring program for drinking water across the country, potentially leading to further regulation. 
Microplastics are small pieces of plastic between 1 nanometer and 5 millimeters wide. They have been found in every ecosystem on the planet as well as in food, beverages and in human and animal tissue.
While the health impacts of these materials is still being researched, exposure to microplastics is suspected to harm reproductive, digestive and respiratory health and could be linked to colon and lung cancer. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Although the EPA was expected to release a proposed Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule in November with a final rule expected in December, the agency has yet to issue the proposed rule. 
Under a provision of the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA must include a contaminant on the monitoring list if it receives a petition from seven governors, unless it determines that monitoring a substance would block them from monitoring a contaminant presenting more of a public health concern.
Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, Maryland Governor Wes Moore, Delaware Governor Matt Meyer, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, and Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont were the other governors on the petition. 
In a statement, Tami Renkoski, co-founder of the Michigan Microplastics Coalition praised the governors’ decision, emphasizing the need for data to determine the scope of the issue. 
“It takes guts to lead these days, especially on environmental issues but this is a bipartisan issue that will only continue to get worse if we don’t start doing something now,” Renkoski said. “The health of our children, grandchildren and many ecosystems is at stake. Thank you, Governor Whitmer, for having the guts to lead on this issue.”
Wenonah Hauter, the executive director of Food & Water Watch similarly praised the move. The organization filed its own petition with the EPA last year, calling on the agency to monitor microplastics under the Safe Drinking Water Act. 
“This is a momentous step towards gathering critical information we need about the emerging crisis of microplastics in drinking water,” Hauter said. “We thank Governor Murphy for his leadership on this petition and Governor Whitmer and all the governors that have joined him in this vital effort. We now call on the EPA to grant this petition and get to work. People have a right to know about microplastic contamination in their drinking water.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/plastic-pollution-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 06:56:28.622882

Fremont County is an unlikely place for an orchestra, but a dynamic cellist has kept one alive and growing there for 40 years.
The post Maestro Murdock orchestrates classical music culture in central Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","The musicians seated on stage, ranging in age from about 12 to 80, included college students, nurses, retirees, veterans, siblings and outdoor educators. All wore black. 
Holding their violins, French horns, flutes and drumsticks at the ready, they turned their collective gaze to the small woman climbing the perch before them. Rebecca Murdock lifted her delicate baton, and the music began. 
Murdock doesn’t fit the typical conductor mold. She is female, for one, in a position long dominated by men. With her diminutive stature and reserved demeanor, she isn’t what jumps to mind for a task so public and expressive.
As she conducted the orchestra through “Jupiter” from Gustav Holst’s “Planets” series, she kept her movements fairly tight, right hand waving in time, head nodding, eyes finding the musicians to cue, left hand joining in on more emotive moments. A small contained dance. 
The orchestra played. The performance, tight and polished, earned standing ovations. 
The scene could unfold in any number of American cities, but it’s less expected in small-town Wyoming. Fremont Symphony Orchestra, based in Lander, has fielded an orchestra in a town of less than 10,000 people for decades. Today it performs two full orchestral concerts a year and brings world-class soloists to the stage as guests to play alongside the 30-odd resident musicians. 
“I would dare to have anybody find a symphony like this in a town of 8,000,” Murdock said. She’s yet to come across anything similar. “I think it’s kind of one-of-a-kind.”

How does the Fremont Symphony Orchestra do it? It’s got a few things in its favor, the most notable being Murdock at the helm. She has been an integral part of the group for its entire 40-year history, as a cellist, as conductor, as private music instructor and as the behind-the-scenes director — booking rehearsal space, advertising shows, organizing logistics and securing guest artists. 
“Becky’s a force, and she always has been,” said bass player Kate McKeage, who has been playing with Murdock since the ‘80s. “When she has goals in mind, she just figures out a way to achieve them.”
Murdock has a deep store of musical knowledge, a no-nonsense standard of excellence and the energy and organization required to herd dozens of musicians in rural Wyoming into a cohesive symphony orchestra. 
She is uncomfortable with too much credit, however. Musicians, residents, business owners and community groups have supported over the years. 
“I couldn’t have done this without the help of so many people,” she said. 
Music before words 
Murdock was the youngest of seven children born to a musical family. Her mother was a piano teacher, and she would set her baby daughter on the bench during lessons. Murdock absorbed music early and without much effort.
“I honestly don’t remember a time when I didn’t know how to read music,” she said. 
Though she was born in Newcastle, Murdock grew up in Minneapolis. As a child, she chose the cello as her instrument in an act of defiance of her piano-playing forebears. Right away, her school string teacher insisted she have private lessons, Murdock said.  
“My mother said ‘no, I can’t afford private lessons,’” she said. “And he said, ‘OK, I will come over to your house one night a week and teach her.’”
After about a year, that teacher felt Murdock had grown beyond his teaching abilities, she said, so he found a woman in the Minnesota Symphony who could take over tutelage.

“And of course, by then, my parents said, ‘You’re paying for the lessons,’” she said. “So I babysat at 50 cents an hour for 14 hours a week, so I could pay for my $7 weekly lesson.”
Later, she studied music at the University of Wyoming in what was another act of defiance — this time against a father who forbade the music major. In her first semester, she met Michael Murdock; they married a year later. After college, he got a job in Fremont County and they moved to Lander.
Back then, in the early ‘80s, the few avid musicians in the area found one another, Murdock said. Around 1984, she and a small group of string players began playing together regularly. 
“We started a small chamber group,” she said, “and that was kind of the start” of the Fremont Symphony Orchestra. 
“But it certainly wasn’t called an orchestra then.”
Murdock never thought she would be in Lander permanently, and in the mid-’80s she and Michael moved their small children to Washington, where she secured a coveted spot in the Spokane Symphony. But this followed a major mining bust in central Wyoming, which made it difficult to sell their Lander house and sever ties. 
They returned in 1987. By then, the chamber group had turned into a string orchestra. But the UW professor who had been conducting the group was getting older. He asked Murdock to take over. 
She accepted the baton and has directed the group ever since. 
More than wand-waving 
Yes, yes, it looks simple. Stand on an upturned box in front of musicians and wave your arms like a bird. Punctuate the air now and then with the baton. Et voilà — you are a conductor. 
The reality is, of course, worlds away. In her home office, Murdock pulled out sheet music that she conducts to. It’s what’s known as a full score, which means it includes the musical parts for every instrument. It’s dizzying to look at, let alone try to understand. 
But that’s what she does, somehow keeping organized in her head when to cue the horns and when to slow the strings’ tempo and the precise moment when the timpani can crash. 


Murdock learned the basics of conducting in college — it’s a standard part of a music education. When she stepped into the FSO conductor role, the professor who preceded her gave her lessons to hone her skills. 
Starting with a string orchestra, which was only four parts, helped her learn, she said. The music has grown more intricate as the group grew into a full orchestra. 
Conducting is complicated brain work, Murdock said. “You have to really know what you are doing,” she said.
As she practices her cello every day, she also faithfully practices conducting prior to a performance — two hours a day, every day, for eight weeks. Murdock practices by playing YouTube videos of different orchestras and going “over, and over, and over” until she has the work memorized. 
“She definitely knows the music,” said Clara Cox, a viola player from Laramie who played as one of the 19 “imports” (along with her siblings and mom) in the most recent performance. “She knows when people have wrong notes or when they miss an entrance, and she’s good about working on those things. She also takes input, which is really nice. I think some conductors don’t do that so much.”

Cox, who is studying viola and harp performance at the University of Wyoming, said her appreciation for the conductor’s job has grown as she’s learned more about music.  
“You have to know so many different parts,” she said. “There might be 30 different parts, and you have to know all of them, and know the tempo changes, or how a piece starts, or know all the little nuances … It’s a lot of work. It’s very intellectual.”
Dvorak to Disney 
The orchestra grew in fits and starts. Early on, Murdock and cellist Beth Shipley juggled the duties of organizing and performing. They added brass in the ‘90s, Murdock said, and welcomed high school and Central Wyoming College players, and Murdock created a youth orchestra. The group became a nonprofit with a volunteer board in 2010. That helped it leverage grants and donations. 
Making a symphony’s finances work is difficult, she said. Music is expensive and ticket sales don’t cover costs. In the early years, Murdock said, “I begged and borrowed and stole music from people.”
Those later grants and gifts helped it grow. When Shipley passed away in 2017, her family made a $10,000 donation to the group. “That kind of got us off the ground to where we could hire soloists.” 
That includes the likes of renowned pianist Richard Dowling, who strode on stage during the recent Lander performance in a sequined blazer, sat down at a grand piano and dazzled the crowd with solos of Mozart and Addinsell. 
Murdock, who has spent many years traveling to other places as an “import” player, also relies on her large network of musical connections to bring in quality players to help flesh out the group. She makes a special effort to ensure they have nice accommodations, she said, thanks in part to generous lodgers who donate rooms. 
In addition, Murdock is a private instructor, which creates another pool of musicians to draw from.

Fremont Symphony Orchestra still has a “very low budget,” Murdock said, but it has a strong reputation for professionalism in a community that’s supportive of the arts. Where Murdock once had to search high and low for musicians, now she has to turn people away. 
The group has performed everything from difficult Dvorak pieces to the orchestral suite from “The Lion King” with an 80-voice choir. The group’s standards have inched up and up. That includes Murdock’s conducting. 
‘Highly unusual’
Nancy Brumsted first heard of the Fremont Symphony Orchestra when she was a Jackson music teacher. After retiring, she and her husband moved to Lander. She immediately got in touch with Murdock to audition and got in. 
“I couldn’t believe that in a small town like Lander, we had something like this,” said Brumsted, who now sits on the board and plays violin. 
“It’s such a high level of quality,” she said. “It’s really exciting to be able to play with a group of musicians that are so accomplished.”

The existence of the orchestra in rural Wyoming is “highly unusual,” McKeage said. Murdock has built up a funding model, a supportive community and high-caliber musicians, she said. “It wouldn’t have worked in every community, but she made it work in that community, and that’s a real tribute to the community too.”
Murdock said she’s driven by a desire to give musicians the opportunity to push themselves and audiences the opportunity to learn and enjoy classical music.
“She is small, but she is mighty,” Brumsted said. Murdock’s high standards of excellence rub off on the musicians, she said. “She’ll call us on it if we’re not doing it correctly. We have to be on our toes, which I also love, because I want someone that cares that much.”
Lander is better because of Murdock and music, Brumsted said.
“We definitely would not exist without her,” Brumsted said. “She’s really dedicated her life to it, and we’re all richer as a result. It’s such a gift to the community.”

Ranchers and researchers tout futuristic technology's benefit to working lands and wildlife.
The post Virtual fences keep cows in and barbed wire out on Wyoming ranches appeared first on WyoFile .","Dustin Taylor left the gate open when he kicked hundreds of cows into one of his pastures this fall. That particular gate had been a source of endless frustration. It’s in the middle of an elk migration corridor, and each year anywhere from 100 to 1,000 elk pour through, tearing down fences and often becoming tangled in barbed wire in the process.
That all changed this year.  
Over the summer, he adorned 50 cows with shiny black collars and turned on an invisible electric fence that gave the cattle a beep and then a shock if they tried walking through the open gate. Soon after, he placed collars on hundreds more. 
Then he watched as elk flowed through his open gate, and his cows stayed put. 
Taylor, owner of the E Spear Ranch outside of Meeteetse, is one of a growing number of ranchers across Wyoming and the West using virtual fences, a more sophisticated version of invisible electric fences people have been using for years to keep their dogs in their yards. Proponents of the virtual fences say they’re a way to not only lower the number of fences draped across the West but also to give landowners imminently more flexibility in how they move and manage their cattle on a complicated landscape.

For ranchers like Taylor, they’re another useful tool on the same harsh landscape his great, great-grandfather settled in the late 1800s. 
“I like the traditional ways. We’re pretty much a saddle horse operation, and so it kind of makes you think when your cows are all wearing collars that glisten in the sunshine and have an LED light in the nighttime,” Taylor said. “But it’s a win-win with us. We’re not getting elk trapped in fences and cut up in wires and they’re not tearing our fences down. We’re able to better manage our use with wildlife interests.”
A dream comes to life
For decades, researchers and ranchers have dreamed of virtual fences, a way to contain cows that didn’t require spending tens of thousands of dollars building and fixing fences and a way to track cows as they move in real time. But for many of those decades, the technology felt as futuristic as perhaps what a smartphone would have felt like in 1980. 
And while the technology is here, it’s still in its “brick phone stage,” said Drew Bennett, the University of Wyoming’s MacMillan Professor of Practice in Private Lands Stewardship. 
“If you think about where cell phones were in the 1980s, you carried them around in a suitcase or there was the Zack Morris brick phone,” Bennett said, referencing the popular show “Saved by the Bell.” “Then think of where we are with iPhones today. They are the same technology, but in name only, not in functionality. We need to be anticipating where this technology will be in 10 years.”

While technologically advanced, the concept behind virtual fencing is still relatively simple. Unlike an electric fence for a dog around a backyard, which requires burying a line underground that reacts to a dog’s collar, virtual fences operate using solar-powered towers scattered around a rancher’s land. The 20-foot-tall towers act as intermediaries between a cow’s collar, a satellite, and a rancher’s phone or computer. If a rancher wants to, say, change the perimeter of a grazing pasture, he or she needs only to open the computer program and modify the size or area of the fence. 
Cows, for their part, require minimal training, said Taylor. 
The collars first beep at a cow when the animal approaches an electrified fence line. If the cow keeps walking, it receives a small electric shock that pushes it back. 
Cows can push through the fences, but rarely do once they’ve acclimated to the beeps and small shocks. 
Ranchers may actually benefit from cows, when needed, walking through the fence, said Travis Brammer, director of conservation at PERC, the Property and Environment Research Center.
Predators like wolves sometimes use physical barriers like fences to trap and contain prey. If cows, while being pursued as dinner, can simply keep running through the beeps and shocks, they have a much higher likelihood of reaching safety.

As virtual fence companies evolve, they’re creating programs that will then beep on one side of the cow’s head until it turns back toward its assigned pasture, essentially herding it back home.
Ranchers require variable numbers of towers depending on the virtual fence company and, especially, the particular ranch’s topography. A tower in a flat landscape can cover 10 to 20 square miles. Pastures with steep cliffs and bluffs require more. 
Ranchers piloting the collars say it’s been a learning process, and like all new technology, it’s come with its fair share of glitches, including collars falling off, software updates and issues with slow internet.
But many of those are actively being solved, said Brammer. 
Bennett asks ranchers to think less about what the technology can do today and more about where it’s headed because the conservation benefits, he said, feel almost endless. 
Thinking about the future
The biggest, most obvious benefit of collars is the reduced need for actual, physical fences. 
In fact, more than 620,000 miles of fence likely covers the West, enough to stretch to the moon and back. 
And most agree that adding more fence means causing more problems for wildlife, impeding migration, ensnaring legs and preventing access to desirable food. 
The technology, Taylor and Bennett point out, won’t rid the West of all its fence lines. Wyoming is a fence out state, so even if one rancher’s cows have collars and respond to virtual fencing, a neighbor’s cows may not, which means perimeter fences will still be needed. 
However, the bulk of fencing is actually internal fencing, those separating pastures. Virtual fences can get rid of those. Taylor said this year he did not build fences he had planned to construct because of the collars.

As for conservation benefits, Bennett’s team at the University of Wyoming is publishing a paper detailing how virtual fences can allow ranchers to give creeks and rivers a reprieve from cows and prevent fences from being washed out each year during spring floods. They can concentrate cattle in an area to help battle invasive species like cheatgrass, alert a rancher if a cow isn’t moving and needs to receive medical help, and even use grazing cows to target fine fuels in fire-prone areas. 
Virtual fences also open land to grazing that had been off limits because it was too difficult to build fences. It can also be used to replace fences destroyed in wildfires.
The Property and Environment Research Center, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department and local conservation districts are holding workshops across the state to introduce the idea to more ranchers. 
“This is a potential win for natural resources, biodiversity and wildlife, and a win for ranchers,” Bennett said. “When we think about where it’s going, we are limited only in our own creativity.”

Replacing residential property taxes with a higher, more volatile and regressive state sales tax is a terrible idea, opines columnist Kerry Drake. 
The post ‘Tax swap’ bills punish poor, enrich wealthy homeowners appeared first on WyoFile .","Have you ever wondered how a bad bill manages to work its way through the Wyoming Legislature?

Opinion

Here’s an example of a particularly disturbing one that’s only partway through the process: It started when Sen. Bob Ide, R-Casper, proposed eliminating all property taxes last June. That move would have cost Wyoming a whopping $2 billion in tax revenue.
His phony rationale was that the tax breaks the Legislature approved in the last two years — including a 25% reduction on the first $1 million of a home’s fair market value — were too complex. Gee, how could taxpayers determine what exemptions they qualify for, when and how to apply, and which forms are required?
So, to fix a non-problem that he and other far-right legislators created, Ide had a eureka moment: Just abolish all property taxes! He convinced colleagues on the Joint Revenue Committee to have staff draft such a bill.
A constitutional amendment is required to eliminate any state taxes. A resolution must be approved by two-thirds of both the House and Senate, then put on the ballot in the next general election. It would need a simple majority to pass.
But there were many problems with Ide’s proposal, beginning with $2 billion in lost revenue from eliminating residential, commercial, industrial and personal property taxes. How would the state make up the loss of so much money?
Ide proposed raising the state’s sales tax, which would be just about the goofiest thing Wyoming could do.  
“A sales tax is the only way we’re going to muck out all of this layered minutia of property taxes,” Ide said. I’m surprised he could say that with a straight face.
Opponents immediately detailed the folly of this approach. The state’s 4-cent sales tax raises about $950 million yearly. That’s more than a billion dollars short of what all of Wyoming’s property taxes annually raise, so the state sales tax would have to be at least doubled to make up the difference. 


Why would anyone think the average Wyomingite wants to pay 8 cents in sales tax, on top of 1-to-3-cent optional city and county sales taxes for local projects? 
By the committee’s next meeting in August, much had happened to change the state’s tax landscape. Those skyrocketing property tax hikes that prompted the tax breaks had fallen to normal levels in many counties. 
Opponents of the 25% across-the-board tax break had correctly predicted the Legislature’s failure to “backfill” the lost property tax revenues that fund public services like police, fire protection, parks, libraries, roads and other infrastructure would force small cities and counties to make substantial and unpopular budget cuts.
The panel also learned not everyone agreed with the Legislature making more property tax breaks a top priority, much less eliminating the taxes.
Laurie Longtine of Casper was one of about two dozen homeowners who urged lawmakers against further property tax reductions.
“Property tax is how we pay for the things we value,” Longtine said. “It is a responsibility we accept as part of being a caring member of our communities. It is a part of how we take care of each other.” 
Last Wednesday, the committee voted 9-1 to sponsor a watered-down version of the bill that would only eliminate residential property taxes. It voted 8-4 for a “trigger bill” to raise the state sales tax by 2 cents if the amendment is approved by voters. 
It’s still a terrible idea that should die a quick death when the general session starts in February, but it may not. Lawmakers know anything that lowers the tax burden on voters is a great campaign issue, and many will be willing to pass a sales tax increase if they can sell the notion that it’s the best way to equalize taxes for all.
But it’s a laughable claim. A sales tax is a regressive tax, because it requires a greater percentage of income from people with less ability to pay, and a smaller percentage from those with higher incomes. The fact that everyone is paying the same 4-cent tax on goods doesn’t make it “fair.”
Let’s call the Joint Revenue Committee package what it is: reverse-Robin Hood measures that take from the poor and give to the rich. It benefits the rich entrepreneur in Jackson way more than the blue-collar miner in Gillette.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities described the tax changes Wyoming lawmakers are considering — swapping property taxes out for sales taxes — as making state and local taxes “even more rigged in favor of the wealthy.”
The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a progressive think tank, said that on average, the lowest-income 20% of taxpayers face a state and local tax rate nearly 60% higher than the top 1% of households. 
Beth Blackwell, the city of Newcastle’s grant and loan specialist, testified that moving to sales taxes, a more volatile revenue source, will make it difficult for local governments to budget effectively.
“Listening to all of this, it makes my stomach hurt in the sense that you are cutting off the legs of our communities and pulling the blanket out from under them,” Blackwell said.
“Eliminating residential property tax is not reform, it’s destabilization disguised as relief,” said Josephine Carlson, a Wyoming resident. “Property taxes fund the backbone of community safety.”
Another concern is that special districts like hospitals and community colleges are only funded by residential property taxes. The committee’s bills do not address how special districts that have chosen to tax themselves for local projects and build institutions will make up the lost property tax revenue.
Wyoming Department of Revenue Property Tax Division administrator Ken Guille said these special districts may also have incurred debts, based on borrowing assessments drawn from their local property taxes. Who will pay these loans off?
The timing of this major taxation change is concerning in light of the decline in state and federal support for local governments. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities advised states not to pass bills like this any time, but especially when costly private school voucher programs threaten to defund public schools, and federal budget cuts will shift the cost of paying for health care, food assistance, education, and other investments further onto state and local governments.
The good news is that the two bills must survive the legislative process, and this is such a bone-headed move that even the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, which controls the House, may not be able to sell it. But if the Legislature manages to pass both measures, voters will have the final say.
There’s still plenty of time to kill this tax swap, but don’t sit on your hands and waste a chance to let your legislators know it’s a move in the wrong direction. It will hurt low-income people and allow wealthy homeowners to make even more money by not having to pay property taxes.
Legislators, put this dud in your proverbial box of bad bills and don’t ever let it out.

(Getty Images)As a group of Idaho lawmakers looks to improve the state’s child custody laws, at least one legislator believes a group of reforms passed in wake of tragedies in Utah and Pennsylvania may present a template. 
In 2024, the Utah Legislature passed Om’s Law, a bill meant to prioritize child safety in custody proceedings that was named for 16-year-old Om Moses Gandhi, who was killed in a murder-suicide by his father during an unsupervised, court-mandated visit in 2023. 
Murdered boy’s mother speaks in House committee to advocate for Om’s Law

Months before Gandhi’s death, his mother Leah Moses, had gone to Utah lawmakers seeking the legal reforms because of her yearslong custody battle in which she felt the courts did not consider her evidence of Gandhi’s father’s abuse, the Utah News Dispatch reported. 
Utah’s law adopts provisions of a federal Keeping Children Safe From Family Violence Act, known as Kayden’s Law for Kayden Mancuso, a 7-year-old girl shot and killed by her father during a court-mandated visit in Pennsylvania in 2018. 
Idaho Sen. Carl Bjerke, R-Coeur d’Alene, first heard about Kayden’s Law through his work as a member of the legislative Child Custody and Domestic Relations Task Force. 
“It just seemed to fit into exactly what we were trying to get at with this task force, if you’re really looking at the No. 1 goal is to make sure that children don’t suffer through the process of these custody battles,” Bjerke said. “But if we’re going to have any true effect, we have to protect the innocent party.” 
Bjerke mentioned the law at a few of the task force meetings, including one Nov. 11, in which members discussed priorities for legislation recommendations. The task force plans to meet again to approve its recommendations for fellow lawmakers, who will return to the Capitol for the 2026 legislative session on Jan. 12. 
Bjerke said he can’t speak for the rest of the task force, but plans to advocate for something modeled after Kayden’s Law. 
 What is Kayden’s Law?

The federal act, passed by Congress in 2022 to amend the 1994 Violence Against Women’s Act, incentivizes states to make changes such as addressing the definition of abuse and adding past assault convictions not related to the child to what should be considered during custody disputes.
In cases where a parent abused family members, the law requires only supervised visits with children in most cases. The federal law recommends that the court train judges on domestic violence and child abuse, and only accept expert testimony from those who are qualified and credentialed to work with abuse victims. 
The law prohibits reunification treatment, which is therapy meant to repair an estranged parent-child relationship in high-conflict divorces, if there is no evidence it is safe and effective. It also prohibits removing a child from a safe parent to do the therapy if one parent has a history of abuse, and requires that the reunification therapy be administered by professionals if the therapy is going to be mandated.
Colorado in 2023 became the first state to pass the law in its entirety, ProPublica reported. Utah became the second, shortly followed by Pennsylvania. Other states have enacted portions of the law.

 How would the law work in Idaho? 

Bjerke said he learned about the law from attorneys and others who work in family law issues, and he liked that it provides a proven template that’s been approved in other states. 
“We don’t have to be first in everything,” Bjerke said. “We shouldn’t be last in everything.” 
He identified in particular the prohibitions around unsupervised visits if there’s a history of abuse as portions of the law he’d like to see enacted in Idaho. He also liked the additional training requirements. 
He knows that it’s a difficult balance, especially in Idaho that has passed multiple laws focused on elevating parental rights. 
“If someone is determined to have had a history or criminal background that is abusive to a spouse or children … we’re wrestling with those parental rights, but if you really care about making sure that you protect children, you’re probably going to have to have only supervised visitation until something maybe can be proven,” Bjerke said. 
The task force cannot pass legislation, only make recommendations. The committee members are working to bring proposed legislation to its next meeting, scheduled for 10 a.m. on Dec. 10. 
Task force co-chair Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, told the Sun in an email that she and other members are considering Kayden’s Law, among others. 
“Yes, we are looking into everything!” Scott responded to the Sun. “Hoping to have another meeting to discuss more about the legislation ideas.” 
Bjerke’s hope is that kids in these situations might have more limited exposure to abuse.
“I’m not naive enough to know that we catch everything,” Bjerke said. “But if we can lessen the degree that somebody is just going to keep that cycle going because they were so abused through the process, I just think that’s a great way for us to concentrate our efforts.”

Nov. 4, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Supreme Court Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke says his first year leading the judicial system was a “learning curve” of trying to “keep the ship afloat” and move forward.
Funke, in a broad interview with the Nebraska Examiner a few days after his November anniversary as chief justice, said he better understands what the Supreme Court does as the administrative body for the judicial branch. He saw closely what former Chief Justice Mike Heavican did daily for nearly 20 years.
“My job was to kind of keep the ship afloat and keep it moving forward,” Funke said.

Now, a year after succeeding Heavican, Funke said he didn’t fully appreciate everything Heavican did.
“He was a self-driven individual that just really was dedicated to the job,” Funke said of Heavican. “I wouldn’t even say 50 or 60 hours a week. It was 70 or 80 hours a week. He was 24/7 doing something as chief justice, and he did it for 18 years.”
Passing the torch
A first-generation lawyer in his family, Funke said he hoped he was ready to be chief, a step up from his early dreams of one day becoming just a county judge, a milestone he achieved in 2007. He later became a district judge in 2013 and an associate Supreme Court judge in 2016.

Funke said Heavican set a “high bar” for the Supreme Court, and many of its initiatives over Heavican’s tenure came from his ideas and focus. For example, taking Supreme Court oral arguments to high schools, allowing media to bring cameras to trial courts, expanding juvenile probation, creating the Office of Public Guardian and leading statewide summer tours.
“For a long time, I think people just thought it was seven people in the Capitol making these decisions in secret,” Funke said of the Supreme Court. “Really, what we do is we get input from lots of different people, and then we make those informed decisions.”
According to Funke, Heavican, who Funke said often described the courts as the “forgotten branch of government,” saw ways to embrace what the judicial branch did. Funke said Heavican wanted the public to understand the importance of the courts and the impact on their lives.
The judicial branch budget
Funke’s first six months as chief justice coincided with the 2025 legislative session, where state lawmakers and Gov. Jim Pillen, who had promoted Funke in October 2024, had to contend with a structurally imbalanced state budget and a major projected budget deficit.
Funke’s first four to five months in the chief position were about promoting the “good work” of the judicial branch while educating people about the branch’s budget, about $250 million annually and about 1,700 employees.
The core function of the judicial branch is to operate district and county courts in all 93 of Nebraska’s counties, Funke said, plus separate juvenile courts in the three largest counties and the appellate-level Court of Appeals and Supreme Court.

There are also a few dozen problem-solving courts where judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, law enforcement, community members and more work with high-risk, high-need individuals for individualized, alternative outcomes. These intensive programs aim to support individuals and reduce the likelihood of them reoffending, while also seeking to save taxpayers’ money.
Problem-solving courts include veterans treatment courts, adult and juvenile drug courts, reentry courts, mental health courts and family treatment courts.
Funke said the bulk of a judge’s work is ensuring cases are heard in a timely fashion and that they have the resources they need to do so. The court system also seeks to help people feel comfortable with a judge’s processes, how they make their decisions and why.
“Not everybody’s going to agree with it, but at least they may better understand we did listen to the evidence. We heard all sides. We were fair. We were impartial,” Funke said. “And we based our decision on the facts of the case and the law as the Legislature has adopted it.”

There are about 150 judges statewide who annually deal with close to 335,000 cases each year, Funke said. Of those, about 300,000 are in county courts, another 34,000 are in district courts and about 1,000 are considered by the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court.
The judicial system also runs probation, with about 15,000 to 16,000 adults in the system on any given day, Funke said. There are nearly 3,000 more juveniles on probation daily. Probation consists of a “huge” portion of the court system’s budget and employee count.
About 850 adult convicted felons are in problem-solving courts working to try to rehabilitate their lives to have convictions set aside. There are another 1,300 people on post-release supervision and 400 people through the Office of Public Guardian who need someone to help decide housing, medical care or financial decisions because they can’t care for themselves.
The court also assists individuals with behavioral health, drug and alcohol treatment, transitional housing, education, job placement, domestic violence prevention training and more.
“We’re doing a lot of different things in probation to try to avoid people having to go to prison so that we don’t have an incarceration state and we don’t spend even more taxpayer monies on these types of criminal activities,” Funke said.

The court’s budget is relatively small in the total state budget, Funke said — about $5.5 billion from the state’s general fund, primarily from income or sales taxes each year — but “we take that part of it very seriously.”
Attempted budget veto
In May, Pillen tried to veto nearly $12 million from the Supreme Court budget, criticizing the courts for spending more in recent years. However, Funke and other court staff have said those increases have come because lawmakers passed bills to create and fund new initiatives, or told the courts to add programming with existing resources.
Even still, some widely supported legislative programs, such as a nationwide model justice program for all veterans, remain delayed and legislatively unfunded.
Court staff had said the vetoes would close some problem-solving courts and other services. Some lawmakers had begun preparing to defend the programs from Pillen’s judicial vetoes. The cuts to the courts would have been more severe without a last-ditch effort to restore $3 million in one of the final rounds of budget debate.
“Every branch of government must contribute to balancing our state budget,” Pillen said in his May 21 veto message.

The Legislature said the Pillen vetoes weren’t properly submitted according to the Nebraska Constitution, and the governor ultimately backed down after consulting with Speaker of the Legislature John Arch. Had Pillen fought the Legislature, it could have been the Supreme Court deciding a constitutional challenge. Pillen later accepted responsibility for the veto “mistake.”
But budget adjustments are likely back on the menu for 2026, Pillen and Arch have said. Pillen has suggested he might seek to revive the vetoes. All this came before Nebraska’s budget situation worsened, largely from revised economic forecasts. Lawmakers face another nearly $500 million budget hole to fill.
Doing more with less
Funke said the current state budget allowed the courts to continue all programs and services. However, he said the judicial branch, similar to all other areas of government, has an obligation to be a good steward of tax dollars. That includes a “deep dive” into court finances and efficiencies, an endeavor that has been ongoing for the past six months.
“We have to make sure that we continue that high level of output but do it with less money,” Funke said.

This could mean utilizing technology to find efficiencies or having judges travel less between courts in their judicial district, such as more remote hearings. It could also mean more problem-solving work to try to save money elsewhere.
“But at some point, we’ll have to decide: What services do we get the most bang for the buck?” Funke said, adding that “realistically,” some services will need to end in 2026.
In the end, Funke stressed the judicial branch is a separate and equal branch of government.
“They may control the purse strings and how much budgetary monies we get,” Funke said of the executive and legislative branches. “But we are a separate branch, and we have to make the decisions based on what we think is best for the citizens of the state.”
Funke added: “I think we’re doing that, and I’m proud to put us up against other judiciaries across the country.”
‘Real people’
Funke has sought to continue Heavican’s work of openness and transparency for the courts. He was a trial judge when Heavican looked to bring cameras into trial courts, which expanded statewide by 2017. Funke said it has been effective and was an early supporter of the initiative. The courts now livestream public interviews for judicial applicants, too.
Funke also praised the continued work of going to high schools for oral arguments, of which many high schoolers would likely never hear. Supreme Court judges spend 20 to 30 minutes after answering student questions.
This could include federal issues, trust and confidence in the courts or social issues, some of which judges can respond and others they can’t. The Court of Appeals also goes to high schools, and both have taken oral arguments to law colleges, too.

In early November, the Supreme Court hosted oral arguments at Connestoga High School, which Funke said is about 25 miles from where he grew up in Nebraska City. He said it was nice to be in his neighborhood and that students hopefully saw he’s “just like them, just a lot older now.”
“We’re not some abstract figure,” Funke said, adding it helps judges be seen as “real people.”
As a trial judge, Funke said he spent lots of time coaching youth sports, including football and basketball. His wife coached volleyball. Funke was also heavily involved in high school sports, serving as the public address announcer for football for 25 years at the high school his children attended. 
“As much as a judge can be involved in the community, I got involved in the community, and I enjoyed it,” Funke said, adding he was not alone among judges.
He emphasized that the courts are only as effective as the public has trust and confidence in the courts, so he takes it upon himself to advocate for his branch. He said he has not turned down any interviews or speaking opportunities since becoming chief.
Vacancies and public scrutiny
Funke said this is also important as the courts face a decline in applicants for judicial vacancies.
Just two applicants recently applied for the Omaha-based vacancy on the Supreme Court for now-former Justice Lindsey Miller-Lerman, who was appointed to the high court in 1998. Her successor, Justice-designate Derek Vaughn, a district judge, highlighted a similar challenge he hopes the Supreme Court can continue to address when Pillen appointed him last month.
If there are not at least two applicants forwarded to the governor to pick from, the process restarts. That happened recently during the search for replacement judges in Madison and Dawson Counties.
“I think now is an opportunity where we have to really kind of double down and redouble our efforts to make sure that we are doing all that we can do to explain the work of the judicial branch, demystify the process of becoming a judge,” Funke said.
Funke said part of this means uplifting that judges have personal lives, are public servants and are often hand-picked from their communities. For some prospective judges, donning the black robe could mean giving up a more “lucrative” legal practice where they could make more money, Funke said.
Supreme Court justices have a salary of $228,431.18. All other state judges are paid a percentage of that — 95% for Court of Appeals judges; 92.5% for district judges, separate juvenile court judges and Workers’ Compensation Court judges; and 90% for county judges.
Funke said there is also public scrutiny to consider. He said judges decide on the law and the constitution, “not based on what they think the law should be, what their own personal belief is or anything of that nature.”
Being from a small community, Funke said it could be difficult to make decisions where people knew him or his family. But he, like others, must set that aside. In recent years, Funke said scrutiny has intensified, which could be part of the reason for less interest in judicial positions.
Path to chief justice
Funke recalled suggesting to his parents that he wanted to go to law school when he was younger, and “we all had to figure out what that meant and how that would work.” One of his mentors was a neighbor, the county attorney for Otoe County, who later became a judge.
Funke would go on to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for an accounting degree before going straight to the University of Nebraska College of Law in 1991. In his third year of law school, Funke took a position back home as a deputy public defender for the county, a position he held for three years.
The following decade, Funke worked in the Otoe County Attorney’s Office and became a deputy county attorney for eight years. When the county attorney became a judge, county commissioners appointed Funke to the vacancy, and he was elected to the position. 
He also worked in private practice for 13 years after law school.

In 2007, a judicial spot opened on the Sarpy County court bench. Funke was one of a dozen applicants. Then-Gov. Dave Heineman appointed him in the southeast Nebraska district in 2007, which gave Funke experience in rural Otoe County, Cass County and a more metropolitan area of suburban Sarpy County, which he said was a “really good learning experience.”
In 2013, a district court spot for Otoe and Cass Counties opened, which happened to be the former post of Funke’s mentor. Funke applied, and Heineman elevated him.
Funke described the trial courts as “a place where you got your hands really involved in the process,” such as hearing from litigants, seeing witnesses, weighing the credibility of testifiers and evidence and ultimately making decisions.
Come 2016, with the retirement of Supreme Court Justice William Connolly, then-Gov. Pete Ricketts elevated Funke again. Funke thought to himself, “Those spots don’t come open very often.”
“If you want to give yourself a chance to be on the Supreme Court, you got to take them when you can get them,” Funke said.
Of all current members of the Supreme Court, all but one previously served as a trial judge.
‘Pride in the work we do’
The Supreme Court has heightened Funke’s focus not just on the law but on process and procedure, largely because appellate cases are dictated by jurisdiction and whether cases are done “correctly” before reaching the highest state court.
Funke attributed any success in the judicial branch to its public servants, including staff who have stayed for decades, as well as judges who make hard decisions most Nebraskans will never see or be reported on and won’t ever reach the Supreme Court.
“We take pride in the work we do. We understand how important it is to the citizens of the state, and people strive to do the best they can,” Funke said. “We’re fortunate that we have those people working for us.”

(Photo by Edward Saunders, used with permission). America’s current president in his constitutional role as commander-in-chief of America’s armed forces has publicly threatened even unto death those military leaders who conclude his orders are illegal and are not to be followed. Hugh Thompson, a courageous soldier decades ago, had something to say about that.
The sight sickened them. On March 16, 1968, near the South Vietnamese village of My Lai, shown as “Pinkville” on Army maps, Army helicopter pilot warrant officer Hugh C. Thompson, Jr. and his crew, Army specialist Glenn Andreotta and Army specialist Lawrence Colburn, saw from the air something they could not comprehend. But Thompson, an experienced combat pilot, knew something was terribly wrong.
They were flying aerial reconnaissance supporting Task Force Barker, a battalion-size U.S. infantry force from the 23rd U.S. Infantry Division. The task force was on a so-called search-and-destroy mission. However, after weeks of suffering casualties and enduring severe psychological stress from relentless enemy sniper fire and treacherous landmines, something broke inside the exhausted, overwrought, and angered infantrymen of Company C, First Battalion, 11th Infantry Brigade. A deep something, which binds the fundamental core of human existence. A fabric separating human from animal, from modern man to the primitive, and from decency to savagery.
Flying over the battlefield Thompson saw more than a hundred dead bodies in a water-filled ditch — women, infants, children and the elderly. He witnessed American soldiers rampaging and indiscriminately firing into, bayoneting, and sexually violating civilian noncombatants. Thompson, risking much, landed his small helicopter between the civilians and marauding leaderless soldiers. In an act of moral and physical courage Thompson, a man of principle, saved countless Vietnamese civilian lives. He was instrumental in stopping the ruthless massacre. For his actions that day, Thompson would later receive a medal for heroism.
On the ground Thompson confronted Army First Lt. William L. Calley, an inept Company C. platoon leader at My Lai. 
Thompson lashed out, “What’s going on here?” 
Calley replied, “Just following orders.” Calley would later be convicted of murder and sentenced in military courts for his actions at My Lai.
Wars in history have been fought generally for prize or plunder. Wars for liberty and freedom are new concepts in history. U.S. wars in succession through World War II had clearly defined objectives. After World War II, U.S. military objectives seemed clouded, answers not easily found as to the why.
America’s disciplined military proudly wear their uniforms, but they have not forfeited a personal conscience and a moral compass of right and wrong. The individual soldier, sailor, airman, marine, and coast guardsman, the flower of America’s youth, holds and implements military weapons of violence. 
These servicemembers are not mindless followers. They have the right to hear from their leaders as to what the military is doing, and if that is justifiable for America and for humanity. They have the right to know if their leaders have the physical and moral courage to husband their lives for a legitimate cause. A cause supporting who and what we are as Americans and what we stand for: liberty or tyranny; decency versus savagery. 
War is a complex dynamic, sometimes chaotic in a fog of violence. Humans fight wars. Humans who struggle with what they see versus what they feel. Military leaders often struggle to control and make sense of armed combat unfolding before them. (The author fought at the Battle of Khafji during the Persian Gulf War.) Even in war, moral considerations surface. Forces collide, be they forces of weaponry or forces of morality. The Golden Rule versus the bayonet. 
In time nations began debating the conduct of war. Nations agreed that in the human condition some things in war are acceptable, while others are not. Nations signed treaties and laws on how wars are to be fought by military forces. Even war has its limits.
Servicemembers of the United States armed forces swear an oath to defend the U.S. constitution and in effect, applicable U.S. laws. Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice mandates service members obey “lawful orders.” But in the fog of war with fierce combat raging or with ambiguous military or national objectives, what truly constitutes a lawful order?
Obeying military orders can, and many times do, put a servicemember in a vicelike grip: A grip of obedience versus a grip of refusal to do what a servicemember knows is patently wrong. Warrant Officer Thompson at My Lai faced this conundrum and responded with the resolute and fundamental decency of mankind.
At Nuremburg, Germany, immediately after World War II, victorious Allied nations put on trial military officers and officials from Nazi Germany responsible for mass murdering millions of innocent noncombatants and unarmed prisoners of war. Crimes against humanity. These Nazi defendants many times offered a defense that they were “just following orders.” Orders from their leaders the defendants deemed acceptable and lawful, including genocide.
The world disagreed with this defense, the so-called Nuremburg defense. America, indeed the world, said military armed forces must still follow fundamental laws of mankind and of human decency.
America must reaffirm this in its armed forces and have the moral courage to resolutely say no to orders deemed in contravention to the righteousness of liberty, decency, and what America stands for. Even if the orders come from the commander-in-chief.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Tuesday, Nov. 18 started out the way most other days had of late in the relatively brief life of Triangle-area resident Fernando Vazquez. Like so many children of immigrants who, despite being native-born American citizens, find themselves working alongside their parents at difficult, low-paying jobs that most of their fellow Americans are unwilling to take on – office cleaners, farmworkers, construction site helpers – 18-year-old Fernando showed up for work at a Cary construction site.
Unfortunately, it didn’t end in normal fashion.
As NC Newsline’s Brandon Kingdollar reported, while Fernando was walking back to work after buying a drink at a nearby store, he saw a group of masked men wearing dark glasses emerge suddenly from a group of unmarked SUV’s that had pulled up to the job site. Within a few moments, they had cornered Fernando behind a fenced-off HVAC area in which he had been trying to evade their attention.
“Where are you from?” one of the masked men demanded of Fernando as they handcuffed him and tossed him into one of the SUVs alongside another sobbing young worker.
Eventually, the masked men dumped Fernando – who was born in Raleigh and was carrying and displayed his North Carolina Real ID – in a parking lot a half mile or so from where they had grabbed him. They threw his wallet and ID cards out the window of the SUV as they sped off.
“I have no idea why they just dropped me off,” Fernando said later. “I kind of felt like I was being kidnapped.”
The men who carried out this terrifying assault like modern-day Klansmen or KGB thugs were, of course, by all indications, U.S. Border Patrol agents. Federal government employees. Your tax dollars at work.
This is the abysmally low place to which things have sunk in 2025 America during the second term of the nation’s autocrat-in-chief, President Donald Trump.
Across the nation – especially in jurisdictions in which politicians disfavored by Trump and his toadies have been elected to office – employees of the American government are riding into town unannounced and vigilante-like to round up people of varying immigration statuses and terrorize their communities. Almost invariably, the people in question are brown skinned.
And it’s just plain and irredeemably wrong.
Yes, it’s true that millions of people in this country are present without full legal authorization. And yes, it’s also true that a very tiny percentage of the people in this group are criminals who are preying upon others – mostly fellow immigrants.
But it’s also indisputably true that the overwhelming majority of the immigrants whose communities are subject to Trump’s terror tactics are, like the tens of millions of immigrants who preceded them (a group that included Trump’s own family), simple, salt-of-the-earth people looking for a better life.
They’ve come here to escape war, persecution and grinding poverty in their homelands and, quite often, to take on incredibly difficult and dirty jobs under conditions that few if any other Americans would find remotely acceptable.
Is the current immigration system broken? Of course it is. The need for reform that would provide millions of people with a realistic path out of the shadows and into full legal status has been overwhelming for decades. Right now, for most aspiring immigrants who lack wealth or light skin, such a path (or, at least, one that takes anything less than decades and vast sums of money) literally does not exist.
Indeed, the understanding and acceptance of this truth was so widespread as recently as early last year that Congress was on the verge of passing genuine bipartisan immigration reform/border control legislation. North Carolina’s senior Republican senator, Thom Tillis, was leader in the effort.
Tragically, however, that plan didn’t jibe with then-candidate Trump’s two-part scheme to make the demonization of immigrants the centerpiece of his campaign and to deny any kind of policy victory – even ones that were indisputably good for the nation – to the Biden-Harris administration. As a result, the plan was deep-sixed at Trump’s direction.
And so, here we are now, living in an unprecedented moment in the history of the nation that has long held itself out as the leader of the “free world.” It’s a moment in which masked employees of our government – many of them well-meaning individuals cynically misled into believing they are somehow helping to combat a “foreign invasion” – are employing terror tactics long reserved for the world’s totalitarian and authoritarian regimes.
Meanwhile, millions of good and honest people – many of them American citizens like Fernando Vazquez – must now go about their daily lives in constant fear that they too will be snatched off the street and secreted off to some domestic or foreign gulag.
Nearly a quarter century ago, a previous U.S. president undertook a global campaign that he called a “war on terror.” Today, it’s a shocking and sobering fact that the millions of caring and thinking Americans pushing back against Trump’s police state actions – people peacefully witnessing, documenting, protesting and organizing and lending moral support to their immigrant neighbors – now find themselves on the front lines in just such an effort.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4603-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 06:56:28.622882

(Getty Images)Despite compiling $2.2 billion in child support payments from 2020 through 2024, Louisiana was among the lowest ranked states and U.S. territories for such collections, according to an audit released Monday.
The Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s review of the Department of Children and Family Services’ Child Support Enforcement Program determined the agency collected nearly 56% of court-obligated payments last year from noncustodial parents. That rate was an improvement from 52% in 2020, but Louisiana still ranked 52nd out of 54 states and territories for child support collection. 
According to the audit, Louisiana struggles more than most states to collect current child
support because of the state’s high poverty rate and its low median household income. Based on federal estimates from 2019-23, the state’s individual poverty rate was 18.9%, compared with a 12.4% national rate. Its median household income was $60,023, compared with $78,538 nationally.
Louisiana also ranked 47th for collection of past-due child support, according to the auditor’s calculations, with the same reasons contributing to the delinquency. 


Let us know what you think...


 

Child support owed in Louisiana is also higher than other states, in part, because the state had a mandatory minimum child support payment of $100 until 2024, the Department of Children and Family Services explained to auditors. The Louisiana Legislature repealed the minimum, effective Jan. 1, 2024, and all child support orders since then have been based on a noncustodial parent’s ability to pay them. Court-ordered payments before that date have to be adjusted through a formal process, which Children and Family Services said could impact a noncustodial parent’s ability to pay them.
“Research shows that child support agencies struggle to collect payments because noncustodial parents can be difficult to locate, may have no income because they are unemployed, or report that their income is too low to have the ability to pay child support.,” the audit said.
There were 222,050 child support cases in Louisiana last federal fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, 2024. That number is down 14% from the 2020 count and in line with a national trend of decreasing case counts. The state attributes the decrease to reduced participation in federal assistance programs, specifically Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Louisiana law requires certain TANF recipients to make child support payments, but participation in the program decreased 63% nationally from 2010 to 2022 as the result of stricter qualifying standards. 
Children and Family Services has used employment and parental engagement programs to improve child support payment compliance, but federal support no longer exists for them. More than 2,600 noncustodial parents in Louisiana received employment and training services in the fiscal year that ended June 30, and the state collected nearly $334,000 in child support payments from them. The state ended the program at the end of July because the federal Office of Child Support Services did not approve its continuation, according to the audit.  
The audit also noted Louisiana improved its cost effectiveness for collecting child support. For every $1 the Department of Children and Family Services spent on collections, the state collected approximately $4.51 last federal fiscal year. The national average was $4.24.

The review also determined the state intercepted an average of $8.3 million annually in insurance claims from parents who owed child support payments. The audit suggested the Department of Children and Family Services could increase that amount if insurance companies that do business in Louisiana were required to share insurance claims data, which would allow the state to identify parents who owe payments and intercept claims. There are at least 12 states with laws that require insurance companies to share claims data, according to the audit. 
In its response to the legislative auditor, Children and Family Services said it will seek legislation to require insurance companies to check whether a parent owes past-due child support before issuing a settlement payment.
Other suggestions in the audit report for the Department of Children and Family Services include working with the Louisiana Department of Health to ensure all eligible Medicaid cases are referred to the agency for collection purposes. State law requires child support court orders include medical insurance for children. If a child is on Medicaid, the noncustodial parent must contribute an amount not to exceed 3% of their gross income. 
Children and Family Services said it is coordinating with the health department to ensure compliance with the referral requirement and has adjustments in the works.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sensoryexercises-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 06:56:28.622882

(Hayley Harding / Votebeat)This article was originally published by Votebeat, a nonprofit news organization covering local election administration and voting access. Sign up for Votebeat Michigan’s free newsletter here.
Despite being certified last week, the election for mayor of Hamtramck may be far from over.
City Council member Muhith Mahmood, the candidate who lost the Nov. 5 mayoral election by just six votes, is suing both the City of Hamtramck and the Wayne County Board of Canvassers to have more than three dozen uncounted votes included in the final total. The case has the potential to reverse the outcome of the election, a victory by engineer Adam Alharbi.
Due to what election officials have said was human error, 37 absentee ballots in Hamtramck were separated from the others and not counted on election night. When the ballots were discovered — opened, but still in their envelopes — in the city clerk’s office the following day, they were immediately sealed and taken to the county elections department.
But Hamtramck Clerk Rana Faraj later said three non-election officials had walked into the clerk’s sealed office on election night before the ballots were discovered, effectively breaking the chain of custody for those ballots and raising questions about their security. The Wayne County Board of Canvassers ultimately deadlocked on whether to count the ballots, resulting in their exclusion from the official results.
Not counting those ballots is “unconstitutional disenfranchisement,” Mahmood’s attorney, Mark Brewer, wrote in the lawsuit filed last week in the Third Judicial Circuit of Michigan, arguing that either the ballots should be counted or the 37 voters should be allowed to cast new ballots. The lawsuit is also filed on behalf of the 37 voters, whose names have not been made public.
Michigan election law requires absentee ballots to be tabulated, wrote Brewer, a former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party (the Hamtramck mayoral election, however, is nonpartisan). To bolster his other proposed remedy, Brewer cited cases in Hawaii and North Dakota in which judges allowed voters to cast new ballots after their original ballots were challenged. According to Brewer, and Votebeat’s initial review of Michigan case law, it does not appear that Michigan has ever let voters recast ballots after an election.
“The vote margin in the Hamtramck mayor’s election is currently 6, far less than the 37 votes not tabulated,” the lawsuit noted. “Thus, not only are the constitutional rights of those 37 voters affected but those 37 votes could determine the outcome of the mayoral election thereby affecting every resident of Hamtramck.”
The goal, Brewer told Votebeat, is to ensure that all votes are counted — even if that means his client still doesn’t win the election.
“It’s all the principle here,” he said in an interview on Monday. “My client agrees that every vote should be counted, no matter what the ultimate outcome is. We’ll let the chips fall where they may.”
Hamtramck City Attorney Odey Meroueh didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. Wayne County canvassers also did not immediately respond to requests. Nabih Ayad, the attorney for Alharbi, Hamtramck’s mayor-elect, did not respond to Votebeat but told the Detroit Free Press he opposed counting the votes.
In its canvassing meeting the week before Thanksgiving, the Wayne County Board of Canvassers debated extensively on whether to count the 37 ballots in question. Republican members Lisa Capatina and Toni Sellars expressed concern over the broken chain of custody, while Democratic members Richard Pruess and Edward Keelean said they felt that the ballots should be counted and that further investigation was warranted.
Because the ballots had not been included in the unofficial tally, at least three of the four canvassers would have needed to vote to count them in order for them to be included.
The lawsuit asks for immediate consideration, but it is not clear when the case will be heard or resolved. Hamtramck’s new mayor is scheduled to take office Jan. 1.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The seven members of the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled unanimously in all but one of 105 written opinions issued in the past year.
The two years prior, the high court unanimously decided about 95% of its 272 written decisions. Exceptions included dissents in cases dealing with voting rights for felons, whether the state could be held liable in cases of child sexual assault and what constitutes a “single subject” for some legislative bills.

Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke, who joined the Supreme Court in 2016 and was promoted to the top job in November 2024, told the Nebraska Examiner in a broad November interview that justices “try really hard to get to a unanimous vote.”
“The reason we do that is our cases are stare decisis, a precedent for the lower courts and the attorneys, practitioners, to use as guidance. They’re binding authority,” Funke said. “We want to be able to say something as clearly as we can and as unanimously as we can so that trial judges have confidence that that’s what the law is.”
Oral arguments
The Nebraska Supreme Court consists of a chief justice, who represents the state at large, and six associate judges who each represent a different district. The Supreme Court looks at all appellate cases and decides whether to keep or send them to the state’s Court of Appeals, Funke said. 
Supreme Court justices get every seventh case, as assigned by the clerk. Justices then begin working the case up with the assistance of two law clerks on where it might go. Attorneys are scheduled to file briefs on their cases before oral arguments.

(Courtesy of Nebraska Judicial Branch)
At those monthly oral arguments, all justices have an opportunity to ask questions about cases beyond what Funke said is an often “sterile record” devoid of emotion or chances to weigh credibility and see witnesses live. It’s a chance to connect with attorneys who have “lived with the case” for two or three years, if not longer, but who justices have had in front of them for just a couple of months.
“It’s just an opportunity to really have a conversation about the case,” Funke said.
Crafting an opinion
Immediately after oral arguments, the Supreme Court justices head back to a consultation room behind the courtroom. The “author judge,” whose assignment is not announced publicly, leads the discussion and sometimes says how they feel it should be decided, pending feedback.
The lead judge then takes that information back and starts drafting an opinion, which can take a couple of weeks to a month, or even six months. It’s often circulated to other justices for review, with chances for other justices to ask informal questions or suggest changes.

Once the case is ready, it will be put back up for formal consultation — a weekly meeting every Wednesday at 9 a.m. — before a final vote on the case, which is recorded internally.
If a Supreme Court justice disagrees on the legal argument or outcome of a case, they can sometimes work with the author judge on small tweaks that, if made, wouldn’t materially change the majority’s decision on a case but could bring that justice more on board. It might also move a judge to “concur” with the outcome, but for different legal reasons.
Often, Funke said, a dissenting judge has already shared their view and already shared a draft. Justices can also “concur” if they agree with all or part of the majority opinion but do so by a different legal reason or want to bring up other issues they feel should have been addressed. Of the decisions issued in the past three years, about 10% included one or more concurrences.
If the assigned author judge happens to also be the dissenting judge, Funke said he’s seen that resolved in one of two ways.
One, the author judge won’t agree with the majority but understands the issue well enough to write how the majority wants it. The case might then be signed off as “per curiam,” without saying who wrote it, and the justice might still write a separate dissent.
Two, the author judge might ask the chief to reassign the decision. The resulting judge might take some thoughts from the first assigned justice.
Nebraska Supreme Court restores LB 20 and lets people with felony pasts register to vote

One rare case in recent years came in 2024, when a divided Supreme Court agreed to force Secretary of State Bob Evnen and Attorney General Mike Hilgers to comply with a new state law that gave voting rights back to convicted felons immediately after they completed their sentence, rather than two years after. It was decided 5-2 in favor of voting rights groups.
Every justice wrote in that case, plus the majority “per curiam” outcome. One justice concurred with the outcome but dissented with part of the majority opinion.
Supreme Court opinions are released every Friday morning, while the Court of Appeals releases its decisions every Tuesday morning. The day before, the courts announce what cases the courts expect to weigh in on.
A typical day-to-day
Funke said Supreme Court justices spend their days reading cases assigned to them and reviewing records, transcripts and attorney arguments on why a trial court decision was right or wrong. The remaining time, justices write, which Funke said is about 200 opinions each year.
Each Supreme Court member also has specific duties, such as overseeing probation, problem-solving courts, court technology, security or disciplinary complaints.
“Not what I would call super exciting on the cutting edge of activity, but we spend a lot of time in our offices reading and writing and preparing for court,” Funke said.
‘Fortunate and blessed’
Funke served as a trial court judge between 2007 and 2016 before joining the Supreme Court, which he said was a separate “baileywick.”
A “good” trial judge, Funke said — one who people respect and know will listen and hear evidence to make an informed decision — will often spend their days in trial but write decisions on nights and weekends. Trial judges then spend additional time researching and writing more opinions and orders “purely on what the law is,” Funke said.
There are about 150 judges statewide who annually deal with close to 335,000 cases each year, Funke said. Of those, about 300,000 are in county courts, another 34,000 are in district courts and about 1,000 are considered by the Court of Appeals or state Supreme Court.
Many judges spend time in and give back to their local communities, too.
Said Funke: “We are fortunate and blessed to have really good judges that just really remember where they came from and who they’re supposed to be serving.”

Public lands are the living source of family stories and traditions, home for abundant native fish and wildlife, and economic force multipliers for our communities. Public lands mean freedom. 
The Bureau of Land Management manages over 20% of the land mass in Idaho, totaling nearly 12 million acres in Idaho and 245 million acres in the United States. While we all may have differences of opinion on how these lands should best be managed, Idahoans agree that these public lands belong in public hands. 
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, has rightly called our public lands “the heart and soul of Idaho.” Sen. Risch, along with U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo and Congressman Mike Simpson, both R-Idaho, stepped up on behalf of Idahoans this summer and prevented the sale of millions of acres of public lands to developers. 
Trump nominates former NM GOP Congressman Steve Pearce to lead federal public lands agency

So Idahoans might be surprised that the latest nominee to serve as the national BLM director, Steve Pearce, is an ardent supporter of selling off public lands. Steve Pearce is an oil executive and former Congressman from New Mexico (2003-2009 and 2011-2019). In a 2012 letter to then U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, Mr. Pearce made the following recommendation to reduce the deficit: 
“[d]ivesting the federal government of its vast land holdings could pay down the deficit and reduce spending. The federal government owns roughly 650 million acres of land, or ⅓ of the entire landmass of our country. Over 90% of this land is located in the western states and most of it we do not even need.” 
In a 2012 speech at the Colorado Conservative Political Action Conference, then-Congressman Pearce boasted “… we’ll reverse this trend of public ownership of lands.” 
Confirming Steve Pearce would be the equivalent of hiring one of the “smash and grab” jewelry thieves to manage the national treasure of our living public lands. Of course, any good thief should know that the public is now watching so we should also beware of under-the-table handouts for billionaires with proposals to “scale back” current land protections. 
Our BLM lands are already in enough trouble — understaffed, underfunded, and under increased pressure from invasive species, wildfires, and development and other risks. We do not need an auctioneer to hold a fire-sale of our public lands to the highest bidder or transfer them to the states (where they would inevitably be sold off). 
Instead, we need a BLM director who treasures our public lands in the same ways that we do. We need someone who can build relationships, bring people together with collaborative solutions, and work in good faith to restore, protect and steward our public lands for future generations of Idahoans. 
Idaho has an important voice in this decision. Sen. Risch serves on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee which will vet Mr. Pearce. Sen. Risch is well-known for asking tough questions. Idahoans deserve to know if Mr. Pearce still supports the sale of America’s public lands.

Bill Lee has released its first set of recommendations for conservation of the Duck River. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)An advisory group tasked with identifying ways to balance conservation and water needs on a treasured Tennessee river issued its first recommendations to Gov. Bill Lee on Nov. 20, a year after Lee issued an executive order prioritizing the river’s protection.
The 269-mile Duck River is known for its biodiversity, hosting the largest variety of living organisms of any freshwater river in North America. But the scenic river is also under increasing pressure as Middle Tennessee’s population growth ratchets up demand for water and drought conditions lead to low flows. 
The proposed measures include implementing drought preparedness initiatives and regulations, analyzing the feasibility of a pipeline bringing water from the Tennessee River to Middle Tennessee, and raising winter water levels in the Normandy Dam, a reservoir that allows the Tennessee Valley Authority to regulate water flows on the Duck.
Lee created the Duck River Watershed Planning Partnership — a 19-member advisory group made up of state and local officials, utility representatives, and conservation group leaders — to steer the creation of a plan to manage the delicate watershed while continuing to provide water for more than 250,000 people.
The partnership met several times over the last eight months and conducted a community survey that collected responses from 850 people.
The group’s initial recommendations do not come with a total estimated price tag, though some price estimates for individual components were included in an earlier draft of the document. 
Group seeking to build Columbia Dam on Duck River teams with Ogles to pursue federal funds for study

A separate feasibility study completed by the Mallory Valley Utility District in September estimated that a pipeline connecting to the Cumberland River — about 30 miles away from Columbia — could cost around $1.9 billion. This pipeline was not among the advisory group’s recommendations, though the group did state that information gathered during this feasibility study may help inform the study of a potential Tennessee River pipeline.
A proposal to build a dam on the Duck River in Columbia was not included in the recommendations. A group called “Columbia Dam Now” has been advocating for a new dam for months, positioning it as the only solution to keeping water affordable in fast-growing southern Middle Tennessee. The idea has been staunchly opposed by environmental groups that say a dam would have detrimental environmental impacts and question the project’s feasibility and land requirements. 
Columbia Dam Now announced in July that the group was working with U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles to secure congressional funding for a feasibility study for the proposed dam, but that funding has yet to materialize. The Maury County Commission passed a non-binding resolution supporting a feasibility study for the dam proposal in November. In a social media post, Ogles wrote that the resolution “affirms my work to secure a feasibility study for this dam so we can provide water ASAP.”
The Duck River Watershed Planning Partnership’s initial recommendations range from short-term to long-term, covering issues including drought preparedness and response, meeting regional water needs, conserving water and habitats, and public engagement.
Drought
Within two years:

Revise and adopt a Duck River Regional Drought Management Plan including voluntary and mandatory water use restrictions based on drought level, monitoring for river flow and withdrawals, and voluntary conservation commitments. 
Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, TDEC, or the Governor’s Office should establish a water monitoring council composed of members from state water, wildlife and emergency management agencies and the Tennessee Climate Office, which will coordinate with national weather, water and emergency management agencies to respond to drought and flood conditions.
Develop a Duck River Dashboard that tracks current data from the Normandy Dam at TVA, U.S. Geological Survey stream gages, discharge monitoring and utilities (water withdrawals and returns).

Within five years:

TDEC should update its statewide drought management plan rules to require utilities to have water shortage response plans — including water withdrawal and water use reductions — that are activated during periods of drought or low river flow.
TDEC and the Duck River Development Agency should consider installing more gauges to measure flow, groundwater and water quality, potentially in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey to better understand the relationship between groundwater and surface water during low-flow periods.

Within six years or more:

Create off-stream storage ponds near water treatment plants to capture and store water during high-flow periods, providing an alternative supply during droughts.

Regional water needs
Within two years:

TDEC should commission a water needs analysis for the watershed, to be completed by August 30, 2026.
TDEC should commission a regionalization feasibility study of water and wastewater utilities to be completed by August 30, 2026.
TVA should evaluate raising the Normandy Dam winter pool up to 5 feet, retaining more water during winter months to reduce risk of low flows during the summer.
TDEC should provide an analysis of a possible pipeline to the Tennessee River.

Within five years:

Develop financial incentives for regionalization activities based on the findings of the regionalization feasibility study.

Within six years or more:

TVA and TDEC should begin a feasibility study on raising the height of the Normandy Dam’s summer pool up to five feet, informed by the findings of the water needs analysis.

Water and habitat conservation
Within two years:

Establish a water loss reduction program that works with utilities across the state to audit water loss and address issues found during these audits, with incentives for reducing loss.

Within five years:

Provide incentives to private landowners who pursue conservation easements and/or practice sustainable agriculture that protects the river’s habitat and water quality.
Invest in groundwater recharge, green infrastructure and rainwater harvesting projects.
Create a wetland restoration fund to restore and expand wetlands in the Duck River watershed.
Encourage local governments to consider adopting overlays creating permanent development buffer zones on each riverbank.
Develop a watershed-wide growth plan.


Develop a water use efficiency plan to evaluate, promote and track efficiency practices.

Within six years or more:

Promote water-efficient fixtures, smart irrigation, industrial reuse, green infrastructure, and other initiatives to reduce water use and demand. 

Public engagement
Within two years:

Create and promote educational materials about the Duck River and watershed protection for multiple audiences, including recreational users, nonprofits, farmers and utilities.
Create and promote a ready-to-use tool kit linking watershed issues like drought and land use to education and actionable steps.

Mandela Barnes in his launch video for his 2026 gubernatorial campaign. | Photo courtesy Mandela Barnes for Wisconsin campaignFormer Lt. Gov. and Senate candidate Mandela Barnes launched his campaign for governor on Tuesday — pledging to stand up to the Trump administration and work to make Wisconsin more affordable.
The 2026 gubernatorial election is the first open race for governor since 2010 and Barnes joins a crowded field of Democratic hopefuls. Some of those candidates include Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), Milwaukee County Exec. David Crowley and former Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation CEO Missy Hughes.
There are about 10 months until the August primary. 
In his announcement video, Barnes accuses President Donald Trump and the federal government of looking the other way as working people struggle to keep up with costs. He says the state needs to reject the “Washington Way” and get things done the “Wisconsin Way.”
The video kicks off with Barnes highlighting his family ties to unions, grabbing a jacket with the insignia of UAW, Local 1866, which is the Oak Creek chapter of the United Auto Workers union. He says it belongs to his dad who “wore it everywhere because being part of a union wasn’t just a job.” In the video, construction workers walk behind Barnes while he speaks. 
“It meant you looked out for each other. It meant you had each other’s backs,” Barnes continues, adding that union jobs helped people afford a home, support their families and save for retirement. “That’s not the case anymore. Seems like the harder you work, the more Washington looks the other way. Lower taxes for billionaires, higher prices for working people.” 
“Under Trump, the name of the game has been distraction and chaos to avoid accountability,” Barnes says.  “It’s not about the real world. It’s a show. Outrage. Performances. Everybody trying to go viral. Meanwhile, families doing everything right are still falling behind.” 
Barnes also announced Tuesday that he plans to kick off his campaign with a tour across the state, with stops in Madison, Milwaukee and Green Bay this week. He said he plans to meet voters to hear about their concerns about rising costs and to share his vision to improve affordability. According to a press release from his campaign, Barnes as governor would seek to expand BadgerCare — Wisconsin’s Medicaid program — and “close tax loopholes for the ultra-rich so we can cut taxes for middle-class families.” 
“It isn’t about left or right. It’s not about who can yell the loudest,” Barnes says in his ad. “It’s about whether people can afford to live in the state they call home. A state where you can afford your health care, where your kids can learn a skill and stay close to home, where a good day’s work earns a good day’s pay and where families can not only get by, but thrive.”
Barnes will need to overcome concerns about his prior statewide loss to U.S. Senator Ron Johnson as he campaigns to win the Democratic nomination.
In the 2022 Senate race, Barnes won the Democratic nomination after the crowded field thinned and when some high-profile Democrats dropped out in the weeks before the primary date. He lost his general election challenge to Johnson, who had been considered one of the most beatable Republican incumbents in the country for Democrats, by a narrow margin. 
Before launching his campaign, Barnes had already faced pushback to his run for governor due to that 2022 loss.
The New York Times reported in October that some Wisconsin Democrats were uneasy about Barnes running statewide in 2026. A few days later the Milwaukee Courier, the city’s longest-running Black-owned newspaper, published an opinion piece urging Barnes not to run, saying the state couldn’t risk another loss. The Courier noted that Barnes ran 50,000 votes behind Gov. Tony Evers in 2022, with Evers winning a second term that year. Barnes lost the Senate race by a little over 26,000 votes.
“We need a candidate who can unite this state — and win. Mandela Barnes already showed us he can’t,” the Milwaukee Courier oped stated.
Barnes is pushing back on that narrative. In his campaign ad, he says he knows how to “bring people together” and “how to get things done.” 
“I’m running for governor because this jacket wasn’t just something my dad wore. It was a promise,” Barnes says. “We show up. We look out for each other.”
Barnes served in the Wisconsin State Assembly for two terms from 2013 to 2017 before he was elected as the state’s first Black lieutenant governor. He won the lieutenant governor nomination in 2018 in a two-person race, going on to win on the same ticket as Evers.
Since losing the Senate race in 2022, Barnes has served as president of Power to the Polls Wisconsin, a community-based organizing project focused on getting people out to vote. According to his campaign, he led a team that helped knock on over a million doors to engage infrequent voters and improve turnout and get people out to vote for Supreme Court Justice Janet Protasiewicz and Justice Susan Crawford in their successive winning campaigns. 
The primary election is scheduled for Aug. 11, 2026. The Republican field is less crowded with U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, considered the front runner, and Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann the only announced candidates.

Patrick Morrisey  gives updates on the National Guard members in Washington, D.C. during a news conference on Monday, Dec. 1, 2025, in Charleston, West Virginia. (Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)When a breaking news event happens, you should be able to look to your governor for information to inform the public. However, Gov. Patrick Morrisey has fumbled the National Guard tragedy since his first post about it.
My heart breaks for two West Virginia families whose lives have been changed forever because of last week’s shooting in Washington, D.C.
As soon as we heard that members of the National Guard had been shot, we worried they might be from West Virginia, and we soon learned they were from Morrisey’s social media post.
The shooting was around 2:15 p.m. Wednesday. At 3:33 p.m., Morrisey posted on X that one Guard member had died. At 3:42 p.m., he posted that both were dead. At 4:04 p.m., he rescinded that due to “conflicting reports.”
The post saying both members of the Guard died received over 6.7 million views, compared to 2.2 million views for the post taking that back. And while our governor should be a reliable source of information, we began to worry when we realized he was the only person quoted saying that our Guard members had died. 
Unfortunately, Morrisey’s office didn’t respond to emails from us and other West Virginia news outlets trying to get updated information for West Virginia readers. But the governor was busy doing the national TV interview circuit — he did at least six national television news interviews between Wednesday and Sunday and only one with a West Virginia station, MetroNews. Monday was the first press conference he held for the local media. 
This situation has felt more like an excuse for Morrisey to get on national TV than a genuine show of remorse and concern for the victims.
The governor has handled the National Guard situation poorly since he decided to send troops to Washington, D.C.
In August, President Donald Trump manufactured a “public safety emergency” to mobilize the National Guard to “take back” the capital from what he described as violent criminals. 
In 2024, the Department of Justice said D.C. crime had hit a 30-year low. In fact, both Charleston and Huntington, West Virginia, have higher crime rates than Washington, D.C.
Trump and Morrisey — two men who have never served in the military — have sent young men and women to fight their imaginary war.
In fact, just days before the shooting, a federal judge ordered an end to the National Guard deployment in the district, declaring that the use of troops was “unlawful.”
Morrisey should have never sent members of our National Guard to D.C.
But he did. And now family and friends are mourning 20-year-old West Virginia National Guard member U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom of Summersville. 
Morrisey was nearly an hour late to her vigil on Saturday, which evidently held up the entire event. 
But just to be clear — Morrisey doesn’t want anyone to blame him for Beckstrom’s death. 
“She was there because she volunteered to be there, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.” Morrisey said during the vigil.
He also made an angry post on Facebook during the holiday weekend.
“If you are not all in for the WV Guardsmen who defended our nation’s capital city, who did nothing but protect DC from crime, then YOU are the problem.
“Our Guardsmen were brave and have done everything to defend your freedoms and protect the homeland from evildoers — can we at least unite against cold blooded murder or is that too much???
“Let’s stop the insanity and protect our country. #WVStrong”
On Sunday, he again posted on X emphasizing that the 160 National Guard members who are in D.C. volunteered to stay. He might as well just post, “Please stop blaming me!”
Make no mistake — I support our National Guard members, and I appreciate all they do for us. My thoughts are with Beckstrom’s family and with the family of U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, who is still in the hospital.
But they didn’t need to be in D.C.
Along with West Virginia, five other states — Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee and South Carolina — sent more than 2,000 combined troops to the nation’s capital.
Early in August, the Associated Press reported that the troops were mostly doing crowd control at national monuments and protecting landmarks like the National Mall and Union Station. Other outlets reported they picked up trash.
In an interview with CNN, Beckstrom’s former boyfriend said while she believed in the D.C. mission, she said being there was “pointless” because their authority was limited.
“She wanted to make a difference,” said Adam Carr. “She was happy with it, and she just was also like, ‘Why am I here if I can’t do nothing’ where they limited them so much?”
“She got deputized in there, and they gave them no rights to do anything,” Carr said. “She was like ‘people spit towards us, cuss at us, throw things at us, and we can’t do nothing.’ She couldn’t detain nobody. She couldn’t stop them from doing wrong. They told them to call the cops.”
Morrisey didn’t announce that flags would be flown at half staff for Beckstrom until Monday — four days after her death.
West Virginians take care of West Virginians. Guard members sign up to help in real emergencies — like natural disasters and helping distribute food when food assistance was delayed last month. Governor, I hope you don’t send them to wherever Trump makes up his next “emergency.” Let this be a lesson for you.

(Photo provided)This time of year, Louisville nonprofit publishing house Sarabande Books would typically learn how much federal grant money it could rely on for the next publishing cycle. 
This year, that money isn’t coming. 
Kristen Renee Miller, the editor in chief and executive director of the nonprofit, refused to sign a compliance agreement promising to not promote diversity, equity and inclusion and “gender ideology” this year, nor did she have the authors she wants to promote comply with the new rules. Sarabande’s mission is, in part, to “find and promote what’s been underrepresented,” Miller said — the antithesis of those restrictions. 
The Trump administration’s rules governing what the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) supports were successfully challenged in court this year. At the time Miller would have had to agree to them, though, she had no idea what the outcome would be, or how long a legal challenge would take.
“We didn’t feel like we were willing to wait around to see if they would or wouldn’t (suspend the new rules), and in the meantime, sign our name to them,” she said.
For most of its existence the publishing house, founded in 1994, has received $25,000–$50,000 each year in NEA grants. This year, the NEA changed its rules, requiring arts applicants to abide by President Donald Trump’s executive orders restricting DEI initiatives and condemning “gender ideology.” A court ruled in September that the “gender ideology” compliance requirement violated the First Amendment, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.  
Miller interpreted “gender ideology” to mean “publishing and promoting trans, gender fluid and non-binary authors, which is something we absolutely do,” she said.  
Because of its noncompliance, Sarabande is losing an already-promised grant for this year worth around $25,000, Miller said. She has turned to readers and the broader community seeking to raise the lost funds. 
New priorities: 
Previous Sarabande projects that got NEA funding include:

“Leaving Biddle City” by Marianne Chan
“Master” by Simon Shieh
“A Terrifying Brush with Optimism” by Brian Leung and 
“A New Race of Men from Heaven” by Chaitali Sen. 

The projects that would have benefited from the next grant include: 

“Ancient Algorithms”  by Katrine Øgaard Jensen
“The Longest Way to Eat a Melon” by Jacqueline Zong-Li Ross
“Terra” by Kiki Petrosino and
“Held: Essays in Belonging” by Kathryn Nuernberger

A letter rescinding the 2025 grant, which Miller shared with the Lantern, states the NEA terminated the latest grant because it “is updating its grantmaking policy priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation’s rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the president.” 
“The NEA will now prioritize projects that elevate the nation’s HBCUs (historically black colleges and universities) and Hispanic Serving Institutions, celebrate the 250th anniversary of American independence, foster AI competency, empower houses of worship to serve communities, assist with disaster recovery, foster skilled trade jobs, make America healthy again, support the military and veterans, support Tribal communities, make the District of Columbia safe and beautiful, and support the economic development of Asian American communities,” the letter says. “Funding is being allocated in a new direction in furtherance of the administration’s agenda.” 
‘Not a theoretical good’ 
Sarabande took to social media Nov. 17 with a defiant message, saying it was “exceedingly proud to be misaligned with this administration’s vision for the arts” and asking people to donate cash to make up the difference. 
Miller crafted this message from her own reaction to the NEA rules, she said, but also felt it was a “unifying message” for others with similar reactions. 
“The power of demoralization is a huge project of this administration. It’s overwhelming us with demoralization, with the fear of things we’ve relied on being taken away, the sort of insistence that things we thought about our culture, about our society weren’t fragile, making them look fragile,” Miller said. “It seems to be just sort of a relentless assault on our resilience, on our sense of hope. And … I do take that very personally.”  
Motivated by the idea that the arts tell the story of a society’s values, books should represent all people, Miller said. 
“What I do at Sarabande is not a theoretical good,” Miller said. “I believe that it is a crucial element of our culture.” 
She’s counting on others agreeing with her. Nonprofits often juggle uncertainty, she said, and while cutting books already in production is “not an option,” the publishing house will look at ways to cut costs while simultaneously fundraising. 
“We refuse to be aligned, and we will be very loud about how misaligned we are with” the administration’s priorities, Miller said. “We’re not alone, and we know the community that agrees with us is bigger than those who are trying to push us out.”

The coal unit, Colorado’s largest, with 750 megawatts of generating capacity, had begun producing electricity a few weeks before.
“The beast has risen,” said a sign along my tour.
It had been a difficult birth. Problems had delayed completion by a year. Troubles continued. The unit was down an average of 91.5 days per year during its first 10-plus years. That included 374 days beginning in 2020 and extending into 2021.
In August, 2025, the unit went down again. Xcel Energy, its operator and primary owner, expects the outage to last into June 2026.

Environmental organizations question whether Xcel — and hence its 1.6 million electrical customers in Colorado — should bring back this problematic coal unit. They suggest that letting this coal plant remain silent will be the most effective use of ratepayer money. It is scheduled to retire at the end of 2030.
To ensure the lights — and especially the air conditioners next summer — stay on, Xcel and the administration of Gov. Jared Polis want to delay the retirement of Comanche 2, a neighboring coal-burning unit, for a year beyond its scheduled retirement in December. The retirement has been planned since 2018. The unit is older and smaller. It began producing electricity in 1975 with a maximum capacity of 335 megawatts, less than half that of the newer unit. It has, however, been far more reliable.
The Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, and others do not challenge the plan. They worry, however, about the emissions if both coal units are operating a year from now. They advocate limits on combined operations. “This allows the same total amount of generation from the two units as if Comanche 3 were available for all of 2026,” they said in a filing with the PUC.
Given Comanche 3’s problems, should it even be brought back to life?
“Ratepayers continue to bear the consequences of (Xcel subsidiary) Public Service’s failings when it comes to Comanche 3,” said the city of Boulder in its PUC filing. “At some point, the bleeding must stop.”
That bleeding has been costly. A 2021 report by the PUC staff found Comanche 3, instead of delivering electricity at a cost of $45.70 per megawatt-hour, as had been projected, had cost $66.25 during its first decade.
Some see parallels to the St. Vrain nuclear plant. That nuclear plant along the South Platte River near Greeley operated from 1976 to 1989. Like Comanche 3, it had problem after problem. Finally, operations ceased. The bleeding continued long after. Customers of the utility that is now Xcel paid $2 a month from 1993 until 2005 to cover the $125 million cost of decommissioning St. Vrain. The utility then spent $250 million to retrofit it into a natural gas plant.
Why has Comanche been such a lemon? Xcel frowns on that word but the evidence is clear. A former PUC commissioner has suggested that ramping operations up and down instead of chugging along steadily were to blame. What then explains the problems during the first decade?
The 2021 PUC staff report said “poor maintenance practices likely contributed” to the 2020 outage of Comanche 3. The report also pointed to insufficient communication protocols, lack of thoroughness in procedures, and other problems. A jury awarded CORE Electrical Cooperative, the Sedalia-based cooperative that owns 8% of the unit, $26 million because of the year-long outage.
The question before PUC commissioners now is whether the unit needs to be kept online until 2030. After a decade of very slow growth, Xcel now predicts a fast-paced increase in demand for electricity. It has sounded the alarm about “resource adequacy.”
We’re using more electricity for cars and to replace natural gas from buildings. Data centers are the elephant in this story of rising demand. They use electricity, although how much is debatable. Data center developers want more financial incentives from Colorado, while wary environmental groups want guardrails. This will be a key legislative item in January.
Craig provides another element of the evolving coal-burning story in Colorado. Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association has been planning for almost a decade to close one of its three coal-burning units there this December. Tri-State now expects to get orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to keep the coal unit operating into 2026.
A few years ago, Colorado was triumphantly easing out of coal generation in orderly fashion. The narrative has shifted, this energy transition — what I call the big pivot — has gotten more complex.

James Thomas, the nationally noted preservationist whose lifetime of work at Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill transformed a fading Kentucky historic site into one of the nation’s most admired restoration projects, died Nov. 24 at his home in Mercer County. He was 86.
He is survived by his wife, Susanna, and their two sons, Ian and Mason.
Thomas devoted more than four decades to Pleasant Hill, a former Shaker settlement overlooking the Kentucky River. When he entered the project in the 1960s, the property’s 34 surviving buildings were in various stages of decline, and the Shakers — a celibate Christian sect known for its communal living, pacifism and austere craftsmanship — had not yet entered the broad public consciousness.
The initiative to restore the Shaker Village was initiated by a group of civic-minded Lexingtonians in 1961, led by Earl D. Wallace and Joseph Graves. By 1964, the year Thomas was hired, the Friends of Pleasant Hill had organized a nonprofit and raised funds for operating expenses. They secured a $2 million loan to purchase and restore the site. Later, Wallace was able to have the loan forgiven.
The revival of interest in Kentucky’s Shaker heritage was advanced by Louisville civic leaders, including The Courier-Journal editor and publisher Barry Bingham Sr., his wife, Mary, as well as editorial writer and arts patron Adele Brandeis, whose advocacy for American folk traditions helped bring renewed attention to Pleasant Hill. Their support, as well as that of many others, helped create the cultural conditions in which Thomas’ work would flourish.
By the time Thomas retired in 2004, Pleasant Hill had become a nationally recognized model of historic interpretation, architectural restoration and landscape stewardship. Scholars frequently cited the project as one of the most complete and faithful reconstructions of any Shaker site in the United States.
“Those of us who cherish Shakertown hold Jim Thomas in high esteem for coming to Mercer County to work with Jim Cogar,” observed Lois Mateus, retired Brown-Forman executive and a member of the Shakertown board. Her farm is near Harrodsburg.

In 1964, James L. Cogar — the former Colonial Williamsburg curator who led the early restoration at Pleasant Hill — hired Thomas, then 23, as a staff member. He soon became indispensable to the project. He helped develop the Village’s preservation ethic, shaped interpretive programs, supervised building restorations and created a furniture reproduction initiative that ultimately produced nearly 2,000 pieces based on original Shaker designs.
“Tutored by Mr. Cogar, Jim made it his life’s work to carry on Shaker traditions and perfection with a love of history and a fine aesthetic eye to the highest standards of preservation,” Mateus remembered. “He loved the buildings. He loved the craft. He loved the land.”
James Cheston Thomas was born in Philadelphia in 1939 and moved to Louisville at age 15. He attended Louisville Country Day School and later the University of Louisville. His early training in historic preservation began at Locust Grove, the home of George Rogers Clark, where he worked with the restoration architect Walter Macomber, known for his work on Colonial Williamsburg.
For many Kentuckians, their first entry into the world of Jim Thomas came in a May 5, 1963, article in The Courier-Journal by Marion Porter, at that time one of the newspaper’s top feature writers. Jim was pictured with his brother, Sam, outside the log cabin where they lived at Locust Grove, the early Kentucky residence being restored on Blankenbaker Lane. With them was Clark, their German shepherd named for George Rogers Clark, who helped the brothers protect the property. (Samuel Thomas died in October 2012.)
Locust Grove was far more than a source of income and a shelter for a pair of college post-graduates. Sam went on to become among the most prolific and influential historians of Louisville and its historic neighborhoods. And Jim gained the attention of those who were instrumental in Shakertown’s preservation.
The team that brought Shakertown’s restoration to fruition gathers behind one of the village’s distinctive fences.

Jim Thomas was named curator in 1968 and steadily advanced through the organization: vice president in 1971, executive vice president in 1974, and president and chief administrative officer in 1975 upon Cogar’s retirement. In 1990, he was appointed chief executive officer, assuming responsibility for restoration, interpretation, education programs, lodging, dining services, craft operations and long-range planning.
Thomas also wrote extensively about Kentucky history and architecture. With his brother, he wrote “The Simple Spirit,” a pictorial study of Pleasant Hill. He was co-author with Stephen Beal of “Old Mud Meeting House,” the definitive account of the oldest Low Dutch Reformed church west of the Alleghenies. His consulting work made him a widely recognized authority on Kentucky log buildings and early frontier construction.
“Pleasant Hill is not solely inhabited by the ‘simple spirit’ of the Shakers who built and lived in the community,” observed Billy Rankin, president and CEO of the nonprofit. “It also graced the presence of those who saved what remained after the Shakers and shared it with the world. Chief among these presences is Jim Thomas.”
His leadership at Pleasant Hill earned numerous honors, including the National Trust for Historic Preservation’s Trustee Emeritus Award for Excellence in 2001. Thomas himself received the Kentucky Heritage Council’s Ida Lee Willis Memorial Award in 1998, the Blue Grass Trust’s John Wesley Hunt Award in 1999 and the James Harrod Trust’s Jane Bird Hutton Award in 2003. In 2025, he was named president emeritus of Shaker Village at Pleasant Hill.
His influence extended across the commonwealth. As interest in the Shakers grew, Thomas became a central figure in helping Kentucky articulate a broader vision of cultural preservation, one rooted in accuracy, landscape stewardship and respect for vernacular craftsmanship.
One of Jim Thomas’s first responsibilities was to train local carpenters to make reproduction furniture to populate the buildings. Much of this furniture is still being used today throughout the site. (Photo courtesy of Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill)
Thomas and his family lived for many years at Barter Farm, a 185-acre property near Pleasant Hill. In 1967, he reconstructed a circa 1800 double-pen log house there using traditional methods and materials. His wife, Susanna, continues to live in the home. Susanna Massie Thomas, a noted horsewoman, long has advocated, as she describes on their website, for protection and preservation of farmland and scenic byways, the value of local economies and the importance of organic home cooking. The Thomas partnership made them true Kentucky treasures.
He was a devoted parishioner of St. Philip’s Episcopal Church in Harrodsburg.
Today, Pleasant Hill stands as one of the most complete Shaker restorations in the country, drawing visitors from around the world. Many of the site’s architectural details — from the sweep of its stone fences to the cadence of its restored staircases — bear the imprint of Thomas’s scholarship and discipline.
“Jim combined a love for our state’s heritage with the expertise and willpower to carry out the work of preserving it,” concludes Billy Rankin. “This was no easy task, and generations of Kentuckians are forever in his debt for the good work he has done. We do this noble work still today, with the knowledge that we are standing on his broad shoulders.” 
The person who knew him best, Susanna, offered this appraisal of his character, which encapsulates Jim Thomas simply and eloquently: He was “exacting, honest, hard-working, self-taught, keenly attentive to detail, gracious, authentic, humble, respected, and loved. Invariably, when his name is mentioned, people who knew him will say, ‘Jim Thomas was a good man.’”

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)In an effort to protect healthy soils and boost vitality, the American Farmland Trust has opened up applications for farmers and ranchers in Virginia and across the nation to apply for grants that encourage regenerative agriculture practices.
The two grants are part of a national push to help farmers finance measures to mitigate climate impacts and build more resilient land. The main goal of the American Farmland Trust, which is managing the grants, is to protect farmland from erosion through climate change and farming methods that deplete the land. 
“Regenerate Virginia brings together the tools farmers need to build healthier soils, strengthen their operations, and secure the future of agriculture in the Commonwealth,” said Amanda Cather, AFT’s Mid-Atlantic Deputy Director. The organization was started in 2020 to help farmers on the national scale.
The healthy soils grant offers up to $30,000 to help farmers partake in four key soil health measures: planting cover crops to reduce soil erosion; minimizing the use of harmful chemicals or over working the soil; maximizing living roots; and diversifying crop species while integrating livestock to naturally fertilize the soil.
The farm vitality grant allows up to $25,000 per producer for product and market expansion, business development, and to apply for equipment that can aid in regenerative practices. This will help farmers and ranchers make business decisions to adopt regenerative practices and get equipment to start right away on new methods to help their soil.
Equipment that could qualify for the grant include no-till seed drills, solar-powered irrigation pumps, roller-crimpers, and several other options.
The funding stems from the Brighter Future Fund, a part of the American Farmland Trust that focuses on conservation of agricultural land and promoting farming practices that help keep the land viable. In July, 38 Virginia farmers and ranchers were awarded $896,600 between the two grants.
Regenerative farming methods are believed to be a major driver in reducing carbon emissions. There is also a growing concern among communities about valuable agricultural land being dismantled in favor of development. Grants such as this aim to help farmers follow regenerative principles that will help them save money in the long run and keep their soil usable for future generations.
Applications are now open until Dec. 19.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis received some difficult but not entirely unsurprising news over the Thanksgiving holiday: her sweeping election subversion case against President Donald Trump and several allies was officially dismissed, ending one of the most bizarre legal chapters in Georgia history.

Willis, an elected Democrat, quickly emerged as one of the president’s most prominent political foes after the 2020 election, when her office launched an investigation into Trump’s attempts to stay in power following his narrow defeat. The investigation stemmed from a January 2021 phone call between Trump and state election officials, where he was heard urging them to “find” enough votes that would erase his deficit.

Her office would spend the months and years that followed interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence. The Fulton County Courthouse was surrounded by orange barricades and armed guards as threats to Willis increased. She unveiled the sweeping 41-count indictment in August 2023, accusing Trump and 18 allies of participating in a criminal enterprise. An angry Trump would travel to the Fulton County Jail to have his booking photo taken, becoming the first American president to appear in a mugshot.

At the time, the case seemed like it would be the strongest chance to hold the then-former president accountable in a court of law, particularly for his actions leading up to the events of Jan. 6: the central piece of evidence was caught on tape, and state prosecutions are outside the realm of presidential pardons. It also made Willis, a veteran prosecutor who spent years working in the district attorney’s office she now leads, something of a rising star in the Democratic Party as she took on an ex-commander-in-chief.
But the case was stopped in its tracks last January after defense attorneys filed a bombshell motion accusing Willis of being romantically involved with Nathan Wade, the prosecutor she hired to help lead the investigation. A native of nearby Cobb County, Wade spent years handling low-level criminal cases both as an attorney and a judge. But he had never taken on such a high profile case prior to being tapped by Willis to take on Trump and his allies.
Indeed, Willis did confirm that she and Wade had begun a relationship. But a financial connection was also established during Wade’s divorce proceedings: credit card statements found that Wade had been paying for airline tickets and other items for himself and Willis using his county-funded salary. Defense attorneys argued she was improperly reaping financial benefits from the case.
After months of hearings and motions, a top court would bar Willis and her office from prosecuting the case. Peter Skandalakis, the head of a nonpartisan prosecuting attorneys commission, assigned himself to oversee the prosecution. He quickly pulled the plug on the case, outlining the impracticalities of having a sitting president as a criminal defendant.
He also questioned whether Trump’s January 2021 phone call amounted to illegal activity: “While the call is concerning, reasonable minds could differ as to how to interpret the call,” he said. “When multiple interpretations are equally plausible, the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt and should not be presumed to have acted criminally.”

Even before her ultimate removal, bad judgement calls from Willis were already derailing parts of her investigation. One of the key witnesses was Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, a Trump ally who participated in the so-called “fake elector” scheme as a state senator. But after hosting a fundraiser for Jones’ political opponent, a ruling from a judge would prevent Willis from bringing any charges against the Republican due to a conflict of interest.
Jones’ case also ended up in Skandalakis’ hands. His decision to dismiss the matter without bringing charges would foreshadow the ultimate demise of what had earlier seemed like the biggest legal threat to the president.
Willis has offered no public regrets about taking on the case. But the toll of a years-long, high-stakes prosecution that ultimately yielded no convictions — financial, professional, and personal — remains unclear. Only now, as the dust settles, is the full cost of her choice to take on Trump beginning to come into view.
Republican lawmakers at the Gold Dome, just a 10-minute walk from the courthouse, had blasted the case from the start and pushed for a series of measures targeting Willis and other so-called “rogue prosecutors.” One of those measures could leave Fulton County taxpayers on the hook for the defendants’ legal costs.
But the scrutiny now extends far beyond Atlanta. In Washington, congressional Republicans — and reportedly, Trump’s Justice Department — are probing Willis and many of the president’s courtroom and campaign adversaries.
So while she is showing no remorse for bringing the indictments, Willis and certainly many others have to be asking: was it all worth it? Trump is back in the White House with his aforementioned mugshot now hanging outside the Oval Office. Willis’ reputation as a skilled prosecutor has undoubtedly taken a hit, and taxpayers must now foot the bill for a prosecution that never made it before a jury.
History will look back on Willis as the first and only local prosecutor to square off with Trump over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. But her lapses in judgment and the case’s ultimate dismissal threaten to cast a shadow over her efforts to hold him accountable when it seemed like no one else would.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC0105_2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 05:57:41.380059

(Getty Images.)Businesses in Ohio and surrounding states are seeing rising prices and declining activity in several sectors, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland reported late last month. Some of that is attributable to massive import taxes imposed by President Donald Trump, the businesses said.
One of 12 regional federal banks, the Cleveland Fed covers all of Ohio as well as parts of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Kentucky. 
It conducts two regular surveys of businesses and community leaders for use by the Federal Open Market Committee as it sets policies influencing interest rates and other matters.
The Cleveland Fed surveys published most recently indicate that Trump’s tariffs continue to be a drag on the economy.
 According to the Atlantic Council’s tariff tracker, Trump has imposed import taxes ranging from 10% to 60% on just about every country in the world — with the notable exception of Russia.
The Cleveland Fed’s Survey of Regional Conditions and Expectations found a big jump in the percentage of businesses that expect to cut staff in the coming year.
“The share of respondents who expected their firms to decrease employment levels in the next 12 months more than doubled between November 2024 (7%) and November 2025 (18%),” it said of the survey, which was conducted in late October and early November. 
However, the report pointed out, less than a fifth of businesses expect to cut staff while 51% expect to maintain it at current levels, and 32% expect to add employees.
The Cleveland Fed produces a second report — the Beige Book — based on interviews, questionnaires and other inputs. 
The most recent addition indicates that the Trump import taxes are helping to drive inflation.
“Overall, nonlabor input costs increased at a robust pace in recent weeks, continuing the trend seen over the past four reporting periods,” it said. 
“Manufacturers reported tariff-related cost increases for equipment and materials, and one observed that most manufacturers had run out of lower-cost pre-tariff inventory. One large retailer’s average costs had increased around 20 percent year-over-year because of tariffs, and it was trying to determine how it would distribute these increases.” 
Tariffs weren’t the sole driver of inflation, the report said.

“By contrast, another large retailer did not anticipate further cost increases, stating that tariff impacts had stabilized,” it said. 
“Outside of tariffs, many contacts continued to report rising utilities and insurance costs. In general, nonlabor costs were expected to grow at a strong pace in the coming months.”
The Beige Book added that demand for manufactured goods was down slightly, but that it was being propped up by the rapid development of data centers.
“Although multiple contacts continued to report strong demand related to rapidly expanding AI data center construction, some described a ‘collective holding of breath’ as these fast-paced buildouts became a primary driver of demand even as other industry segments remained weak,” it said. 
“Multiple contacts added that demand from data centers was not enough to offset softer activity in other industries. Still, manufacturers generally expected demand to increase slightly in the coming months.”
As the wealthiest Americans grow ever richer — and see their taxes cut — their low and middle-income neighbors are seeing skyrocketing health, grocery and utility costs without commensurate increases in pay. It’s a phenomenon that some economists are calling the K-shaped economy.
Retailers who gave input for the Beige Book reported seeing aspects of it in their stores.
“Consumer spending was flat in recent weeks, and contacts expected demand to decline modestly in the coming months,” the report said. 
“Among retailers reporting flat sales, one noted continued pressure on lower-income consumers and early signs of strain on middle-income consumers, while a higher-end grocery store observed price-conscious behavior among customers.”
Adding to the pain was Trump’s decision to — unlike previous administrations — disrupt federal food benefits during the partial government shutdown. 
The move created record demand and many Ohio food pantries, while the shutdown itself meant that federal workers went weeks without a paycheck.
“Several contacts connected changes in consumer spending to federal policies,” the Beige Book said. 
“A grocery store reported a decline in sales, citing the pause in (federal food subsidies) alongside a general pullback in spending due to economic concerns. A food and hospitality contact reported that customers, many of whom are federal workers, were spending cautiously.”

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)Angela Graves has lived in Merrimack almost all her life. She grew up aware of the Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics plant on the edge of town, and as a teenager learned alongside her community of the dangerous “forever chemicals” it emitted for years. Now, eager to see those pollutants scrubbed from her hometown’s soil and frustrated by a lack of progress, Graves herself has proposed an experimental solution: fungi.
“They haven’t made a remediation plan,” said the recent Plymouth State University graduate who now works as a field organizer with the League of Conservation Voters, though she is pursuing her remediation work independently. “So I was like, all right, I’m tired of waiting. I’m just going to make my own.”
Graves has secured preliminary support from the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services for an experimental trial in mycoremediation, or the use of fungi to clean up pollutants from a contaminated area. 
The use of mushrooms and other organisms to help absorb and break down pollution is a relatively new area of study. The pilot will focus on one type of forever chemical, perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, and it’s not yet clear how much contamination could be removed through this method.
Graves, however, views the study as a crucial step toward finding out. She hopes the work will ultimately demonstrate a more affordable and natural way to lighten the load of contaminants burdening her community.

A daunting problem
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, are called forever chemicals because of their resistance to breaking down, giving them lifespans that can exceed thousands of years. This becomes a problem when, as in the greater Merrimack area, the chemicals — which are linked to health concerns from low birth weight to certain cancers — are released into the environment, where they accumulate in soils, leach into drinking water, and find their way into plants and animals. 
An area of significant PFAS contamination surrounds the former Saint-Gobain site and adjacent communities. The Department of Environmental Services attributes it to pollution from the former factory’s smokestack that settled onto a broad swath of land that stretches into multiple towns. 
Though the department considers Saint-Gobain liable for necessary remediation in the area, no plan for how that will occur yet exists. The sheer amount of affected land in the region poses a unique challenge, Waste Management Division Director Michael Wimsatt said earlier this year.
Typical means of PFAS remediation call for removal of the affected soil, which can then be treated through high-temperature incineration or placed in a hazardous waste landfill, but that hasn’t seemed feasible in as large an area as the Merrimack region, he said in September.
A natural remedy
Graves hopes more feasible means of managing large-scale forever chemical pollution may still be uncovered. The idea of mycoremediation first hit her during an ecology course at Plymouth State.
The technique harnesses the abilities of some fungi to break certain strong molecular bonds, including some of the uniquely strong bonds that give forever chemicals their namesake staying power.
Laboratory studies suggest a group of fungi called white rot fungi, which includes species like these oyster mushrooms, can help break down certain forever chemicals.

In laboratory studies, scientists have shown that fungi can help digest forever chemicals through two main routes: by releasing enzymes into the soil around them that help break down the chemicals, and by absorbing the contaminants into their own tissues to digest them.
One class of fungus capable of breaking some PFAS bonds is commonly called white rot. Graves has proposed establishing a 10-square-foot study plot on or near the former location of the Saint-Gobain plant and propagating the fungi, which are found naturally in North America, on the soil within. 
Taking PFOA — one of the forever chemicals known to be present at the site — as their focus, her research team plans to measure soil contamination within the plot before and after the fungi are cultivated. When the mushrooms have matured and formed above-ground fruiting bodies, the team will harvest them, measure the amount of contaminant they have absorbed, and then send them to an incinerator hot enough to destroy PFAS.
Comparing the levels of PFOA in the soil before and after the fungi are cultivated, and measuring the amount of contaminants the mushrooms themselves take up, will reveal whether the experiment is successful, Graves said.
She added that the method was appealing because it is both relatively inexpensive compared to other means of remediation and more natural.
“I don’t think Merrimack needs more chemicals on the land,” she said.
A step, not a cure
Paula Mouser, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of New Hampshire, said mycoremediation and other types of biological remediation are, broadly, an under-explored area. 
Mouser declined to comment on the specific project proposed for Merrimack, saying she was unfamiliar with the details. But speaking generally, she said a major challenge with measuring the success of biological remediation projects is the difficulty of tracking the pathways through which PFAS are broken down.
Generally, even when organisms can break some of the bonds within PFAS molecules, those pathways do not completely neutralize the compounds. Instead, they may simply leave different PFAS or PFAS components at their stopping points.
Furthermore, fungi typically grow in the upper layer of soil and may not reach deeper contaminants. The method is therefore best suited to remediating surface-level and shallow soils, Mouser said.
Graves acknowledged these challenges and said the difficulty of tracking PFAS through many different channels of decomposition had already challenged her process. There are thousands of PFAS chemicals and products, and many cannot be easily detected. For this reason, Graves is focusing specifically on PFOA first. She hopes detection technology will continue to advance, allowing her to learn more in the future.
For now, she is moving ahead with her proposal and hopes to begin propagating mushrooms on site in the spring. Graves has worked with the Department of Environmental Services on the proposal, which was met with interest and will be partially funded by the department, she said. As of Nov. 25, she had requested about $7,000 for the pilot project to pay for tests that would determine baseline PFAS contamination in soil and fungi; it was not yet clear how much funding the project would be awarded.
Also unclear was whether the study would be allowed to proceed on actual Saint-Gobain property. Though the plant was demolished in July, the property is still owned and managed by the multi-national corporation. If the company does not agree to allow the study on its land, Graves plans to work with adjacent landowners to site the pilot plot.
At a meeting of the Commission on the Environmental and Public Health Impacts of Perfluorinated Chemicals on Nov. 14, Merrimack Democratic Rep. Wendy Thomas expressed enthusiasm about the pilot program. “Angie has a very exciting proposal,” she said later in an email.
Graves said she wants to see the PFAS contamination in Merrimack resolved to ease health concerns and water filtration struggles for her community. Her hope, she said, is that those affected by and working to remediate the former Saint-Gobain site continue to press ahead toward an eventual solution, even when progress may feel incremental.

Her foster parents battled to adopt her. The case landed at the state Supreme Court.,"On July 17, 2017, at the Carl Robinson Correctional Institution, Inmate Number 230558 was issued a disciplinary report, placed on a 60-day probationary period and moved into a more secure dormitory for trying to carry contraband into a supervised visit. 
The visit was with his 2-year-old daughter, Jewelyette.
The contraband in question: a crayon.
Inmate Number 230558, known outside the prison as John Masserio Jr., would later write to the parole board that he had only wanted to “color and make a memory with my daughter.” He didn’t want the indiscretion to hinder his efforts to get his daughter out of foster care when he was released.
“Did I just seal my fate?” he asked the parole board.
Masserio was granted probation and released in 2018. When he left, he donated a set of crayons for other prisoners to use during visits with their children. Then he continued his fight to regain custody of his daughter.
What unfolded over the next few years was a complicated legal and emotional journey for everyone involved — Masserio; John and Diana Norman, the foster family caring for his daughter; and Jewelyette herself. 
Masserio spent that time imploring officials at the state Department of Children and Families to help him get his daughter back. Meanwhile, the Normans battled to adopt Jewelyette and for their legal right to have a say about what would happen to the child who lived with them for seven years.
That legal battle would wind its way through appeals and eventually land before the state Supreme Court, which overturned 2023 case law and established that foster families have the right to be legal intervenors in some cases involving foster children.
The case, which irrevocably changed the course of Jewelyette’s childhood, occurred amid a persistent national debate about the best role for foster parents in court hearings. Foster family advocacy groups want more legal rights, while biological families and their advocates say it makes it harder for children to reunify with their families.
The Connecticut Mirror conducted interviews and exchanged messages with Masserio over the course of two years, interviewed the Normans, spoke with dozens of experts and people involved with the case and reviewed thousands of pages of documents related to Masserio’s case.
At the heart of Jewelyette’s story is a fundamental tension of the foster care system itself: some families foster to adopt, or fall in love with a child and decide to adopt, even while biological families fight to get their children back. 
During his August 2017 parole hearing, Masserio asked the Connecticut Board of Pardons and Paroles for a chance, saying that he feared if parole was denied, his parental rights would be terminated.
“I am asking you to please give me this chance to be reunited with my daughter and preserve my family,” he said in his opening statement.
After about 20 minutes of questioning, some of which centered on the crayon incident, the board granted Masserio parole. He was released a few months later, but the struggle to get custody of Jewelyette was far from over.
The beginning
Masserio, a tall man with broad shoulders and brown eyes that crinkle at the edges with his smile, described the day his daughter was born as “the best day of my life.” His partner chose the name, but Masserio decided how to spell it.
He wanted it to be special, something just for her, he said in an interview. 
“She is precious to me, like a jewel,” he wrote in a folder of notes about the custody case. 
Before they had a child, Jewelyette’s mother was using drugs and Masserio was drinking, according to DCF documents. The police were called repeatedly to their home for domestic disturbances.
But when he found out his girlfriend was pregnant, Masserio said he tried to get sober, but had setbacks, as there are with many sobriety journeys. When Jewelyette was born in 2015, she tested positive for exposure to substances and went through withdrawals. She had to stay in the neonatal intensive care unit for weeks while she recovered.
Over the next several months, Masserio struggled with his sobriety. He was pulled over in 2016, and charged with his third-ever DUI. This one landed him in prison, where he served a sentence with a three-year maximum that began in June 2016.
DCF records show that he regularly attended his monthly supervised visits with his daughter, even while incarcerated. In letters, he asked the cousin Jewelyette lived with for more — more updates, more photos, more contact with Jewelyette.
“Jewelyette is so adorable,” he wrote to the family member. “Please put yourself in my shoes for 1 min. She is my only daughter and I will never give up on her.”
As for Masserio, DCF workers noted that his maximum release date was three years away. 
“His maximum release date is 5/26/19, therefore he will not be available as a reunification or parenting resource for Jewelyette … in a reasonable time frame,” they wrote in the documents that recommended terminating his rights. “Even if he is released early, he will need a period of time to reestablish housing, employment.”
DCF then pursued a plan to terminate both biological parents’ rights to Jewelyette so she could be adopted by her foster family.
Jewelyette had, at this point, been in foster care for more than 15 of the last 22 months. Federal law mandates that a child must be on a path to permanency within that timeframe — either in the process of adoption or reunification.
Advocates for family preservation say the timeline punishes families who have trouble finding housing, for example, or parents who are incarcerated.
“The ASFA [Adoption and Safe Families Act] timelines, which is what we’re talking about here, are an obscenity as well, in that they do not count what’s called relational permanence. He’s visiting, he’s trying to maintain contact,” said Richard Wexler, executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform.

DCF works with the Department of Correction to facilitate visitations between parents and children. Parents also still have the opportunity to participate in administrative hearings and to come to court when necessary, said Ken Mysogland, DCF’s chief administrator of external affairs.
DCF also tries to connect recently incarcerated parents with services, officials said.
“It’s difficult for parents to have access to services, to address the reason why the children came into care. Visitation is limited when parents are incarcerated, and we have to take into consideration the length of time that a parent may be incarcerated,” said Maritza Velez, chief of child welfare at DCF. “We have to think about, what does that mean, and how does that impact a child?”
Masserio appealed decisions and attended hearings. His files show he took courses in anger management, attended group sessions to talk about sobriety, and took a parenting class. 
Another home
At the age of 2, as her father entered his second year of incarceration in 2017, Jewelyette was moved to a new foster home after the first adoption plan fell through. DCF told the new foster family the agency was pushing to terminate parental rights.
That family was the Normans. 
John Norman was on the fence about having children until he met his now-wife, Diana Norman. Their friends had children, and seeing them become parents convinced Norman. The Normans quickly learned they couldn’t have biological children, however, so they decided to adopt.
In 2014, they got licensed as foster parents, and Norman said DCF put them on the “foster to adopt” track. DCF officials say they always make it clear that foster placements are temporary, but Norman says that was far from true in their case.
“Typically, when a child comes into care, the plan is reunification,” Velez said. That isn’t always possible, she added, but it’s what DCF strives for.
Despite those goals, Connecticut children who come into foster care are less likely, on average, to be reunified with their parents, according to federal data. About 39% of children who exited foster care in Connecticut in fiscal year 2024 were reunified with their parents, compared to 45% nationally. In Connecticut, about 29% of children who left foster care in fiscal year 2024 were adopted, compared to 27% nationally. Others age out of the system.
The Normans adopted their older daughter, Peyton, after fostering her for two years. Jewelyette, then 2, was placed with them on the day of their daughter’s 4th birthday, and in a family of mild-mannered, quiet people, she was loud. They called her “the megaphone.” 
“It was funny,” Norman said. “Jewelyette was just loud, which we liked.” She was a happy child, he added.
John Norman agreed to be interviewed for this story, but his wife did not join him because she still finds the topic too distressing to discuss. 
DCF workers told them it would be “the easiest case” because her mother’s parental rights had already been terminated and they planned to terminate her biological father’s rights in a matter of months, Norman said.
“So we took her. Ten years later, she’s still …,” Norman said, trailing off. “Things don’t always work out the way they tell you.”
They gave her a bedroom all to herself, which was painted green and decorated with Minnie Mouse ears. They put her in tae kwon do and swimming lessons, took her to specialists for her allergies. When they played family games, their older daughter and Diana Norman would be on one team, and Jewelyette and John Norman on the other. He said she was his “little buddy.”
“My wife and I’d be in another room, and just out of nowhere, Jewelyette would be like, ‘Daddy, I love you,’ same with my wife, and so it kind of breaks my heart the way this went down,” he said, tears in his eyes.
Meanwhile, Masserio worried about his daughter’s psychological well-being because she withdrew and acted out during visits, he said.
Over time, the friction between Masserio and the Normans became obvious. There were frequent irritants and misunderstandings, such as Jewelyette spelling her name differently, which Masserio said was done at the foster family’s behest. Gone was the “Jewel” that he’d given her. She scribbled “Juliet” at the top of her math homework.
Norman said this was an accident. They planned to change the spelling of her name once she was adopted, so her teachers taught her to write it both ways. The shorter spelling — Juliet — was easier and stuck with the child.
During one visit, she told Masserio that Norman was her real dad.
“You’re not my daddy, I can only have one daddy,” he recalled her saying. “My Mommy and Daddy hate you,” she said another time.
“They’re just tearing at my heart,” Masserio said in a 2023 interview. By then, Jewelyette was 8. 
Norman said that’s not true, that he thinks Jewelyette didn’t understand the concepts of a biological family or a foster family.
“I think in her head, I’m her dad. He’s the guy in the visits is what she would say,” Norman said. 
I have moments that it’s between heartbroken and frustrated, and that it went down this way. I keep thinking back to all the things we should have done. John Norman
Masserio, the second youngest in a household of seven siblings and step-siblings, wanted her to be connected to her family as much as possible. He took her on a visit to John D. Masserio Park, named for his father, in Berlin. The family had donated the land to the town to create the park.
For a while, even though he’d found an apartment and ran a construction company, Masserio tried to get on board with the adoption plan. He suggested to the Normans that they enter an open adoption. He wanted to see Jewelyette at least twice a year — sometime around her birthday and Christmas — and asked for school pictures to be mailed to him every year.
They declined, instead offering only school pictures and occasional written updates.
Norman said he and his wife didn’t trust John to stick with that plan and DCF was still on the path toward terminating Masserio’s parental rights, so they didn’t think they needed to make a deal.
“I have moments that it’s between heartbroken and frustrated, and that it went down this way,” Norman said. “I keep thinking back to all the things we should have done. That offer about the open adoption agreement, that sort of thing, I think about things like that. So if we only pursued that more.”

Reunification
In 2020, Masserio and Jewelyette got a new team of DCF social workers. This isn’t uncommon for DCF, where about a third of newly hired workers leave the agency within a year, and another 20% leave in the second year.
The agency is examining ways to improve its retention rate, including hiring a new director of organizational development to look at recruitment.
“Turnover can negatively impact the length of time it takes to achieve a positive outcome on a case,” DCF’s Mysogland said.
Jewelyette’s journey through the foster care system veered when the new team took over. They shifted her permanency plan, aiming to reunify her with Masserio.
For Masserio, it was a relief, an acknowledgement that he’d been right all along — his daughter belonged with him.
For the Normans, it sparked different emotions altogether. They filed motions asking to be party to the court case; Jewelyette had lived with them for seven years, and they thought she should stay with them.
“All Jewelyette ever said was, ‘I want to be adopted. I want to be a Norman,’”  Norman said.
There are sundry reasons a case plan might switch from adoption to reunification, but they tend to boil down to the biological parents making some change that convinces DCF they are able to provide a safe and stable home for their child.
“Our decisions are very fluid, and so we could easily be heading down the track of TPR [termination of parental rights], but until that TPR is granted, we provide services to the family, continue to provide visitation, continue to assess the progress that the family is making,” Velez said.
The voice of the child is also a point of consideration. Jewelyette changed her mind frequently, according to court documents, and Masserio said her foster parents tried to influence her decision.
A DCF reunification readiness report noted that Jewelyette reported that her foster mother would scream at her if she said she had a good visit with her father, a claim the Normans deny. The worker said it seemed Jewelyette would report bad visits, even if she seemed to have a good time, to make her foster family happy.
“This clinician understands that if this child is removed from the care of FP [foster parents], the negative influence against her father as reinforced by FP will decrease and even disappear, and this will help the child to stop her pretending behavior that she does not like father. This child will be able to value and enjoy her father completely and her paternal family as well if there is nobody telling her the opposite,” the report says.
“The relationship of this child with her father will be made whole with reunification, helping this child to gain emotional stability.”
Norman said he and his wife avoided saying negative things about Masserio in front of Jewelyette. He said it was frustrating that DCF interpreted Jewelyette telling the Normans that she didn’t want to be with her father as anything other than her true feelings.
“I know there’s times she told us things just to make us happy, or things we wanted to hear. And so we knew that, and we talked to her about it,” Norman said. “I honestly believe Jewelyette’s voice wasn’t heard throughout this whole process.”
Legal filings
Whether and to what degree foster families should be allowed to participate in custody court cases has long been a subject of national debate. Connecticut law requires that foster families be given the opportunity to testify so they can tell the judge what they think is best for the child.
Generally, people involved in the child welfare system exist along an ideological spectrum.
One one end, there are abolitionists, like Wexler, who believe the entire system is built on surveillance and separation of families. They think it should be abolished and a new system should be built from the ground up; that new system ought to be established on provision of services and keeping families together.
On the other end, there are advocates who think the state is too quick to favor family unification. Some believe foster parents should have more rights and that adoptions and termination of parental rights should be easier.
Connecticut has advocacy groups working on both ends of the spectrum to make changes to state law and DCF policy.
If I kidnap a child at birth, flee to Mexico, take really good care of him and come back in two years, can I keep him? That’s the equivalent here.Richard Wexler, National Coalition for Child Protection Reform
Research shows it’s best for kids to stay with their biological families whenever possible. The majority of children are taken from their homes during neglect cases, which are tied often to poverty, according to federal data. 
A group of Connecticut foster families in 2022 lobbied the state legislature to pass a law offering them more rights. That law didn’t pass, but they kept trying. 
“Foster parents are the ones on the front lines each and every day; we see what our children go through, and we understand the system very well,” Crystal Laffan, the group’s organizer, said in written testimony. “Yet we are rarely, if ever, consulted in our children’s cases nor in the policies governing their precious lives.”
Laffan told lawmakers on the Children’s Committee in early 2023 that she’d like foster parents to have the automatic right to intervene after a case has gone on for a year.
The law as written didn’t pass, although earlier this year, the legislature passed a law requiring DCF to develop a “foster parents’ bill of rights.”
Laffan said Indiana has one of the strongest pro-foster parent laws in the country. Initially, she and her group advocated for a version of that law, known as “Judah’s Law,” named for a 4-year-old who was tortured and killed by his biological father. He’d been placed there a few months before he was killed after being in foster care all his life.
The Indiana law sparked several other efforts in states across the country, including Connecticut.
The Normans were granted intervenor status in 2021, but claim their rights were violated. They argued they didn’t get enough opportunity to speak to the judge and were removed from hearings.
DCF filed to place Jewelyette with her father in 2021, but a judge ruled against the agency, and the girl stayed with her foster family.
In July 2023, a state appellate court ruled in a different case that a foster family should not have been allowed to intervene in a custody case involving their elementary-aged foster son, Ryan C. The case law offered an avenue for DCF’s attorney to shut down the Normans’ attempt to be a part of Jewelyette’s case.
Abolitionists like Wexler liken the idea of a foster family getting attached and trying to adopt a child to kidnapping.
“If I kidnap a child at birth, flee to Mexico, take really good care of him and come back in two years, can I keep him? That’s the equivalent here,” Wexler said. “They didn’t commit an illegal act in taking the child, but in terms of the notion that simply taking the child by force of law in this case, and holding the child somehow entitles you to that child forever is obscene.”
Acting Child Advocate Christina Ghio, who represented the Normans in their appeals when she was in private practice, said foster parent intervention should be rare, but possible. She said foster parents already have the right to be heard in court.
“There are times when the foster parent has information that would be helpful for the judge to have in making decisions that other parties may choose not to bring to the judge,” Ghio said. “A motion to intervene is only going to happen when there’s some really significant concern, and the foster parents don’t see another vehicle for raising those concerns.”
Even Dorene Masserio-Beach, one of Masserio’s older sisters, said it’s not clear what should be done.
“It’s a really, really tough thing, and I feel bad for them [the foster family] because they had this child ripped away from them,” she said.
DCF has in recent years worked to build better relationships between biological and foster families by holding meetings between the two early on and encouraging the foster families to ask questions of the biological family, such as about the child’s bedtime routine or favorite snacks.
Foster parents are the ones on the front lines each and every day; we see what our children go through, and we understand the system very well. Yet we are rarely, if ever, consulted in our children’s cases nor in the policies governing their precious lives.Crystal Laffan, foster parent
The damage to those relationships, if foster families intervene in court cases, is a concern for DCF, Mysogland said.
“What we don’t want is for that to be an adversarial relationship between the foster parents and the birth parents,” Mysogland said. If foster families become party to the case “that certainly may lead to this adversarial relationship, which is counter to the quality parenting work we are trying to build, which we know is so successful for children and families.”
After the Ryan C. case decision was released, Jewelyette and her father moved more quickly toward reunification. They had more frequent and longer visits. He prepared a room for her at his home, painting it pink and hanging curtains with his sister.
For years, he’d been buying Jewelyette clothes and toys, hoping for the day she would live with him again. The room overflowed with stuffed unicorns, plastic horses and books.
“He was so excited,” said Karleen Masserio-Giarratana, Masserio’s older sister. “He was ready to spoil that girl.”
She tried to talk him into taking some of the clothes and toys back because no one child could use that much, she said, but he refused. He was making up for lost time.
In August 2024, Jewelyette moved into her father’s Farmington apartment, and had a handful of supervised visits with the Normans, who were still appealing for custody in court.
Her foster family didn’t have any warning that she would be taken, Norman said. His wife and daughter went on a trip that week, and it was supposed to be a week he spent with Jewelyette. He still recalls walking around the empty house, wishing it was filled with her presence.
Over the following months, Jewelyette’s mental health declined, and she threatened to hurt herself, according to court documents. She wanted to see her foster parents, but Masserio was afraid they’d take her again. Over months of therapy and other services, she adjusted, her father said.
By Christmas, he said, she was settled in at her new home. Meanwhile, the Normans pushed their appeal of the decision to the Supreme Court. Norman said he still thinks they would be a better home for Jewelyette. At their home, she had two parents, a pet dog and a sister. They were stable, and he saw Masserio as a risk.
“We raised her from 2 to 9,” Norman said. “She was part of our family, and I know we’re not biological, but she was our daughter — is our daughter.”
‘Never gave up’
Masserio and Jewelyette lived in a second-floor walkup apartment in a home without an in-unit washer and dryer. When the opportunity arose to move into a first-floor unit that was larger and offered easier access to laundry, Masserio jumped at the chance.
He started moving their belongings downstairs in early January 2025, despite the cold and snow. Then, 9-year-old Jewelyette got sick, spiking a fever and coughing. She had the flu, and Masserio responded with the fear of a first-time parent and stayed by her bedside through the night, listening to her breathe.
She recovered within a few days, and he continued the move. He kept going, moving them into the new apartment, even when he felt tired and weak and his own fever spiked. 
On Jan. 10, Jewelyette hid in the bathroom and called her foster parents. Her dad was sick and sleeping all day and she hadn’t eaten, she said. Norman suggested she call 911.
In the call recording obtained by CT Mirror, the 911 operator stayed on the phone with her until the police arrived. Jewelyette whispered at moments and seemed to cry during others. She wanted to go back to the Normans, she said, and she was hungry. 
In the call, she referred to both Masserio and Norman as her dad.
Police arrived and noted she needed treatment for mental health issues. Masserio told them she was in intensive therapy.
Days after the incident, Masserio called his middle sister, a nurse, and told her he was having trouble catching his breath. She called an ambulance to take him to the emergency room, where he was diagnosed with a bad case of the flu.
When he arrived at the hospital, the doctor said he was severely dehydrated, that years of smoking would make it harder for his lungs to heal, and that he was in renal failure. Masserio-Beach knew her brother didn’t have much time left.
“It totally flipped his world upside down once he became a dad,” she said. “He just never wanted her to feel like he gave up on her. Sadly, he didn’t take care of himself when he got the flu.”
Doctors told the family that the outlook was grim. He’d weakened his body with the move and failed to care for himself in his urgency to care for his daughter. Jewelyette visited briefly, although he wasn’t conscious. 
She made a card for her father with a drawing in crayon of the two of them —both smiling, with thought bubbles above their heads that say “I love you,” and a broken heart above them. The top of the card says “me with out you is inposible.”

A card Jewelyette made for her father when he was in the hospital. 
“I am going to be lonle with out you,” she wrote in a child’s scrawl. “I all wees will love you.”
A nurse read it to him and wrote Jewelyette a note after Masserio died on Jan. 21, just five months after he’d gotten his daughter back. The nurse told the girl that when she told Masserio he had a card from Jewelyette, he raised his eyebrows, assuring her that he could hear and comprehend what she was saying.
After her father’s death, Jewelyette moved in with Masserio-Giantarra. The child handwrote thank you notes to everyone who sent cards or flowers for her father’s funeral. His obituary noted that their relationship, and his devotion to it, is the quality he’d be most remembered for.
“He was a father whose love for his daughter was boundless, a quiet strength in every experience they shared, a hidden knight as he pushed against the tides, always fighting for his little girl,” it said. “His heart was a sanctuary for her, always protecting, always guiding and in his care, she knew the truest form of love.”
Three months after Masserio died, in March, the Connecticut Supreme Court overturned Ryan C. case law and said the foster parents should have been granted intervenor status in Jewelyette’s case.
The ruling opens the opportunity for foster parents across the state to intervene in legal cases, but for the Normans, it did no good. Masserio was dead, the case ended. Jewelyette was on her way to permanency with her father’s family.
“It won’t help us,” Norman said, of the ruling. “I guess it will help other families.”
They still haven’t gotten over their loss. Norman said his wife still can’t talk about what happened, and that his daughter still puts the clothes she outgrows into Jewelyette’s old bedroom, waiting for the girl she considered her sister to come home.

Adoption
As he lay dying in the hospital, Masserio said he wanted his daughter to be with his family.
Masserio-Giantarra and her husband, Sal, filed for legal guardianship so they could adopt Jewelyette. Compared to the reunification process and previous adoption pushes, this moved quickly. 
Jewelyette had her official adoption ceremony in June.
The New Britain courtroom was filled with family members and at least a dozen DCF workers who’d interacted with Masserio and Jewelyette over the years. Many carried balloons or flowers for the girl, whose 10th birthday was the day after her adoption.
Jewelyette donned the last dress Masserio ever bought her for the occasion, smoothing the tulle blue and purple skirt as she sat beside her aunt in the courtroom. The tiara he’d bought her when she was younger glittered on her head.
It was a moment of profound happiness tinged with profound grief. After all these years, Jewelyette was welcomed home, but her father wasn’t there. The case was closed, but it wasn’t the ending anyone had initially hoped for.
“This has gone on for far too long, and ultimately, the greatest impact has been on you, Jewelyette. I want to acknowledge that you are handed circumstances you never asked for,” Jewelyette’s attorney Deetta Roncone-Gondek said in a statement at the hearing.
“I will never forget the sound of your father’s voice saying your name,” Roncone-Gondek said. “The look he had on his face when speaking to you, interacting with you, is one that will be etched in my memory forever. Your banter with him, the way you made him laugh, the joy you both shared in my presence; Jewelyette, carry him with you always.”
She and the guardian ad litem recommended that the judge approve the adoption.
At the attorney’s words, Masserio-Giarratana planted a firm kiss on Jewelyette’s left cheek while the girl wiped tears off the right.
Jewelyette carried a photo of her and her father, their heads pressed close together and noses wrinkled in a smile, to the adoption ceremony, and wrote out a statement to read to the judge. With a nudge from her aunt, she stood, eyes on the paper.
“I wanted to say thank you guys for helping me get here and not giving up,” she said, her small voice cracking. “We all know my dad has passed, but I thank him because he says ‘I’ll never give up on my daughter. I love her,’ and I love him very much.”
At the end of the ceremony, the judge invited her to join him at the bench.
It was with the wide smile inherited from her father on her lips and the hint of a giggle in her voice that she banged the judge’s gavel.
“Court is adjourned,” she crowed. She gingerly placed the gavel back on the desk, then rushed down the steps, tumbling into her family’s waiting arms.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/FOSTER-CARE-05-e1764613544704-1024x793.jpg,,,2025-12-02 05:57:41.380059

If you or someone you know needs support now, call, text or chat the 988 Lifeline.
Operators of group homes for Ohioans with mental illness gathered in Columbus this week to hear about where care and funding are headed for some of the neediest Ohioans.
The Ohio Adult Care Facilities Association is a statewide trade association representing operators of adult group homes for those with severe and persistent mental illness. 
The group sprang from the National Alliance on Mental Illness of Ohio, a non-profit organization.
About 100 homeowners and operators attended the association’s annual conference to learn about topics ranging from funding and Medicaid cuts to finding new residents and administering critical psychiatric medications.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
While they come from different backgrounds and parts of the state, group homeowner operators have one thing in common: they are not in it for the money. 
More often than not, owners struggle to pay for home upkeep, feeding, transporting, and caring for residents, many of whom don’t have family members to depend upon.
Richard Barnes Jr., who operates Barnes Caring Services in Toledo, received the association’s Resiliency Award after he took on second and third jobs to pay for home repairs.

Dawn Campbell Lavey, operator of three facilities in the Lancaster area, got the Lifetime Achievement Award for decades of advocacy for those with mental illness. 
“She has changed the world for many people in need,” her award nomination said.
Lavey was first exposed to mental health issues when she was 13 and working in a nursing home. 
After she graduated from Baylor University, she saw a real need for helping mentally ill patients. 
“My passion has always been for the indigent and the mentally ill,” she said.
Raven Oglesby, executive director of the Ohio Adult Care Facilities Association, provided some troubling news about funding in view of federal cutbacks but followed it up with a pep talk.
“We are advocating for you and you should start advocating for yourself,” Oglesby said. 
She urged home operators to look to state psychiatric hospitals, county jails, homeless shelters, and mental health agencies to find residents to fill empty beds in their homes.
The group homes are predominantly located in five urban areas of the state – Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Dayton, and Toledo. Many parts of Ohio have no designated group homes.
The need for homes for adults with mental illness developed quickly about 20 years ago when the state closed ten psychiatric hospitals, pushing some of the most vulnerable, severely ill people into homeless shelters, private homes, hospitals, jails, and to the streets.
As a result, Residential Class 2 Adult Care Facilities were established, mostly private businesses or through faith-based organizations.
Funding has been a problem since day one.
Money to operate the homes comes from private payments, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) funds, scarce local dollars from county mental health boards, private fundraising, and the Residential State Supplement program operated by the Ohio Department of Behavioral Health (formerly the Ohio Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services). 
The residential state supplement allocation is $1,600 per month per resident. The state is paying $23.3 million annually for the supplement to about 2,500 home residents.
Sonya Durosinmi-Etti, the association’s board president and a Columbus home operator, said she is motivated by helping others not making money from her business.
“We have such a passion for what we do. We love our work. We love our residents,” she said in an interview.
Officials from the Ohio Department of Behavioral Health updated conference attendees about on-going programs, including the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline which received 592,294 calls and text messages for help in the first three years of operation. 
It takes an average of 23 seconds for an operator to answer calls and texts at one of 19 call centers around Ohio.
Roma Barickman, head of Housing and Homelessness Policy and Programs for the state, has worked for many years with people who provide homes for those with mental health issues who might otherwise have nowhere to go.
“I love the passion in this room,” she said. “I love what you do for your residents. But you are also a business. You have your compassion hat and you have your business hat.”

In comments submitted to the U.S. Department of Transportation, they argue that the change is based on unfounded safety concerns about non-citizen drivers and that the restrictions would harm the livelihood of license holders as well as the state’s economy. 
If the rule goes into effect, 100% of current non-domiciled commercial driver’s license holders in Maine would no longer be eligible, according to the Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles. A non-domiciled CDL is issued to people who are legally permitted to work but are not yet permanent U.S. residents. Nationwide, an estimated 97% of current non-domiciled CDL holders would lose eligibility.
In September, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration announced the emergency interim final rule — titled “Restoring Integrity to the Issuance of Non-Domiciled Commercial Driver’s Licenses (CDL)” — which would make it so only green card holders, U.S. citizens and certain employment-based visa holders would be eligible for a CDL. 
But in November, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a stay pending review of the rule, preventing it from taking effect. However, some states have independently decided to no longer issue or renew commercial driver’s licenses to certain foreign-born drivers, including Texas and New Mexico.
The comment period for the rule closed Friday. Several Maine entities weighed in.  
When initially announcing the change, President Donald Trump’s administration cited recent fatal crashes caused by non-domiciled drivers. This issue was thrust into the public consciousness in August when an undocumented truck driver licensed in California and Washington killed three Floridians in a road accident. 
In the Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles’ comments submitted in opposition to the rule, the agency pointed out that the federal government’s data shows that the vast majority of fatal crashes in 2025 were caused by those with regular CDLs, not non-domiciled CDLs. 
Of the 2,399 fatal crashes involving citizen and noncitizen commercial drivers of large trucks and buses in 2025, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration identified five incidents (0.21% of identified fatal crashes) “to blame non-domiciled CDL holders … as an imminent ‘threat to public safety and direct threat to national security,’” wrote Secretary of State Shenna Bellows and Deputy Secretary of State for the Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles Cathie Curtis.
They added, “these isolated anecdotes do not explain any connection between the drivers’ immigration status and the cause of the crashes, and FMCSA acknowledges, as noted above, that it lacks any reliable data demonstrating that the selected category of noncitizens is more likely to be involved in fatal crashes.”
Bellows said in a statement shared with Maine Morning Star that the rule “is yet another cruel attempt by the Trump administration to punish immigrants who are legally here and make their existence here as difficult as possible.” 
Bellows and Curtis also stated in their submitted comments that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration bypassed legally required consultation with states before submitting the rule.  
When announcing the rule, the White House also cited a federal audit that found some states had issued licenses illegally to foreign drivers. California now plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses given to immigrants after discovering the expiration dates exceeded the date the drivers were legally allowed to be in the U.S.
The Maine Immigration Rights Coalition, the convener of a statewide network of about 85 organizations representing diverse ethnic communities, and Maine Equal Justice, a non-partisan civil legal aid and economic justice organization, also submitted comments in opposition, highlighting the benefits of this license to help fill workforce gaps. 
“Maine is a rural state with a high average age, a persistent worker shortage, and industries deeply dependent on immigrant labor,” wrote Ruben Torres, Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition’s advocacy and policy manager. “Commercial driving is a critical pathway to economic security for many of our constituents, particularly asylum seekers and other legally present immigrants who rely on Employment Authorization Documents to work.”
Portland Adult Education has a CDL training pipeline that produces at least 20 newly trained commercial drivers each year, funded with a combination of local, state and federal dollars. Torres wrote that these workers, many of whom are immigrants, have helped stabilize transportation systems across the state by filling vacancies in the public bus system, school bus system and municipal transit operations.
Maine Equal Justice similarly wrote that the rule would interrupt established workforce pathways and burden employers and training providers who have invested resources to grow the commercial trucking industry in Maine. 
The Maine Motor Transport Association estimated in May that the state needs 1,100 more drivers to meet existing demands, and industry experts estimate the new rule could remove about 200 Maine drivers from the road.
Noting this, Maine Equal Justice wrote, “If there are fewer license-holders, existing drivers may have to work overtime or drive longer trips, increasing the likelihood of distracted driving and potential crashes, a result that violates the agency’s own safety rationale articulated in their interim rule.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bus_greaterportlandmetro-1024x733.jpg,,,2025-12-02 04:56:29.072388

Jess Geren’s four children are regular churchgoers — they participate in Christian youth groups and study the Bible at home. When LifeWise Academy, a fast-growing program that allows students to leave school during the day for religious instruction, came to Ayersville Local Schools, their northwest Ohio district, she saw it as a chance to spread the gospel.
“It’s not my kids that I worry about,” she said. “This is their opportunity to be a light. Their mission field is the public school.”
For many other Ohio parents, that’s a problem.
Since he was 8, Cherie Khumprakob’s son, now 11, has been receiving written invitations from classmates to join them at LifeWise. She found one in his backpack.
“He hates getting these notes from his friends and having to tell them ‘No’ repeatedly,” said Khumprakob, who lives in the Columbus area. “Training kids to pressure their friends into religious activities while at public school, during school hours, crosses a line.
Kids who attend LifeWise often return to school with invitations for their friends. Some parents are opposed. (Photo courtesy of Cherie Khumprakob.)
The opposing views illustrate the tension in Ohio and other states where LifeWise is rapidly expanding. The $35 million organization expects to serve close to 100,000 kids in 34 states this school year. It has 1,600 employees and runs its own fleet of eye-catching red buses.
Founded in 2018, LifeWise is the most visible group behind a movement to spread off-campus religious instruction during the school day. Since 2024, the nonprofit has successfully lobbied for legislation in Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas mandating that districts allow students to attend LifeWise or similar programs. Some say the requirements violate the separation of church and state.
“That’s a big shift,” said Mark Chancey, a religious studies professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. “This whole mandatory aspect is historically something different.”
In a moment when Republicans are fighting to hang the 10 Commandments on classroom walls and squeeze biblical passages into reading lessons, LifeWise has taken these programs in a more evangelical direction. The organization faces pushback from parents and district staff who think Bible study should be relegated to afterschool hours. LifeWise programs that reward students with items like candy and encourage kids to recruit their friends have proven particularly divisive.
But those are the strategies LifeWise recommends as a way to increase participation. “Send students back to school with ‘Invite a Friend’ flyers,” urges a tip sheet on “boosting enrollment.” A Q&A document says treats are “fun incentives” that are meant to foster a “positive and engaging learning environment.”
“Most students who enjoy a sport, activity or program will talk about it with their friends and encourage them to give it a try as well,” said LifeWise spokeswoman Christine Czernejewski. “Lifewise is no different.”
The 74 found examples of financial transactions between districts and LifeWise that could create the appearance of promoting the program. Especially in Ohio, LifeWise often enjoys strong support from school officials; one superintendent warned staff to avoid such activity while the district was “under the radar.”
Supporters argue that LifeWise and similar classes respect the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause because they require parent permission, don’t meet on school grounds and aren’t supposed to rely on school resources for support.
Some districts are putting “tacks on the road so the big red bus loses air in the tires” just because the program teaches the Bible, said Jeremy Dys, senior counsel with First Liberty Institute, a law firm specializing in religious freedom cases.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The 46,000-student Columbus, Ohio, district banned religious groups from sending kids back to school with any “materials, snacks, clothing, candies, trinkets or other items.” Then the legislature amended the law to say districts can’t prevent organizations from distributing educational materials, but have some discretion over limiting non-educational items like treats. For now, Dys, who represents LifeWise, is waiting to see whether the new restrictions interfere with the program.
“There’s just a lot of animosity and hostility towards religion,” he said. But recent Supreme Court decisions, like one siding with a football coach who held mid-field prayers and another allowing parents to opt their children out of hearing LGBTQ-themed story books, have expanded religious influence at school. “The courts … have basically been telling school districts, ‘Cool it.’ ”
In total, 16 states require districts to allow students to participate in religious studies during school hours, but a few, like Pennsylvania and New York, have had such laws on the books for years. Some states aren’t ready to take that leap. Legislation requiring districts to release students stalled this year in Alabama, Georgia and Nebraska.
At an education subcommittee hearing in February, Georgia state Rep. David Clark, a Republican running for lieutenant governor, said the programs could solve one of the most pressing issues facing public schools — enrollment loss.
“We have thousands of students leaving public schools. It could be private school; it could be home school,” he said. “I think this … protects our public schools, because it allows parents, [if] they want the religious studies, they can sign their kid up.”
Clark alluded to data suggesting that attendance increases and behavior improves in schools with LifeWise programs. The findings, from a 2023 report sponsored by a supporter, are frequently cited by LifeWise founder Joel Penton and officials who pitch the program to school boards across the country.
But some researchers say the report’s conclusions overstate the program’s benefits. Charles Riedesel, a computer scientist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, called the work “shoddy.” For one, it included the COVID year, a time when states changed how they tracked attendance because so many students were learning remotely.

 ‘Blows my mind’

Even though the legislation failed in Georgia, LifeWise still has programs in about six districts statewide, and church leaders are pushing for more.
On a sunny Friday morning in October roughly an hour outside Atlanta, about 20 Cartersville Elementary fifth graders piled onto a LifeWise bus for a short drive to a local church. Ebby McCoy said she was missing a computer class, but likes how the LifeWise lessons “go a bit deeper” into the Bible than what she learns in church.

Former elementary school teacher Danielle Ruff energetically led the kids through a fast-paced lesson on the 10 plagues that the Bible says God inflicted on Egypt for keeping the Jews enslaved. As she spoke, students connected puzzle pieces linking the disasters in order — water turning to blood, frogs infesting homes and gnats “biting them like crazy,” Ruff said.
“The next set of plagues only happen to the Egyptians. They don’t happen to the Israelites,” she said. “It blows my mind every time.”
Jason Morrow, a LifeWise board member, was among several volunteers on hand to help kids locate Bible verses. He called the program a “touchpoint during the week” that teaches his daughter, one of the fifth graders, that faith is “not just a Sunday weekend thing.”
But Clay Willis, who works at the church hosting the program, said LifeWise leaders try to respect the school’s boundaries. For one, they don’t hand out candy.
“If we sugar them up, that’s not the best way to serve the teachers,” he said.

 ‘It’s insulting’

Supporters of LifeWise and similar programs point to a 1952 Supreme Court decision, Zorach v. Clauson, that legalized the practice. But the fact that these programs pull kids out of school during the day offers critics their leading argument. During a meeting last fall, Amber Skinner, a board member in the Worthington, Ohio, district, near Columbus, said checking students in and out of school for their LifeWise session is disruptive and eats up staff time.
“Teachers who are funded with taxpayer dollars” spend time providing a lot of “hands-on assistance” to elementary students who need help signing themselves out, she said.
The classes, usually held once or twice a week, often coincide with non-core offerings like art and music. Some educators think students are losing out on important material.
Alan Limke, a retired STEM teacher from the Milton Union district, outside Dayton, kept a list of the lessons that students missed every Tuesday when they left for LifeWise. They included simple circuits, building and launching foam rockets and 3-D modeling. Leading up to the 2024 solar eclipse, when Milton was in the path of totality, he planned a month of activities, including a visit from a mobile planetarium.
“It’s insulting,” said Limke, who grew up Catholic, but now considers himself an atheist. “I work very hard to come up with lessons that are rigorous and fun and important.”

While LifeWise requires parent permission, specific procedures vary by district, according to Czernejewski, the organization’s spokeswoman. In Ayersville, Ohio, the district Geren’s children attend, the initial permission form remains in effect year to year unless a parent requests a withdrawal. That seems wrong to Nick Sullivan, whose oldest daughter wanted to stop attending after fifth grade.
“You’ve got to send in a paper stating that you do not want your kid to attend LifeWise or they’re going to automatically enroll them,” Sullivan said. He thinks schools should require the permission slips annually, just like other paperwork.
Sullivan withheld his daughter’s name to protect her privacy. Now an eighth grader, she told The 74 she found the LifeWise lessons repetitive and said the instructors “would give us a full bag of candy” for reciting Bible verses.
“I was supposed to be in study hall and they kept on sending me whether I liked it or not,” she said.
 ‘Crossing the line’

Experiences like those contribute to the growing opposition to LifeWise. The Secular Education Association, formed in 2023, keeps a lookout for incidents where they think school officials inappropriately promote the program or allow LifeWise too much access. They’ve found school officials who tout LifeWise in newsletters or post photos on social media with the group’s leaders. Other examples they’ve gathered since 2023 include:

Continental Elementary in northwest Ohio shared a video of a LifeWise representative on its Facebook page in 2022. The woman displayed baked goods students could choose from if they attended a LifeWise fundraiser. “We have yummy brownies, cookies with M&M’s,” she said. “It’s just so beautiful.” The district did not respond to questions about the video.


The Culver district in Indiana, west of Fort Wayne, held a LifeWise-related assembly during school hours last year that caught the attention of attorneys at the Freedom from Religion Foundation. The organization, which advocates for church-state separation, reminded Superintendent Karen Shuman of the district’s policy stating that “no solicitation for attendance at religious instruction shall be permitted on [district] premises.”In an email to The 74, Shuman said the district is “not conducting Lifewise programs” and that she had “no idea” what the assembly was about.


The Supreme Court said religious instruction during the school day should be held off school grounds. The Elmwood Local Schools, south of Toledo, rents space to LifeWise near a school. Superintendent Tony Borton said the lease “has not been an issue in our community.” But last year, he warned against mentioning LifeWise during high school announcements after someone complained, according to an email the Secular Education Association obtained through a public records request. “We are crossing the line with these type things,” Borton wrote. “I am trying to reign in [sic], with the hope we can do more later when we are not under the radar.”

Zachary Parrish, co-founder of the Secular Education Association, grew critical of LifeWise when his daughter was sent to study hall, and missed reading instruction, while other students went to the program. He protested earlier this year outside an annual LifeWise event. (Photo courtesy of Zachary Parrish.)
A 74 analysis of data from GovSpend, a company that tracks government purchases, turned up a few additional examples of expenditures that could raise questions. In 2022, Ohio’s Franklin Monroe school district paid Caleb Crevier, a basketball spinning performer, $800 for a “LifeWise assembly.” A LifeWise representative, Tara Schwartz initiated the event, according to district emails. The district did not respond to questions about it.
Another Ohio district, River View, cut a check for $2,000 to LifeWise earlier this year. The funds came from community members donating to the organization, but were improperly routed through the district, said district Treasurer Kara Kimes.
“I’d like to get these funds cleaned up ASAP as donations that are directly for Lifewise shouldn’t be flowing through the district,” she wrote to another staff member in an email The 74 obtained through a public records request.
Community members in the River View, Ohio district, donated to their local LifeWise program, but an official said those funds shouldn’t come through the district.
Czernejewski, the LifeWise spokeswoman, said the organization does not advise local school districts, but that its “role is to operate in compliance with applicable laws.” She added that she was unaware of school officials promoting the program, noting that LifeWise can submit announcements to district newsletters, just like other community organizations.
 ‘Develop good relationships’

Off-site religious studies during the school day date back to the early 1900s when the Mormon church offered “seminary” classes to students in Granite, Utah.
Around the same time, a Gary, Indiana, superintendent launched an off-site religious studies program, and the concept began to grow across the country.
One of the longest-running examples is School Ministries, based in South Carolina, the first state to allow districts to award elective credit for such programs. Like the lawmaker in Georgia, Executive Director Ken Breivik said the classes allow parents who can’t afford private school “to get some sort of religious experience.” But he thinks forcing districts to release students can spark a “visceral reaction” from school leaders and prefers not to talk much about LifeWise.
“We are just a different organization. We have never done a school board presentation,” he said. He will ask districts to allow a small pilot program before spreading to multiple schools. “We work really hard to develop good relationships with the schools we serve.”
In January, Penton, LifeWise’s founder, joined a Christian broadcaster to discuss an unlikely competitor in Marysville, outside Columbus: Hellion Academy for Independent Learning, or HAIL. The Satanic Temple sponsors the program as an alternative to Christian groups meeting during the school day. The organizers’ intent, Penton said, is “to rattle people” and get districts to stop releasing students for any religious instruction.
HAIL, which focuses on secular humanism rather than Satan worship, began as parent Susannah Plumb’s response to her kids’ classmates leaving school for Joy El Bible Adventure, a Pennsylvania program.
“It’s not in-your-face proselytization, but little kids don’t understand. They see Johnny get on the bus once a week … and go on a field trip,” Plumb said. “My kids felt left behind.”

HAIL meets at a nearby library, where the kids conduct science experiments, launch community service projects and paint “kindness stones” to place in a local park at the end of the year. But she said the program wouldn’t exist if Joy El, LifeWise and others didn’t.
“I believe in the separation of church and state, but I also believe in plurality,” she said. “When there’s one, there needs to be another.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)As of late last year, more than 1,300 children torn from their parents’ arms at the U.S.–Mexico border from 2017 to 2021 had not been reunited with their parents. This figure represents nearly a third of the 4,600 children forcibly separated from their families.
Human rights organizations described this as potentially a form of torture, due to the intentional infliction of suffering and the systemic nature of the separations as an immigration deterrent.
Such measures enjoyed support and even celebration from the American Christian right, leaving many to wonder: What kind of religion endorses such cruelty, the withholding of health care, winking at racism and embracing xenophobia?
There’s little Christian about this, it seems, unless viewed through a theologically Calvinist lens.
The Rev. Robert Johnson, who leads Church of the Resurrection’s new Lee’s Summit location, said the seeming detachment from suffering, tolerance of destructive ideas like “Manifest Destiny” and more likely have Calvinist roots.

“In their minds, God has already chosen,” said Johnson, who earlier led a United Methodist Church in Wichita. “Social justice is viewed as impudence to God’s executed will, and it’s also anti-empathy. In fact, empathy is meaningless.”
In August, PBS News published a story headlined, “Is empathy a sin? Some conservative Christians argue it can be.”
“For them, empathy is a cudgel for the left,” the article explained. “It can manipulate caring people into accepting all manner of sins according to a conservative Christian perspective, including abortion access, LGBTQ+ rights, illegal immigration and certain views on social and racial justice.”
Allie Beth Stuckey, author of “Toxic Empathy: How Progressives Exploit Christian Compassion,” was quoted as saying: “Empathy becomes toxic when it encourages you to affirm sin, validates lies or supports destructive policies.”
Christian right beliefs have buttressed political conservatism for decades, from the Confederacy’s “Lost Cause,” to Jerry Falwell’s “Moral Majority,” to today’s MAGA movement. Falwell’s Liberty University didn’t originally admit Black students. To be fair, not all evangelicals hold such beliefs, but we should try to understand where the beliefs of so many might come from.
A review of Anthea Butler’s “White Evangelical Racism: The Politics of Morality in America,” by Bianca Mabute-Louie, identifies evangelicalism as a nationalist political movement to support white, Christian hegemony. Racism is a feature, not a bug, of the movement.
Butler, according to Mabute-Louie, said, “interpretation of Scriptures, theology, and belief informed evangelicals’ social and political actions, and justified the oppression of African Americans during and post-enslavement.”
Many Americans have been puzzled by evangelicals’ devotion to President Donald Trump despite his lurid personal picadilloes, his seeming lack of religiosity and the cruelty of his recent attempt to deny millions, including children, of food benefits.
Christians and non-Christians alike have asked earnestly how any believer — left, right or otherwise — could support such policies and such a person.
Johnson suggested these beliefs reach deep into 1500-era teachings of John Calvin and “predestination.”
Most students learned about Calvinism from a historical, not religious, perspective. The Pilgrims, for example, were Calvinists. That’s also where the “Protestant work ethic” originated, as well as interpretations of the Bible as “without error.”
Calvin believed that “even before creation,” God had chosen some people for salvation, a belief associated with predestination, according to Christianity.com. Calvin fumed at how Catholicism reduced religion to “salvation by works.”
His refrain? People shouldn’t try to manipulate God nor place Him in their debt. Saved people are saved only Him, not by good works.
“This is the perfect theology for what we see in the evangelical movement,” Johnson said. “This is why they may not consider themselves bigoted or racist. They have found a denominational justification for our racial caste system. It’s why they don’t like social activism. To them, there is no social Gospel, only individual salvation.”
Johnson pointed to the acronym TULIP for understanding.
TULIP stands for total depravity (there’s no good in us), unconditional election (God has already chosen those who prosper), limited atonement (Jesus died specifically for the elect), and perseverance of the saints (the elect will be saved).
John Wesley, a founder of modern Methodism, provided an alternative to this theology for many, including for Johnson.
Wesley, Johnson said, looked at slavery and like Calvin, saw the total depravity. But Wesley also saw God in the tortured enslaved people and heard an ecclesiastical call to rescue them.
“From his deathbed, John Wesley pleaded with people gathered around him to promise to end the scourge of slavery,” Johnson said. “I follow United Methodism in that spirit.”
A photo of a crying toddler caught up in a nighttime border raid remains an enduring image from the first Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy.
The prolonged family separation stemmed from the federal government’s failure to maintain a central database. A 2018 court order halted the practice, and a 2023 settlement requires continued reunification efforts and support through 2031.
But a lifetime of damage already has been done, especially to the children. Pope Leo has called out the “extremely disrespectful” treatment of migrants in the U.S., according to an NPR report.
The question then becomes not if God exists in the crying toddler or her parents, but where is God in a faith tradition that embraces such wanton and intentional cruelty?

In fact, the GOP-led chamber has only worked 14 days since July 25. As Congress sat idle, hardworking Ohioans faced rising health care costs, farmers battled dangerous market instability, and millions may lose necessary food assistance.
It’s time for Congress to show up for the people it serves — to lower costs, raise wages, and protect the freedom to make choices about our own lives. As the Communications and Policy Director for the Rural Democracy Initiative, I worked with 40 local, state, and national organizations — including the Ohio-based Black Appalachian Coalition (BLAC) — to create the Rural Policy Action Report, which offers a roadmap of popular policies lawmakers could implement today.
Here are five priorities to help families, small businesses, and rural communities thrive.
 1. Fix health care.

To start, lawmakers should reverse the Medicaid cuts and renew the Affordable Care Act tax credits that they allowed to expire to pass tax breaks for billionaires.
More than undoing the damage Congress did this year, we need them to go further: lower prescription prices, support rural hospitals, and ensure reliable care close to home. 
Access to life-saving services shouldn’t depend on your ZIP code or your income.
 2. Stand with farmers, not just corporations.

For farmers, rising health care costs are just part of the growing challenges.
“Our members are feeling the pain of a chaotic trade policy, massive cuts to USDA programs that serve all farmers and rural communities, and the ever-growing threat from monopolies that manipulate the agriculture marketplace,” said Aaron Lehman of the Iowa Farmers Union, a contributor to the report.
With the Farm Bill years past due, it seems Congress only makes time to fund programs for the biggest agribusinesses. 
But Congress could help develop local markets by investing in local food systems, reinstating the Local Food Purchase Assistance program that helped schools buy fresh food from local farms, and helping farmers protect soil and water. 
They should retool crop insurance and credit programs so they work for smaller, more diverse farms.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Farmers watched as new tariffs hurt the U.S. soybean market, and boosted sales for Argentina. 
To top it off, the Trump administration promised Argentina an additional $20 billion bailout gift. Congress must rein in our trade policy and prioritize independent producers, small-town businesses, and workers.
 3. Strengthen public schools.

Rural schools are the heart of their communities, preparing students with the skills to compete. 
But the federal government diverted billions from public schools to private schools with a voucher tax credit that could cost taxpayers up to $51 billion a year — more than the federal government spends on all public K–12 education.
Lawmakers should stop the voucher programs and instead ensure students have properly funded schools with speech and reading services and support for kids with disabilities.
 4. Empower workers

Rural workers often earn less, have fewer benefits, and face higher injury rates. When workers are respected and fairly paid, they spend locally and keep main streets alive. 
But the Trump administration has tried to eliminate dozens of worker safety rules, rescinded an important overtime rule, and ordered immigration raids at work sites across the country.
Congress should protect the right to organize, ensure safe work sites, and guarantee paid family and medical leave.
 5. Make essentials affordable

Everyone should be able to afford groceries, medicine, and energy bills — but prices keep climbing. 
Congress must work to lower prices and enable small businesses to be competitive so people have real choices.
Congress should also restore food assistance, cut costs for childcare, housing, and energy, and expand broadband access.
Congress needs to work for us, not for the special interests of big corporations and the ultra wealthy.
Rural communities have been overlooked — or actively harmed — by federal policy. 
The Rural Policy Action Report shows a better path: a practical plan with example legislation to improve health care, support farmers, strengthen public schools, stand with workers, and lower costs.

(Getty Images)Some 135 days after its deadline, Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a bipartisan budget compromise into law and ended a monthslong impasse — but many Pennsylvanians working in home care were shut out of any additional funding, prompting a call for more investment in 2026.
The Pennsylvania Homecare Association seeks to raise Medicaid rates by 23% and invest upwards of $800 million into home care to “stabilize” the industry, citing studies commissioned by the Shapiro administration and a bipartisan legislative committee. But the 2025-2026 budget allotted just $21 million for Direct Care Workers, which the association said helps just 6% of the workforce.

“Pennsylvania’s in-home care crisis is both devastating and straightforward— the workforce is collapsing, and people are going without care,” Mia Haney, the association’s CEO, said in a release. “The Governor and Legislature have taxpayer-funded studies that spell out exactly what must be done. Families are missing hours they’re authorized for, medically fragile children are losing care, and seniors are being left without help. We don’t need more reports — we need leadership.”
PHA represents more than 700 homecare, home health and hospice providers across the commonwealth. The organization filed a formal Program Revision Request for a 13% increase in personal assistance services — at minimum — and a $59 per hour nursing rate in the next fiscal year, which starts on July 1. 
According to PHA, the average hourly reimbursement rate for personal assistance services is “the lowest among neighboring states” at $20.63, a rate that ranges from $36.31 in New York to $25.58 in Maryland. The group added that managed care organizations report that 10% of personal assistance staff hours and 27% of nursing hours are unfilled each month. 
Pennsylvania’s growing senior population is straining home care resources, especially in rural areas, as the Baby Boomer generation reaches retirement age. By 2030, rural Pennsylvanians aged 65 or older are expected to outnumber those under the age of 20.
“Raising rates isn’t an item on a wish list — it’s an absolute necessity for tens of thousands of vulnerable Pennsylvanians,” Haney continued. “This is both a moral and fiscal imperative. Every month of delay costs taxpayers millions and leaves more Pennsylvanians without care. The Commonwealth cannot keep balancing its budget on the backs of vulnerable families and underpaid caregivers.”
 A little more about the budget process

When Shapiro signed the state’s budget into law last month, Pennsylvania’s Office of the Budget was already months into the process for developing the next fiscal year’s funding plan. 
Instructions for state agencies submitting budget requests went out in August, amid the impasse. They directed each to submit “cost to carry budget requests,” or plans maintaining current levels of service. The 74-page document warns agencies that federal funds that are lost — or anticipated to be cut — should be incorporated into their requests.

 
However, “agencies should not request increased state resources to address these impacts in their agency submissions unless directed by the Office of the Budget.”
Agencies submitted their funding requests on Oct. 15. Program Revision Requests, which alter current programs outside of the submitted agency budgets, increase or decrease funding by more than 15% and have more than a $200,000 impact. 
Sometime this month, the governor’s office typically meets with the General Assembly for a mid-year briefing on budget issues and “to apprise them of anticipated spending and revenue levels and to discuss major fiscal issues.” 
The governor’s office then finalizes their budget proposal before a formal submission to the legislature in early February, kicking off negotiations before the June 30 budget deadline.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/NURSE-OLDER-MAN-.jpeg,,,2025-12-02 04:56:29.072388

Bessent announced the investigation via social media, replying to a post from right-wing propagandist Christopher Rufo, who recently published an article claiming that ill-gotten gains from Minnesota have wound up in the hands of al-Shabaab.
Bessent’s investigation would seem to be duplicative, however.
Over the past three years, federal prosecutors in Minnesota have charged 78 people in what they have called the largest pandemic relief fraud in the country, known as Feeding Our Future after a nonprofit that bilked a food aid program out of at least $250 million. They’ve charged others with Medicaid fraud.
They’ve yet to charge a single person with terrorism financing, however, even though the office has a previous history of charging Somalis for ties to al-Shabaab and ISIS.
Federal prosecutors have reported that fraudsters spent their proceeds on lavish purchases, including real estate abroad. But not in Somalia, which has no formal banking system.
The al-Shabaab claim is not new. Fox9 reported in 2018 that child care fraud was funding Al-Shabaab. In his recent article, Rufo even cited the same retired Seattle police detective as the Fox9 story from seven years ago. There were no federal charges leveled then either, and a report from the Office of Legislative Auditor could not substantiate the al-Shabaab connection.
If fraudsters sent money to Somalia via cash remittances to rural areas of the country controlled by al-Shabaab, it’s possible the group would have “taxed” the money and wound up with some of it.
But former U.S. Attorney Andy Luger said recently that the fraudsters were not motivated by ideology. They “were looking to get rich, not fund overseas terrorism,” he told the Star Tribune.
The Star Tribune reports that Gov. Tim Walz said last week that he welcomed an investigation.
“I think it’s the right thing to do,” Walz said. But he added, “I don’t know if they’ll find the connection.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/scottbessent-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 01:57:43.869888
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-02 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Overruled in CT small claims court,James Cornelio,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/02/overruled-in-ct-small-claims-court/,The CT small claims system is broken -- at least as I think most of us would like to think the system should function.,"On August 15 I took part in a remote trial in small claims court seeking to recover several thousand dollars of damages to the heating element in the water pipe serving my home. It was caused by the negligence of a local water and well repair company.
Early on, as I apparently failed to properly follow courtroom protocols, there was some tension between me and the magistrate. But it’s the reasoning for the decision in my case which has caused me to put pen to paper.  If it is in any way emblematic of how magistrates are approaching their duty in deciding the cases before them, then the system is broken, at least as I think most of us would like to think the system should function. 
But before I offer a thought or two about what I think may help to fix that brokenness, let me share some context.
I’m 70 years old and for the 25 years I lived in New York City. Before moving to New Preston in 2008, I was involved in two small-claims cases, one against an auto repair shop and the other against a landlord.  Upon moving to Connecticut, I brought two other claims: one against a furniture store and the other against a restaurant.  And though I only prevailed in three of the four cases, I thought the process in each was fair, and critically to the point of this piece, more concerned with dispensing justice than with rigidly adhering to legal formalities.
In this case however … well, here are a couple of hints of what was to come:
During a settlement conference before an arbitrator prior to the hearing, the attorney for the defendant acknowledged the damage but offered less than a pittance to settle.  As I rejected that, we then went before the magistrate.  There, when the issue of the damage was again raised, I responded that the attorney had already acknowledged the damage.  
Oops, whatever is said in the settlement is not admissible, I was told by the magistrate.  OK, fine, but I told him that I had the damaged element available and could present it to the court.  Oops, again.  No more evidence allowed as, after all, he had earlier stated that all evidence must be presented before the substantive arguments began.
Curious (to say the least) about this ruling, I subsequently queried Chat GPT and learned that even in venues where one might consider legal process to be more important than in small claims court, exceptions to a “no further evidence” rule may be granted for “good cause” or “to prevent a miscarriage of justice.”  But not here, I guess.
Chat GPT, though again after the fact, also challenged the magistrate’s decision to uphold the attorney’s multiple objections to questions I asked his witness because they required “speculation.”  AI will tell you, however, that when a witness is considered an “expert,” speculative questions are allowed.  And this witness, ironically, had been qualified by his own attorney as an expert.  But Perry-Mason-like, I guess I had to object to his objection.
Though other examples abound which might warn one that even in small claims court you better have your favorite AI bot by your side to navigate the legal thicket, how, in the end, did the magistrate rule?  Did he rule that I failed to show that the damage had occurred, or that the defendant had caused the damage, or that I had retained a professional to repair that damage at a cost of several thousand dollars, or that, in fact, the professional had performed the repair?
No.  The evidence which was admitted was just too overwhelming.
So then why did the magistrate rule against me?
Because even though I testified that, of course, I had paid the several month-old bill submitted by the professional I had hired to repair the damage, I hadn’t included in my papers a copy of the cancelled check to that professional.  In other words, though the magistrate didn’t question the defendant’s negligence and the cost to repair the consequent damage, he did question whether I pay my bills.  So, he denied me any relief.
Fortunately, there is a process for opening a judgment in small claims court.  I followed that process and included with it a copy of the cancelled check to the professional who had billed me.  Given the magistrate’s straightforward reason for denying my claim, I thought that with this incontrovertible proof that, as I had testified, I pay my bills, it was a slam dunk.
Unfortunately, though, guess who gets to incontrovertibly decide whether to open the judgment.
From his pen to mine in ruling against me: “The fact remains that the case is now complete and judgment has entered.”  In other words, even if I was wrong in not believing that you pay your bills and even if it cost you a bundle, you lose.
So, what might help in fixin this kind of result?
First, it should be a “slam dunk” that if a magistrate denies recovery because of a specified lack of evidence and if that evidence is then offered when a motion to reopen is submitted, then that motion should be granted regardless of any current legalistic excuses not to do so. Lacking that, the existing process to reopen judgments is not just seriously neutered, it seriously undermines one’s faith in the system. 
Second, to assure an implicit check on power and possible bias, the motion to reopen should be handed over to a set of eyes other than those of the original magistrate.
For the past several years, I feel, as I’m sure do many readers, that our institutions and the people with power over us are failing us.  I just never expected to feel it quite so personally, especially from one institution which I think all of us thought was for justice and fairness over process and empty formalism.

Brown and Dartigue announced last week that the collaborative has been dissolved. (Photo by Willam J. Ford/Maryland Matters)A historic partnership formed with the Maryland attorney general and public defender has come to an end.
Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) and Public Defender Natasha Dartigue announced in a letter dated Wednesday that the Maryland Equitable Justice Collaborative has been dissolved, a little more than two years after its October 2023 launch.
The collaborative — which included working with about three dozen groups that included state agencies, law enforcement personnel and nonprofit and community organizations — has fulfilled its original charge to deliver recommendations on ending mass incarceration, the letter said.
“The structure that guided its work has now reached its natural conclusion. However, the mission and momentum it created are continuing through multiple, coordinated efforts designed to carry the recommendations into implementation,” Brown and Dartigue wrote in the letter.
“Although the MEJC has officially concluded, its core values and partnerships remain strong. The relationships, trust, and ideas built through this collaboration will continue to influence Maryland’s reform efforts,” they wrote.
The collaborative released a more than 100-page report in March with one main statistic: Blacks account for about 30% of the state’s population, but make up about 71% of the state’s prison population. The report also pushed for several criminal justice reform bills that eventually became law this year, such as the Second Look Act.
Maryland Public Defender’s office seeks more help

That legislation, sponsored by Baltimore County Democrats Sen. Charles Sydnor III and Del. Cheryl Pasteur, gives those incarcerated for at least 20 years the ability to petition for a sentence reduction, if they met several other criteria. It excludes sex offenders, people sentenced to life without chance of parole, individuals who were older than 25 when they committed their offense, or those convicted of killing a first responder.
The collaborative also backed medical and geriatric parole, which finally became law this year after being pushed by Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County) for at least four years. It requires parole hearings for those over age 60 who are incarcerated with severe medical conditions.
“Our focus was to really articulate the problem, identify solutions on best practices and make recommendations … to solve the problem of mass incarceration,” Brown said in an interview. “As we are going to this implementation phase, the collaborative isn’t really designed to drive implementation. That I believe is done better through existing structures, whether it’s advocacy groups that do their work in the community or in Annapolis.”
Future work
Some collaborative-backed bills failed this year, but at least one — to stop the state practice of automatically charging youth as adults — will be reintroduced in the 2026 General Assembly.
Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), the chair of the Judicial Proceedings Committee, will reintroduce his bill, which didn’t advance beyond a Senate committee in 2025. His bill would raise the age at which a youth would be tried as an adult, from 14 to 16. It also would have made those 16 and younger eligible for juvenile court if charged with crimes that include first-degree assault, third-degree sex offense and certain offenses involving firearms.
Besides the collaborative, Smith’s proposal has also been endorsed by the Commission on Juvenile Justice Reform and Emerging and Best Practices, which noted in a report that Maryland youth spent 90 to 180 days in adult jails before being transferred back to juvenile court. Federal guidelines say youth must not be held in adult facilities for more than six hours “unless a court finds it is in the interest of justice based on a seven-factor test.”
Gordon Pack, who served on the collaborative’s prison, jail and detention facility reform work group, said Monday he’s disappointed to see the collaborative dissolved.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“I didn’t anticipate that happening, at least not this soon. It allowed people to come together and present different viewpoints,” said Pack, who was released in 2022 after serving 42 years in prison on charges of rape, kidnapping and armed robbery when he was 15.
One particular measure Pack would like to see returned for the upcoming session is parole reform, specifically a measure sponsored by Del. Elizabeth Embry (D-Baltimore City).
Her bill would have required the Maryland Parole Commission to report on the number of cases it has heard and approved in a year, breaking it down by the race of those incarcerated, the number of cases granted or denied, and the number of those eligible for parole but never granted it.

(File Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The Maryland Office of the Public Defender plans to continue pushing its mantra to pursue justice and equity to serve all people fairly — but says it needs help to do so.
Boosting the size of the office to keep pace with an increased workload will be am0ng the office’s main requests to legislators next year, along with trying again to end the practice of charging youths as adults and cutting down on random traffic stops by police.
The office’s workload increased from 85,000 cases in fiscal 2023 to more than 100,000 in fiscal 2025. Public Defender Natasha Dartigue said in an interview last week that the office needs another 550 attorneys and 240 administrative positions, which include secretaries and  paralegals. The office’s 2025 report states it has about 630 attorneys in 52 locations in all 23 counties and Baltimore City.
There’s no price tag for that request yet, but Dartigue put the salary for an entry-level attorney at $85,000, rising to the low $100,000 for an individual with several years of experience.
Acknowledging the state’s fiscal woes — latest estimates predict a nearly $1.5 billion deficit for fiscal 2027 — Dartigue said her request tries “to address our needs, even though that is not going to make us whole.”
“We have to invest in OPD [Office of the Public Defender] because either you’re going to pay it on the front end, or you’re going to pay it on the back end,” she said.
On that point, she noted recent Board of Public Works payments to people wrongfully convicted, like the August payment of $3 million to Baltimore resident James Langhorne, who spent 27 years in prison for a crime he didn’t commit.
She also pointed to a 2023 National Public Defense Workload Study that said excessive attorney caseloads not only affect client representation, as “overloaded public defense attorneys simply cannot give appropriate time and attention to each client,” they can harm communities as well.
“A justice system burdened by triage risks unreliability, denying all people who rely on it – victims, witnesses, defendants, and their families and communities – efficient, equal, and accurate justice,” the report said.
Dartigue said her office is currently working on a new workload study. That report, being done in conjujction with the RAND Corp., will include an assessment of the number of cases and hours spent on juvenile cases. The study produced two years ago focused on adult cases.
In a Nov. 18 legislative briefing, Dartigue asked for the public’s help to “support budget requests.” She also highlighted two criminal justice reform proposals that failed last year, but which her office will push for again in 2026.
Traffic stops
Baltimore County Democrats Sen. Charles Sydnor III and Del. N. Scott Philips plan to bring back a bill to reclassify a number of primary traffic violations — for which police can pull a driver over — to secondary violations.
Their 2025 bills would have made secondary offenses out of driving without a mirror or with obstructed or damaged mirrors, excessive noise, and failure to illuminate a license plate, among others. Drivers could still be cited for those violations, but only after being pulled over for another primary violation.
Sydnor said last week that work continues on drafting a bill for the incoming session that may cut down on the number of targeted primary offenses.
The proposal aims to combat racial profiling, which Sydnor said is even more important now, after a preliminary U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in September that lifted a lower court’s ban on law enforcement officials using “apparent ethnicity” as one factor in determining reasonable suspicion, as long as it is not the only factor.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“You’ve given it a foundation where you give them the go-ahead to racially profile,” Sydnor said of the court’s ruling. “It’s … on us as state officials to protect our citizens from this stuff, and to make certain that our law enforcement is not acting in that manner.”
But Maryland Fraternal Order of Police President Clyde Boatwright said some of the targeted primary violations have “value” such as when a motorist leave a bar at 2 a.m. without the headlights on.
“That person could be pulled over and given a warning [and told], ‘Hey, cut your headlights on,’ or that could be a person that’s driving under the influence of some sort of substance,” said Boatwright, who’s running for Baltimore County sheriff in next year’s election.
‘We care’
Dartigue’s office also plans to again back Sen. William C. Smith Jr.’s (D-Montgomery) bill to ban the state’s practice of automatically charging youth as adults.
Smith, who talked about the legislation last month at a juvenile justice forum at Georgetown University, said eliminating the practice could save the state $17 million, which could be used for mental health treatment and other social services. Smith said at least 85% of cases that involve youth brought into adult court are dismissed or brought back to juvenile court.
Smith to push again for bill to ban automatically charging youth as adults for some crimes

His bill this year would have raised the age at which a youth would be tried as an adult, from 14 to 16. It also would have made those 16 and younger eligible for juvenile court if charged with crimes that include first-degree assault, third-degree sex offense and certain offenses involving firearms.
Boatwright said youth who commit serious crimes are having an “impact on the officers in the line of duty.” He pointed to the case of Baltimore County Police Officer Amy Caprio, 29, who was struck and killed in 2018 by a stolen vehicle driven by Dawnta Harris, then 16. Harris was eventually sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, and another 20 years for burglary. Three other teens in the vehicle, ages 15, 16 and 17, pleaded guilty to felony murder and were sentened to 30 years.
“Young people, particularly minors, involved in violent crime should be able to be held accountable, and the law already provides guardrails on who can be charged as an adult and who shouldn’t,” Boatwright said.
“We care about how experiences impact young people and shape their lives,” he said. “Allowing kids to be kids? Yes, we agree with that statement, to the extent that people are not being severely injured or killed.”
Dartigue reiterated a statistic that hasn’t changed: Maryland ranks second in the nation, behind Alabama, in the number of 14- to 17-year-olds automatically sent to adult court. The number in Maryland rose from 618 in fiscal 2024 to 798 in fiscal 2025.
About 81% of the children charged as adults are Black, compared to a 30% Black population in the state overall.
“We somehow forget that they are children,” Dartigue said. “We, as the adults and the system operators, also have to be accountable to our communities and one another.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Natasha-Dartigue-10-25-2023-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-02 06:56:28.622882

“I have accepted responsibility and am accountable for my actions,” López said in a written statement Monday. “On the advice of counsel, I will not comment further on legal proceedings at this time. I appreciate the support I have received from family, friends, and colleagues.”
In January, a “Ralph Lopez” was charged in Washington, D.C., with driving under the influence and operating a vehicle while intoxicated. That individual was revealed to be López, Maryland’s secretary of Human Services.

A police report said a Metropolitan Police officer saw a car showing several potential signs of impaired driving, such as swerving between lanes multiple times and sitting at a green light, near the U.S. Capitol on the evening of Jan. 8. When the officer pulled López at North Capitol and E streets NW, he noticed López’s “red, watery eyes” and a “strong odor of alcoholic beverage.”
López told the officer he had had two drinks — later he said one drink — between 3 and 6:30 p.m. The traffic stop was a little before 7:30 p.m. López failed a field sobriety test, and a subsequend breath test recorded a breath-alcohol content of 0.097. The legal limit in the District is 0.08.
López was charged with driving under the influence and operating a vehicle while impaired. He initially pleaded not guilty when first arraigned. But on Monday, he pleaded guilty under a delayed sentencing agreement and agreed to perform community service.
According to the D.C. Superior Court, if a defendant pleads guilty under a delayed sentencing agreement and abides by whatever terms come with that plea, they can return after six months and “will be allowed to withdraw their guilty plea and the charges will be dismissed.” If they fail to abide by the terms, a harsher sentence would be applied.
In López’s case, sentencing was deferred for a year. He has another court appearance scheduled for Dec. 1, 2026.

The office’s traffic safety unit is now conducting a full accident reconstruction.
“The process is detailed and complex, particularly when injuries or fatalities occur, or when multiple vehicles, commercial vehicles, potential criminal charges, or unclear circumstances are involved,” the release said. “Investigators are actively interviewing drivers, passengers, and witnesses, and the analysis may take several weeks or longer to determine how and why the crash occurred.”
Reports from the county’s coroner’s office, such as an autopsy, could take up to six weeks.
People who witnessed the crashes are encouraged to reach out to Deputy Benjamin Sears at bsears@arapahoegov.com.
Winter, a Broomfield Democrat who served 11 years in the state Legislature, is survived by her son Tobin, 16, and daughter Sienna, 14. She was engaged to former state Rep. Matt Gray, also a Democrat.
Winter helped advance significant policy related to transit, environmental concerns and family leave.
There will be a memorial for Winter at the Colorado Capitol at 2 p.m. on Friday.

(Photo by C. Anderson/National Park Service)This article was reported and published in collaboration between the Chilkat Valley News and the Alaska Beacon.
Skagway’s former paramedic is alleging wrongdoing by the Southeast Alaska town, saying in a newly filed lawsuit that she was illegally fired after submitting a grievance against the city’s fire chief and deputy fire chief. 
In a lawsuit filed Nov. 20 at Juneau Superior Court, Samantha Philemon — the town’s lone licensed paramedic for much of her employment since 2023 — alleges she was fired due to disputes over recordkeeping and the department’s decision to purchase an all-terrain vehicle known as an Argo.
According to Philemon’s complaint, at the time of her firing, Skagway officials said she was being let go due to violations of HIPAA, the federal medical-privacy law. Philemon’s attorney says in the complaint that the accusation “was a sham.”
Philemon filed a formal complaint against the chief and deputy and was fired by Skagway’s deputy borough administrator the day after the complaint was resolved.
“We’re excited to have our day in court, so to speak, and we think that a jury who hears Sam’s story is going to do the right thing and understand what happened here, and we’re just looking for this to never happen again,” said her attorney, Miye D’Oench of the Anchorage-based Northern Justice Project.
Philemon said her firing has left Skagway, a town of roughly 1,100 year-round residents, without a trained paramedic.
“There are firefighters with EMT 1 and EMT 2 and some (EMT) 3 training, but there are no paramedics, and that harms the community because paramedics are trained and licensed to do things that EMTs are not,” she said.
Neither Fire Chief Emily Rauscher nor Borough Manager Emily Deach responded to requests for an interview that would allow them to respond to Philemon’s complaint.
The borough denied a public records request by the Chilkat Valley News. Robert Blasco, the city’s hired attorney, did not return messages left at his office on Friday and Monday.
Philemon moved from Mississippi to Skagway in 2023, she said, and enjoyed working with the department at first. 
“I wanted to be between the mountains and the ocean,” she said.
According to the complaint, she encouraged a friend to work for the department this past summer, but when he arrived, he was told his position had funding for only one week. Philemon believed that was because the department had recently purchased an Argo. 
When she raised the issue, according to the complaint, “Rauscher and Mead then turned on Ms. Philemon,” and “began silencing and excluding her from department business.” There were additional disputes about medical procedures performed by the fire department and accounting at the department..
Philemon submitted a formal grievance to the borough manager in July. The manager, Emily Deach, said in an August memo that Skagway “will take action to address the behavior and prevent reoccurrence” as well as take steps toward formalizing fire department training. 
“The actions of the department supervisors do not require termination of those supervisors, as 
you requested verbally,” Deach wrote to Philemon.
Philemon, who had been placed on administrative leave while the grievance was investigated, was ordered to return to work under a separate plan. She objected, concerned that she would be returning to work under the same supervisors and conditions as before, and appealed to a committee that included the Skagway Mayor. 
The committee upheld Deach’s work on Sept. 10. Philemon planned to return to work, but the deputy borough manager fired her the following day.
Philemon said she’s been looking for work since then but hasn’t found success.
“I’m looking for a new job after being fired from a job that I never wanted to leave. I’m devastated because I love my job, and I love Skagway,” Philemon said.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Although the country is more divided and democracy is more unstable than he’s seen in his lifetime, former President Barack Obama said young people give him hope for the future. 
Obama shared his thoughts Monday on democracy, civic engagement and understanding others during the inaugural conversation of Building Bridges, a new lecture series hosted by Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art focused on “meeting in the middle with curiosity, courage, and care,” according to a press release. 
After speaking with hundreds of Arkansas students about civic engagement, the former Democratic president spoke to around 700 people who packed into the Heartland Whole Health Institute’s ballroom on Crystal Bridges’ Bentonville campus.
Ahead of the nation’s 250th anniversary next year, museum board chair Olivia Walton, who moderated the lecture, asked about the American spirit. Obama described the country as an“eternally youthful” and “forward-looking nation” where each person can pursue their dreams and there’s a sense of working together to build the country up. 
“The last element, and I mentioned this to the young people that I was speaking to today, of the American spirit is each successive generation deciding we can remake this,” he said. “There’s a process of self-invention that is uniquely American.”

After noting his concern that the country is losing some of those elements, Obama rejected the notion that patriotism means you can’t criticize the country. 
“The reason I think patriotism got politicized is that both the left and the right sometimes got confused in thinking that it was not possible to take an honest look at America’s flaws and be critical of it and still love it and that’s a mistake,” he said. “It is a great expression of love for this country to say that we have not always been perfect, and the reason that we have kept getting better is because we had a bunch of people who said this isn’t as good as we can be, but the ideals were there.”
The first and only African American to hold the nation’s highest office, Obama served two terms after being elected the 44th president of the United States in 2008. Since leaving office, Obama said he didn’t expect to see the legitimacy of an election and the peaceful transfer of power challenged. He’s also been surprised by how the politicization of the Justice Department and the military has been encouraged.
“You don’t have your military involved in partisan politics,” he said. “Its loyalty is to the Constitution. Its loyalty is not to any party and it is not to any president.”
Democracy “absolutely” will survive, Hillary Clinton says in exchange at Crystal Bridges

Obama said it’s concerning to see how people have been willing to overlook the erosion of norms and values in part because of fear of being punished by the state.
“The reason I think that we have found ourselves in a position where we have folks in power who are not abiding as much as I would like with these norms and rules does have to do with underlying divisions in our society that had been building up for some time,” he said. 
There are several reasons for this, Obama said, including political rules, like gerrymandering, that encourage political polarization. Social media has compounded the issue by giving people with the most extreme views the most attention, he said. The country has also lost genuine communities where it’s possible to learn that people are complicated and have nuanced views on issues. 
“This undermines the part of American exceptionalism that I mentioned earlier about us being joiners and us just constantly interacting with people and being in public spaces and getting to know each other and telling each other stories so that we understood each other and gave each other the benefit of the doubt,” Obama said. “That’s what we’ve lost.”
This can’t be solved simply by fixing political rules or electing one party over another, he said. Civic habits underlying these issues need to be addressed. 
One step in that direction will be the opening of the Obama Presidential Center in the South Side of Chicago next year. The space will be a community hub with exhibits, a library and programming to help “train the next generation of leaders,” Obama said.
“The center, it is explicit about championing democracy,” he said. “All our programming, all our displays argue and insist that for all its flaws, it is the best system we got.”
Several Democratic state lawmakers who attended Monday’s lecture said they were inspired by the former president’s speech, including Rep. Tippi McCullough of Little Rock who said she felt “a sense of relief” that the country will get through hard times. Rep. Denise Ennett of Little Rock said she liked how Obama emphasized the importance of leading for everybody, not for one side. 
“I love that he reveres democracy in a time when nobody reveres it at all,” Ennett said. 
For his part, Obama said young people give him hope because of their energy, insights and their natural instincts toward including people and being interested in others even if they’re not exactly like them.  
“I am hopeful as long as young people don’t succumb to cynicism or despair because if they believe in their future, they will lift us all up,” he said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-02 02:16:19+00:00,CT Mirror,AG to CT court: Some General Assembly records aren’t public,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/01/ct-foi-legislature-records-exempt/,"The AG's office argues that all records relating to the ""legitimate ... activities” of the CT legislature are exempt from public disclosure.","The office of Attorney General William Tong is asking a Connecticut court to rule for the first time in the 50-year history of the state Freedom of Information Act that all records relating to the “legitimate legislative activities” of the General Assembly are exempt from public disclosure.
The request was made in an administrative appeal filed Friday in Superior Court objecting to the Freedom of Information Commission’s rejection of an assertion by Tong’s office of a constitutional “legislative privilege” on behalf of the Office of Legislative Management.
“The Privilege is designed to ensure legislative independence from external interference by other persons, entities, or branches of government, and is a critical safeguard of the separation of powers,” the attorney general’s office states in the appeal.
Tong said in an interview that the existence of the legislative privilege is well-established, even if it has never been asserted in a case before the FOI Commission or tested in Superior Court.
“We are not breaking new ground,” Tong said. “This is a time-honored and established privilege.”
The FOI commission, as well as legislative leaders who say they were not consulted by Tong’s office about the appeal or its view of legislative privilege, expressed surprise at how a relatively narrow case was producing a legal showdown over the applicability of the FOI to legislators and staff.
At issue is the meaning of the 55-word “speech or debate” clause of the Connecticut Constitution. Like a similar provision in the U.S. Constitution, the clause creates a legislative privilege intended to protect legislators from arrest or other interference by the executive or judicial branches.
It says, “The senators and representatives shall, in all cases of civil process, be privileged from arrest, during any session of the general assembly, and for four days before the commencement and after the termination of any session thereof. And for any speech or debate in either house, they shall not be questioned in any other place.”
The U.S. Supreme Court has defined the core protection of the federal speech or debate clause as providing lawmakers immunity for statements made in legislative debate, plus “protection against civil as well as criminal actions, and against actions brought by private individuals” and “the Executive Branch.”
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, all said they never had used legislative privilege to withhold documents. None said they were consulted by Tong’s office.
“It’s a broad privilege to assert on behalf of all four caucuses without a conversation,” Candelora said. “On a bipartisan basis, I think the House has an understanding of the Freedom of Information Act as being something that brings transparency and disclosure requirements to public officials.”

Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said lawyers for his Senate Democratic majority caucus had been consulted, though they were deferring to Tong’s office on the question of whether to appeal. The legislature, he said, has a legitimate interest in preserving a measure of privacy.
“We have to have people be able to communicate with each other candidly,” Looney said.
The appeal arises from a complaint filed by John DiIorio, a principal in a defunct mortgage company, 1st Alliance Lending. With some success, he has been using the right-to-know law to explore the rationale behind state banking laws that he says were unfairly used by regulators against his company.
His latest complaint turned on the appropriateness of redactions made in 3,846 pages of emails and attachments. In October, the agency heard arguments from an FOI hearing officer who had reviewed the unredacted documents in private and a lawyer from Tong’s office.
Nicholas A. Smarra, the hearing officer, told the commission he concluded that some of the material was exempt from release as preliminary drafts or the product of attorney-client exchanges, but the rest should be public without redactions.
Assistant Attorney Timothy J. Holzman, representing the legislature, said all the redactions should remain under the privilege created by the speech or debate clause of the state Constitution — a claim never made previously to the commission on behalf of the General Assembly.
“We’re not claiming that everything that comes out of the legislature is covered by the privilege,” Holzman told the FOI Commission. “It’s only things within the legitimate sphere of legislative activity, not administrative stuff, not political stuff.”
Colleen Murphy, the executive director and general counsel of the commission, told commissioners that Holzman’s argument “would turn everything that we’ve done heretofore upside down.”
“I find it really disheartening that the legislature comes before us now and makes this type of claim after years and years of an understanding of in what way the Freedom of Information Act applies to legislators, individually, and the legislature as a whole,” Murphy said.
Holzman said the legislature had no right to make public documents protected by the speech or debate privilege, even if the legislature never asserted the privilege previously.
“It’s just not relevant,” Holzman said. “Even if that’s what they wanted, even if they said that with explicit language in FOIA, which they haven’t, it still wouldn’t matter. Because that would just be an example of a statute abrogating a constitutional protection.”
Holzman did not say why the privilege was being asserted now.
Stephen Fuzesi Jr., a former chief counsel of Newsweek appointed to the commission by Gov. Ned Lamont in 2019, pressed him, asking who made the call to assert the broad privilege. 
“It has been a fascinating intellectual argument. I’m just trying to figure out, is there some policy motivation behind it?” Fuzesi asked. “Who is the client?”
“My client here is an office of the General Assembly. It’s the Office of Legislative Management, but I work with others within the General Assembly who know about the case,” Holzman said. He did not name names.
In the appeal to the Superior Court, Holzman repeated what he told the commission: “FOIA does not permit the Commission to violate the Connecticut constitution, nor does FOIA waive or abrogate common law privileges and immunities.”
Smarra had argued successfully to the commission in October that Holzman was wrong on case law. The speech or debate clause has been broadly interpreted, but not in cases exempting documents from public-records laws.
“Nothing in the available jurisprudence suggests the ‘legislative privilege’ functions as a constitutional carve out from a public records statute such as the Connecticut FOI Act,’ he said in the recommended decision adopted by the FOI Commission.
Smarra also wrote the separation of powers argument — that the speech or debate clause is intended to prevent intimidation of lawmakers by the other branches of government — is misplaced.
“Specifically, the FOI Act cannot be used by the executive or judicial branches as a means of intimidation, as the Act affords rights solely to the public,” Smarra wrote.
There is a legislative management committee co-chaired by Looney and Ritter, the two top leaders of the Assembly. Ritter was uncertain if it should have been consulted by Tong’s office.
The committee has not met since Jan. 14, 2019.
While Ritter does not agree with the expansive view of legislative privilege asserted by Tong’s office, he said the questions raised about legislative privilege and “legitimate legislative activities” might be in the right venue.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma City Public Schools Superintendent Jamie Polk will receive a multi-year contract extension and a $25,000 salary increase, but a district school board member suggested she deserved more.
The Oklahoma City Board of Education voted unanimously Monday evening to approve Polk’s new contract, which would keep her in charge of the district through the 2028-29 school year. Her yearly base salary will increase to $275,000, but further contract details weren’t immediately made available after the board meeting.
The board’s vote follows weeks of growing complaints that Polk hadn’t yet received a new contract with a pay raise. Tulsa Public Schools, the state’s largest district, four days ago boosted the base salary of its superintendent, Ebony Johnson, to $290,000 and extended her contract by three years.
The Oklahoma City district, the state’s second-largest by only a few thousand students, “could have done better tonight,” board member Mike Shelton said before voting in favor of Polk’s extension.
“Oklahoma City Public Schools can do better at making sure that we not only pay fairly, pay our superintendent for the work that’s done but also all our employees,” Shelton said during the meeting. “We could have done better at making sure that we secured our superintendent at better equal pay.”

Polk, a first-time superintendent, was hired in May 2024 at a $250,000 base salary and $343,198 in total compensation. Her contract at the time was set to end June 30, 2027. It included insurance benefits, a vehicle, a $10,000 technology and vehicle stipend, and the possibility of an annual performance bonus worth up to 10% of her salary.
Polk was the seventh-highest paid superintendent in the state last school year, according to Oklahoma State Department of Education records. Yukon Public Schools Superintendent Jason Simeroth, now retired, was the highest paid with $437,217 in total compensation, followed by Norman Public Schools Superintendent Nick Migliorino at $412,016.
Dozens attended the Oklahoma City school board’s Nov. 10 meeting as the Rev. Derrick A. Scobey spoke in public comment to question why negotiations for Polk’s new contract had “stalled.”
Scobey, a prominent community leader and the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, pointed to an open superintendent position in Des Moines Public Schools in Polk’s home state of Iowa. Des Moines’ superintendent, Ian Roberts, resigned in September after Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested him.
“We’re in danger of losing our superintendent for her to go home because she has no contract in place,” Scobey said during the Nov. 10 meeting.

Polk declined to speak with news reporters after the board approved her new contract, but in a statement through her communications staff, she said she is “fully committed to the work ahead” in Oklahoma City schools.
“I am honored to continue serving as superintendent of Oklahoma City Public Schools,” Polk said in her statement. “This contract extension reflects our collective belief that stability, clarity and collaboration are essential to sustaining the progress our students deserve.”
The $25,000 salary increase will apply to the current fiscal year, and the contract extension through June 30, 2029, is the “maximum term allowed by law,” board Chairperson Paula Lewis said in a statement.
“We are pleased to have concluded these negotiations,” Lewis stated. “The board remains fully supportive of Dr. Polk and is deeply grateful for her steadfast leadership and service to our students, staff and community.”

The Winooski School District is calling for the rapid release of a second-grade student who was allegedly detained, with his mother, by federal immigration agents during the Thanksgiving break last week.
“They were traveling out of state, they made a wrong turn and were stopped and taken into ICE custody,” said Superintendent Wilmer Chavarria, who has since received information they are being held in a detention facility in Texas.
“We’ve had caregivers be detained and deported here in Winooski but we’ve never had one of our children be taken into custody by ICE,” he said Monday. 
The most diverse school district in an otherwise predominantly white state, Winooski was the first in Vermont to pass a sanctuary school policy earlier this year to protect students and families from the impact of federal immigration enforcement actions.
Chavarria, an outspoken advocate for families there, said, “We know that there have been cases where the mother and the child are separated intentionally — and this would be the worst-case scenario. So we’re trying to get help as quickly as we can.”
That’s difficult to do, however, given the shortage of legal assistance in Vermont at a time when the Trump administration has amplified efforts to detain and deport immigrants. And the system is so overwhelmed that it allows federal authorities to “simply get away with disappearing a family,” Chavarria said.

“My team has had a hard time trying to find legal aid for these people,” Chavarria said. 
Winooski has a rapid response system in place via which volunteers learned the mother and son were stopped and detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week. They located them Monday at a detention facility in Texas, spoke briefly with the mother over the phone and provided $1,000 in emergency relocation support from a private fund to the child’s father, who remained at home in Winooski, according to Chavarria.
The 7-year-old boy who attends JFK Elementary was absent from school Monday morning. A teacher said she called his home to make sure he knew school was back in session after the holiday. That’s when she learned from the father that he has not been able to contact the boy and his mother since Thursday.
They were pulled over, likely in Illinois, while driving to Minneapolis during the holiday last week. “And he tells us that over the weekend he’s been just desperately trying to figure out where his wife and child are,” Chavarria said.
Will Lambek, an organizer with Migrant Justice, denounced the detention and commended the school district’s response to it. 
“Since the start of the Trump administration, ICE and Border Patrol’s attacks against our community have exploded, with detentions in the state increasing more than tenfold,” he wrote in an email, adding, “Winooski is a model for how institutions in Vermont can respond to these unconscionable attacks.”
The Spanish-speaking family born in Ecuador recently moved to Winooski from Minneapolis. Chavarria said many of the district’s newer families came to the city because of its safe, inclusive environment to find “some sort of refuge here.”
“We’re trying to be as helpful as we can and we don’t expect this to be the outcome,” he said, adding that the district has been cautioning families to be extra vigilant in the current climate. “We are in dangerous times and we cannot live our lives as we usually would.”
The school district declined to identify the family. ICE did not immediately respond to comment.
“Our 2nd grader should be in his classroom, not in a detention cell,” Chavarria wrote on social media.
Chavarria, a U.S. citizen, was himself detained and interrogated by federal authorities in Texas for more than five hours while traveling back to Vermont after visiting family in Nicaragua in July.
He posted a message on the district’s social media page Monday afternoon strongly condemning the incident, calling for the Winooski family’s immediate release and for the federal government to bring back “basic humanity and due process.”
“This is yet another example of the terror our families face simply by doing things other people take for granted — going to school, shopping for groceries, or just visiting family,” he wrote.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s top state budget official is urging a close look at cash balances in some school districts as the governor and lawmakers consider ideas for property tax relief during the legislative session that begins next month.
Jim Terwilliger is the commissioner of the Bureau of Finance and Management and a member of the School Finance Accountability Board. He said the board should not condone excess school cash balances at a time when homeowners are complaining about high property taxes.
“When you start seeing a $600,000 excess balance, it begs the question, what are you doing?” Terwilliger said during a Nov. 12 board meeting. 
Lower spending, higher sales tax, revenue shifts: A closer look at 19 ways to reduce property taxes

The topic arose when leaders from six public school districts appeared before the board. The districts were required to appear because their reserves during the 2025 fiscal year exceeded limits in state law.
Reserves are calculated by dividing each district’s lowest monthly cash balance by its total general fund spending. The maximum allowable reserves are 40% for schools with enrollment of 200 or less, 30% for those with enrollment between 200 and 600, and 25% for those with enrollment of 600 or more.
When districts exceed the limits, the state board can recommend a full or partial waiver, a financial penalty or a financial review of the district by the state Department of Education. The recommendations go to the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee.
Earlier this month, Terwilliger asked the accountability board to take its duty seriously.
“I don’t want this board to be looked at as more of a rubber stamp of waivers,” he said.
The board ultimately recommended denial of one waiver and a financial review of that district, while recommending three full waivers and another two partial waivers with financial penalties.
The legislative committee on Monday approved the denied waiver and financial review; approved two of the full waivers; suggested making one of the full waivers contingent on a financial review; and suggested waiving the two financial penalties. The committee’s proposed changes now go back to the board.
School funding, property taxes discussed
Under the state’s school funding formula, each district’s funding need is calculated based on factors including enrollment, target teacher pay, benefits and overhead. Local funding sources known as the “local effort,” including property taxes, are applied toward that need first, and state funding (which comes primarily from the state sales tax) fills any remaining gap.
If a district’s local effort fulfills its need, the district receives no general state aid. That situation applied to four of the six districts that exceeded their allowable cash balances during the 2025 fiscal year: Agar-Blunt-Onida, Hoven, Hill City and Lead-Deadwood.
School superintendents urge lawmakers to tread carefully with property tax reform

It’s reasonable, Terwilliger said earlier this month, to ask whether property taxpayers in those four districts are overburdened.
Local effort during the 2025 fiscal year exceeded the calculated need by about $1.1 million in Agar-Blunt-Onida, about $588,000 in Hill City,  about $676,000 in Hoven, and about $4.3 million in Lead-Deadwood.
Because those school districts don’t receive state aid, the board was not able to financially penalize them. 
Rep. Liz May, R-Kyle, worried at Monday’s meeting that a lack of financial penalties for those school districts will mean they won’t be held accountable.
“That doesn’t help the people back home that are paying the taxes,” May said.
Along with May, other lawmakers echoed Terwilliger’s concern at the Monday meeting, asking about factors affecting property taxes, including school spending and saving.
Financial reviews for Hoven, Agar-Blunt-Onida
Officials from Agar-Blunt-Onida told the board last month that a decision to close Blunt Elementary at the end of the 2023-24 school year reduced expenses and drove up cash balances, while an increase in rural electric generation tax revenue also pushed cash balances higher than expected. The additional cash will help launch expanded career and technical education and possibly junior kindergarten or preschool in the coming years, and district officials said they’re prepared to lower the general fund property tax levy if revenue remains strong.
The School Finance Accountability Board recommended a full waiver for Agar-Blunt-Onida. The Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee rejected the recommendation, suggesting the board recommend a financial review of the school district.
Lawmakers suggested the review partly because the school district has appeared before the accountability board four times in five years.

A financial accountability review allows the state Department of Education to monitor the district more closely, Director of Finance and Management Cody Stoeser told lawmakers on Monday. The district and department create an in-depth correction plan to spend the excess funds and meet the state requirements. If school districts don’t comply, then they risk losing their accreditation, which can impact federal funding or sports programming. 
“We can’t go ahead and tell them how to spend their money,” Stoeser said. “We just go in there and make sure they’re going to comply with the requirement.”
The board will meet within 30 days to consider the legislative committee’s action.
Lawmakers approved the state board’s denial of the Hoven School District’s waiver request and the board’s recommendation that the state Education Department complete a financial review of the district. Hoven has appeared before the board four times in five years as well.
Officials from Hoven said their higher cash balance reflected the realities of operating a small district that does not receive general state aid. They said the district needs a larger reserve to weather swings in property valuations and enrollment, because it lacks a state backstop if revenues fall short. 
Waivers approved
Hill City officials said they became newly eligible for a federal grant and received two years’ worth of funding in a single fiscal year.
Lead-Deadwood officials said they had an unfilled teaching position during the school year that resulted in less expenses and higher cash balances. They also said their food service fund is not self-sufficient, so they supplement it with general funds, and they will adjust the timing of that transfer to the beginning of the year rather than the end to better manage cash balances. Additionally, monthly state funding for the Box Elder Job Corps influenced cash balances, even though the district merely acts as a pass-through for the funding. 
The state board recommended a full waiver for Hill City and Lead-Deadwood, which the legislative committee approved.
Lawmakers disagree with financial penalties
The two districts that exceeded allowable cash balances while receiving general state aid were Frederick Area and Miller.
Leaders from Frederick Area said their overage was a timing issue caused by delayed startup costs for an agricultural career and technical education program and higher-than-expected interest earnings. 
The accountability board recommended a partial waiver for Frederick Area and a fiscal penalty of 10% of the excess amount, which would result in a reduction of $9,265 in general state aid for the 2026 fiscal year.

Miller officials said their overage was tied to their recovery from a fire, infrastructure upgrades, staffing vacancies and revenue sources that were difficult to forecast. They said insurance proceeds and more efficient equipment lowered utility and maintenance costs, which in turn reduced expenses and pushed cash balances higher.
The accountability board recommended a partial waiver for Miller and a fiscal penalty of 10% of the excess amount, which would result in a reduction of $7,474 in general state aid for the 2026 fiscal year. 
Lawmakers voted to reject the penalties for both districts, in part because this year was their first appearance before the board in the last five years. The actions go back to the board, which will have 30 days to consider them.
School Finance Accountability Board Chairman Eric Stroeder told lawmakers that board members made the 10% penalty recommendations because they “want the board to mean something.”
“At some point,” Stroeder said, “it has to be done just to enforce the law.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/591A1601e-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 20:58:29.149916

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)An outside review of Charlie Kirk’s assassination at Utah Valley University and the school’s security protocols is expected to begin in January and conclude before summer 2026.  
The Orem university laid out the timeline in a request for proposals posted last month on its procurement website for contract vendors. UVU had announced in September that it was “initiating a comprehensive independent review with an external organization” but didn’t give a timeline or disclose the name of any firm. 
UVU starts independent security review after the assassination of Charlie Kirk

A spokesperson did not immediately provide answers to questions from Utah News Dispatch Monday. The college of more than 46,000 students in Orem — the state’s largest — is accepting bids from would-be reviewers until Wednesday. 
The development comes as the shooting of Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and close ally of President Donald Trump, has also drawn new focus to security protocols and police resources on college campuses across the state. 
While the university’s request for bids doesn’t explicitly mention Kirk or reference a shooting, it says the purpose of the probe is to analyze what happened before and after an incident on Sept. 10, “including contributing factors.” Evaluators will also scrutinize the university’s “security and emergency preparation and response actions and protocols” and make recommendations for improvement, according to the 22-page call for proposals.
Kirk was shot from a roof on campus while answering a student’s question in a courtyard, killing him. Security experts have said UVU seemed to miss important security steps such as monitoring rooftops and criticized the school for not staffing the event with more police officers. 
UVU Police Chief Jeffrey Long said just after the shooting that six officers worked the event, in addition to Kirk’s private security team of eight. 
The university announced last month it was in the process of hiring eight new campus police officers and two new safety managers to its existing force of 23 officers.

The coming review is set to begin in the first week of January and end sometime in late spring 2026, and will include a report prepared for the public. Evaluators are expected to conduct interviews with university leaders, law enforcement, emergency management workers, employees and students, the document says. 
They’re also tasked with looking over video, emergency plans, training records, incident logs and other relevant records that will help them piece together a timeline “and identify key decision points.”   
Also under the microscope is the university’s coordination with outside agencies like local law enforcement and emergency services. The Utah County Sheriff’s Office has said it was not involved that day until the shooting happened.  
Reflecting on campus safety throughout the state, Gov. Spencer Cox told reporters last week that “we want to make sure we have the funding necessary to keep our kids safe on campus.”
Asked whether he’d push for the state to free up funds for public universities to expand police forces, Cox replied, “We’re having that conversation with the department of public safety and all of our colleges and universities. We want our students to be safe. I’ve got kids on college campuses right now. It’s important to all of us.”
He noted UVU is the state’s largest university in terms of student enrollment, but said its campus is more compact than most, saying that’s a factor in the size of its police force. 
A newly formed state task force on higher education and public safety includes officials from Utah universities, law enforcement agencies and private businesses. 
Its members are set to convene for their first meeting on Dec. 8, Katie Mazzie with the Utah System of Higher Education told lawmakers on a school safety panel at the Capitol Monday. 
The task force plans to start by evaluating policies across Utah’s public colleges, Mazzie said, with the eventual goal of standardizing practices to make campuses safer.

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — In 2024, Aberdeen’s DemKota beef processing plant bought cattle from 400 producers. 
This year, they bought from 300.
“That wasn’t because we chose to,” CEO Adam Bode told the Sioux Falls Downtown Rotary Club on Monday. 
It’s because the producers aren’t there any longer. Raising or feeding cattle is “a great business and an even better lifestyle,” said Bode, but it’s one fewer and fewer people — particularly young people — can afford to get into. He said the average age of a South Dakota cattle producer is 63.
In South Dakota, the Governor’s Office of Economic Development facilitates loans to beginning farmers and ranchers, but only for a handful of people each year. Since 2019, the office’s board approved a total of $4.6 million in bonds for 13 applicants statewide, an average of about $354,000 per award.
Bode sees plenty of opportunity in cattle, but others need to see the same.
“To the bankers in the room: Loan that money to that young producer,” Bode said. “It is a high capital business to get started. That’s the biggest hurdle to get new players in it, and we desperately need them.”
Volatility embedded in business
Dave Geraets, who has 2,500 head of cattle and grows row crops outside of Colton, said the cattle side of the business is wildly volatile. Diversified operations can help producers weather price fluctuations — particularly when corn prices are high, Geraets said — but adding cropland only makes it harder to start from scratch.
“No matter if it’s land or cattle, all of it is expensive,” said Geraets, who hopes to see his kids stay involved in the business.
American ranchers hit with ‘gut punch’ as Trump follows through on Argentina beef import pledge

This year, the wild price swings for cattle have been historic. A low inventory pushed prices to an all-time high in August. 
The prices didn’t last. Citing a desire to lower beef prices for consumers, President Donald Trump announced his intention to push for the importation of more beef from Argentina this fall by increasing the number of tariff-free metric tons each year from 20,000 to 80,000.
“We retracted that market by 25% in two weeks,” said Ryan Eichler, founder and board president for the South Dakota Cattlemen’s Foundation. “Imagine the stock market retracting 25% in two weeks.”
Craig Bieber, vice president of the South Dakota Cattlemen’s Association, told South Dakota Searchlight last month that the Argentina move was “a gut punch.” U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, met with the Trump team last month to discuss the concerns of ranchers. 
Trump would later ask his departments of Justice and Agriculture to launch an investigation into “hyperconsolidation” of the beef packing industry. The investigation would look into the “big four” packers – JBS, Cargill, Tyson and National Beef – “for potential collusion, price fixing and price manipulation.”
Capital access hinders smaller operations
Bode, the DemKota CEO, said his company slaughters about 300,000 cattle a year, and tries to stand out by processing higher-end cuts of meat. When asked by Rotarian and former Gov. Dennis Daugaard what it would take to process more, Bode said capital investment.
Much like a young farmer, he said, the price of entry for a processor is high enough to make financing difficult. 
South Dakota program offers aspiring farmers a rare path into agriculture

“We have an internal joke in our industry: If you ever want to make a couple million bucks in beef processing, just start with a couple billion,” Bode said.
The large beef packers aren’t immune to volatility, either, Bode told South Dakota Searchlight after the discussion. The same low inventory that pushed prices to record levels has made it harder for the Big Four packers to keep their processing plants up and running. 
Last month, Tyson announced the closure of its Lexington, Nebraska plant, which has the capacity to process 5,000 cattle a day but had recently been processing around 3,600 a day.
The closure won’t have an impact on DemKota, which is a smaller-scale operator, Bode said.
But it does show that the bigger players are having the same problem he is: too few producers raising too few cattle to meet high demand.
“There still aren’t enough animals,” he said. “Even with that giant plant, there’ll be another plant closure. It’s the first of several, really, in our opinion.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PXL_20251201_185032594-scaled-e1764635853520-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-01 19:57:54.045325

A North Carolina political race that has been brewing for years became official Monday, with Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page filing to run against Senate Leader Phil Berger in the Republican primary in the district that includes Rockingham and part of Guilford. 
Candidate filing started Monday. When it ends at noon on Dec. 19, it’ll be clear where primary elections will be and who will glide into office unopposed next year. 
The conflict between Berger and Page burst into public view with Berger’s support in 2023 for expanding casino gambling in the state — and building one in Rockingham County. Berger has since called that proposal dead, but that hasn’t dulled the sharp accusations the two campaigns have traded this year. 
Berger was elected to the state Senate in 2000. He is in his eighth term as Senate leader — formally Senate president pro tem  — and is one of the most powerful politicians in the state. No other candidates had filed to run in Senate District 26 by Monday afternoon.
A Democratic primary that produced one of the closest results in the state in 2024 is headed for a rematch. Longtime former Rep. Michael Wray is challenging the current occupant of the NC House District 27 seat, freshman Rep. Rodney Pierce. In 2024, Pierce defeated Wray in the district that includes Halifax, Warren, and Northampton counties by 34 votes, or less than a percentage point. Pierce went on to run unopposed in the general election. 
In Guilford County, Angie Williams-McMichael of High Point is running against Rep. Amanda Cook in the Democratic primary in House District 50. Cook was appointed to the seat a few weeks ago to replace former House member Cecil Brockman. Brockman resigned after being charged with sex crimes involving a minor, charges he has denied..

 Who will run in the new 1st Congressional District? Davis, Hanig are in

Republicans are aiming to turn the northwest 1st U.S. House District red in 2026, thanks to a new congressional map approved by the legislature and upheld by a federal court. 
Which Republican will vie for that seat? That remains to be seen.
Its current occupant, Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis, said Monday he would run in the redrawn district despite new boundaries that strongly favor a Republican. Davis no longer lives in the district — he was drawn out of it by Republican map-makers and now resides in the neighboring 3rd district. But members of Congress are not required to live in a district to represent it.
“Many feel Washington, D.C. isn’t serving their needs, and the redistricting battle clearly proves it,” Davis wrote on social media Monday.
On the other side of the aisle, a contested primary is likely. Just one candidate has filed for the seat as of Monday: state Sen. Bobby Hanig, a Republican who has emerged as a rare dissenting GOP voice in the Senate on issues like a ban on shrimp trawling.
“I’ve always been very vocal when it comes to people coming after folks in my district,” Hanig told reporters. “People bring me to Raleigh to defend them and make sure that we’re taking care of them.”
Will President Donald Trump weigh in on the GOP primary? “We’ll see,” said U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson, who heads the national campaign arm to elect House Republicans. 
“We’ll stay in contact as candidates emerge in the 1st district, and we’ll see,” he said. “He may decide not to endorse, he may endorse.”
Hudson has also drawn an early official opponent — Democrat Nigel Bristow, who serves as chief probation and patrol officer in Anson County, filed for the 9th district on Monday.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill announced Monday that running mate and Lt. Gov.-elect Dale Caldwell will serve as secretary of state when the two take office next month.
Sherrill, a Democrat, told reporters that Caldwell had been vying for the job since their first meeting during her campaign to become governor. The two appeared Monday at Delia’s, a restaurant in Caldwell’s hometown of New Brunswick.
“He served in state government before and knew that, given his background, as he sometimes says, in bringing together small actors in the community, small businesses, small churches, small nonprofits, that he really felt there was an opportunity in the state department,” Sherrill said.
Caldwell is the first person to be named to Sherrill’s cabinet.
In New Jersey, the lieutenant governor also serves as the head of a department, and two of Caldwell’s lieutenant governor predecessors have also served as secretary of state. Caldwell will be New Jersey’s fourth lieutenant governor when he takes office Jan. 20.
The secretary of state oversees state government offices supporting New Jersey’s arts, history, and business communities, in addition to overseeing state elections.
Caldwell said he would enhance transparency in elections by ordering votes counted faster, addressing intimidation at polling sites, and allowing people to quickly challenge contested votes in front of judges. 
Caldwell previously served as a deputy commissioner at the Department of Community Affairs. Most recently, he was president of Centenary University in Hackettstown and also served on the New Brunswick school board for over 25 years.
On the campaign trail and on Monday, he invoked his father, the late Rev. Gilbert Caldwell, who marched with Martin Luther King Jr.
“This is a time when we have an assault from an administration on trying to do everything they can, and so often unconstitutionally, to really interrupt our election process,” Caldwell said.
He joined the Sherrill campaign in July and now also co-chairs her transition team. 
Sherrill said Caldwell will work on improving business development and tourism in New Jersey. He’ll cut “red tape” for the state’s businesses and ensure New Jersey is prepared for the World Cup in 2026, he added.
“You are going to see some really interesting things happening in the Department of State, from a community-up level, so it’s kind of exciting,” Caldwell said.

Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (2024 file photo)Some Georgia lawmakers want to use state resources to keep drones from dropping off contraband like drugs and cell phones at detention facilities.
Matthew Wolfe, director of the Office of Professional Standards within the Georgia Department of Corrections, said a months-long investigation that led to the arrest of 150 suspects drove down drone activity last year, with only 15 drone incidents reported last December, but Wolfe told the House Appropriations Committee on Public Safety Monday that incidents have increased steadily this year, reaching 63 in November.
Despite the illegality, flying contraband into detention facilities can be a lucrative business, said Georgia Department of Corrections Commissioner Tyrone Oliver, and inmates are often willing to clamber up pipes to access the roof to retrieve the illicit packages.
“Some of it is dropping on the yard. The majority of them are dropping on the ceiling,” he said. “So what you have, when you’re talking about our aging infrastructure, most of the prisons that were built, they have internal pipe chases inside the dorm, inside the dormitory themselves. The inmates are able to get inside the pipe chase, access the roof, which is the metal roof, push it up, get the contraband, come back in.”
When prison officials spot a drone, the first thing they do is call local law enforcement, Wolfe said.
“That local law enforcement starts patrolling looking for a vehicle or suspicious people in the area. My canine team is also dispatched to the location in case there’s something in the woods that needs to be tracked. That’s the normal protocol.”
But the protocol does not include knocking drones out of the sky, whether by shooting it or jamming its communications. Oliver said that’s because Washington has tied their hands.
“When we talk about mitigation, especially when it comes to drones, federal law prohibits us from interfering with that unmanned aircraft,” he said. “So, even if it’s flying to where I can reach it, ceiling high, I can’t touch it.”
“I might as well just go ahead and go to Hartsfield Jackson and interfere with a Delta jet going across the sky, it’s the same penalties,” he added.
Cochran Republican state Rep. Danny Mathis was incredulous.
“You’re telling me that you don’t have the legal authority if you have a restricted area like a prison, and that drone flies in that restricted area, you don’t have the authority to stop it?”
“That’s correct,” Oliver said.
“That needs to be changed,” Mathis said. “That just makes no sense.”
Oliver said he has been lobbying the Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Communications Commission and members of Congress for change at the federal level and expressed optimism that a resolution could be coming soon.
The state Legislature can’t overrule federal laws, but Mathis suggested the state government could pitch in dollars to help counties offset spending on prosecuting drone-related crimes.
“Some of them are very poor counties and they can’t afford to do this,” he said. “So the state has got to step up, in my opinion, to help these counties offset some of this.”
Hartwell Republican state Rep. Alan Powell suggested skipping the middleman in the state’s lobbying efforts and petitioning President Donald Trump directly.
“Water runs downhill and it runs from the White House,” Powell said. “We have a system of government that’s being run off of executive orders today, which is scary to me at the least. But it seems to me like probably the best thing the legislators can do in the various states would be to send the president an appeal to let him deal with the federal aviation and things like that and move forward.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/DSC0329-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-01 19:57:54.045325

“People are literally going to go hungry,” said Amelia Vath, an advisor to Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark, adding that her team believes “we are very likely to win this case.”

Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark joined a multistate lawsuit against the Trump administration last week over an Oct. 31 federal memo that mandated new food assistance restrictions for noncitizens. 
The move came after Clark signed a joint letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture last month, criticizing both the new rules and the department’s manner of delivering them. 
The lawsuit alleges that the mandates incorrectly deny a number of groups, including some refugees and other humanitarian entrants, access to the USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Not only did certain changes contradict federal law, Clark and her colleagues argued in the suit, but language in the memo created confusion, and set unreasonable deadlines for implementation.
While the bulk of recent cuts to 3SquaresVT, Vermont’s version of SNAP, will remain unchallenged, the lawsuit could see benefits return to dozens of noncitizen households across the state.
On Monday, Vermont cut off or reduced food aid to a new group of roughly 22 noncitizen households — per an estimate from the Department for Children and Families — in order to comply with the federal guidance in question. Refugees and asylees, who previously qualified for the program if they held green cards, are now subject to a five-year waiting period, which Clark and her colleagues dispute.
In the raft of changes that Vermont had previously made to the program this year, a group of largely Afghan immigrants who assisted the U.S. military in their home country also lost eligibility. Last week’s suit challenges that restriction as well, which the October memo appeared to confirm. 
The lawsuit, joined by Clark and officials in 20 states and the District of Columbia, seeks a preliminary injunction from a federal judge in Oregon that would allow states to quickly reinstate lost benefits where appropriate. The case is scheduled for oral arguments on Dec. 15.
“People are literally going to go hungry,” said Amelia Vath, an advisor to Clark, in an emailed statement Monday, adding that her team believes “we are very likely to win this case.” 
Vermont’s Attorney General has said in recent weeks that while she disagrees with parts of the USDA’s guidance, leaders in Gov. Phil Scott’s administration have done what they feel they must in implementing new rules.
“The Trump Administration is failing the most vulnerable people, leaving states in the impossible position of trying to comply with confusing and incredibly poorly timed guidance, all while fearful of massive penalties that could be held against us for errors,” Clark said in a release last week.
July’s federal budget law outlined significant consequences for states that carried out the new food assistance changes incorrectly. Officials have projected that a small increase in Vermont’s “error rate” could incur a loss of nearly $8 million in federal funds.
Tracy Dolan, director of the state’s Refugee Office, said she could not comment on Clark’s suit, but said more generally in an emailed statement that “any changes in federal policy that would provide SNAP to non-citizens who were previously eligible would be welcome.” 
“Even with full time work, some refugee families like other Vermonters are finding it hard to make ends meet due to high food costs, high housing costs and low wages,” Dolan said.

Christine Chandler.","New Mexico lawmakers speak Monday, Dec. 1, 2025, at Central New Mexico Community College about state-level artificial intelligence regulation. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)A handful of New Mexico lawmakers described their plans for the upcoming legislative session during a summit Monday focused on artificial intelligence, which states increasingly find themselves trying to regulate amid a permissive federal environment. 
New Mexico Reps. Christine Chandler (D-Los Alamos) and Linda Serrato (D-Santa Fe) moderated a panel conversation in Albuquerque, featuring a national expert with the National Conference of State Legislatures and a state lawmaker from Virginia. 
They all described a difficult and changing landscape for states that seek to, for example, crack down on discriminatory algorithms; prevent chatbots from sparking inappropriate relationships with children; or require artificial intelligence companies or their clients to disclose more with the public about their use of the technology. 
New Mexico’s AI future

The Virginia lawmaker, Michelle Lopes Maldonado, said her efforts at “comprehensive” AI reform at her statehouse failed due to there being “just too much gap between comfort levels, understanding, etc, to be able to move forward with more.” 
One challenge she and other state lawmakers have faced is in defining “artificial intelligence” in legislation, she said. 
“I don’t believe that any of the states have a definition for AI. There really isn’t one quite sufficient yet, because the technology is growing so rapidly,” she said. 
In the meantime, she recommended New Mexico lawmakers use a definition for “AI system” that the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international organization of 38 developed economies, has developed. 
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 38 states adopted 100 pieces of AI-related legislation in 2025. But Chelsea Canada, who advises states on AI regulations for the organization, said Monday that few states have adopted comprehensive legislation that tackles consumer protection or data privacy concerns. And, in some cases, governors have vetoed those bills, she said.  
As AI takes the helm of decision making, signs of perpetuating historic biases emerge

Instead of more ambitious proposals, states have increasingly focused more on “narrow” protections, like the 10 states that adopted AI regulations governing the healthcare industry in 2025, Canada said. 
Chandler told Source New Mexico after the panel that she intends to reintroduce a pared-down version of House Bill 60 during the upcoming legislative session. That bill, which died in the House, contained 15 different sections aimed at “developers and deployers” of AI, including transparency and anti-discrimination requirements. 
“That was a big algorithm bill, and the forces were out and about to try to squash that,” she said, adding later that she was referring to “Big Tech.” During the next legislative session she said she intends to focus more narrowly on transparency measures, including ensuring users know when they’re communicating with AI chatbots.
“At a minimum, people need to be reminded that they’re interacting — especially young people — with a machine and not a human,” she said. 
Looming over any state-level AI regulation is the possibility that the federal government will ban states from imposing rules on companies or their clients. President Donald Trump recently drafted an executive order that would punish states that enact their own AI regulations. 
“I’ve been told that [AI companies] are continuing to push” Trump to prohibit states from regulating AI, Chandler said. “And the President is very amenable.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3221-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-01 18:58:51.562637

During the holiday weekend, the Montana Department of Health and Human Services announced plans to construct a new behavioral health facility near Laurel. 
During the 2025 legislative session, a long-range planning bill set aside $26.5 million for the 32-bed forensic mental health facility. 
“We are grateful to the City of Laurel and its leaders for their interest in partnering with the state on a new behavioral health facility,” DPHHS Director Charlie Brereton said in a statement. “Laurel provides access to a critical health care workforce and infrastructure necessary to ensure the facility’s success. Furthermore, Laurel’s geographic location is ideally situated for improving transportation logistics for patients and their families, staff, and law enforcement across central and eastern Montana.”
The location announcement came after a brief pause by the Board of Investments, which will oversee construction of the facility, as the Board sought guidance on the location and services desired for the facility. The Board of Investments will own the facility as a state investment, with plans to lease it to DPHHS. 
In the announcement, DPHHS said that Laurel was selected because it “provides access to a critical health care workforce and infrastructure necessary to ensure the facility’s success,” and the geographic location helps with transportation logistics for patients and their families, staff and law enforcement across the eastern portion of the state. 
“As many Montanans know, DPHHS has experienced surging demand for forensic psychiatric services over the past several years, resulting in a problematic statewide waitlist that adversely impacts local communities,” Brereton said in a letter announcing the site selection on Nov. 26. “While DPHHS has taken a variety of steps to try to address this issue operationally, its bed capacity remains severely limited, and the agency believes that the funds granted to us by the Legislature must be prioritized for the forensic population.” 
Despite the announcement by the state, there is no actual location determined for the new facility. 
The city of Laurel didn’t even submit an application for consideration. 
In a Nov. 17 letter sent by Laurel city officials, they said the city did not apply as a potential location because the suitable land they felt could accommodate the behavioral health facility isn’t located in city limits. 
Laurel Chief Administrative Officer Kurt Markegard wrote that along with Mayor David Waggoner, he had described to the Board of Investments a location just outside city limits that would “make building the facility remarkably successful.”
Markegard said city laws require land to be annexed before receiving city services and while that had prohibited the city council from applying as a potential location, the process for annexation could begin if the state chose the Laurel area as a final location. 
Laurel city officials did not respond to questions about the exact location they had proposed for the facility. 
Board of Investments executive director Dan Villa said in an email to the Daily Montanan that the search for a site is ongoing, but that a location near Laurel, but outside of city limits, would lead to a request for annexation by the city. 
While the legislature authorized funds through the BOI for the new facility it is unlikely the $26.5 million will be enough to construct a facility that meets the needs outlined by DPHHS. 
“It is anticipated that these funds may be insufficient to construct a “hardened” facility designed to safely and securely serve a forensic population,” Brereton wrote. 
Brereton added that the department is prepared to allocate additional funding from its Behavioral Health Systems for Future Generations special revenue account, which currently has nearly $42 million, to cover additional costs outside of the legislatively authorized funding. 
According to the state’s website for the project, Custer County and Big Horn County also submitted proposals to locate the new facility near Miles City and Hardin, respectively.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IMG-4965-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-01 18:58:51.562637

(Photo by Nadia Engenheiro, Half Street Group) Two Rhode Island nonprofits joined a federal lawsuit filed Monday by a coalition of municipal governments and nonprofit organizations challenging the Trump administration’s push to overhaul a key federal homelessness and housing grant program.
The 85-page lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island seeks to stop the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) from slashing the amount of grant funds that can be spent on permanent housing, or subsidized units that provide a stable residence for formerly homeless people, often those who have experienced mental illness or spent years on the streets. 
Lead plaintiffs include the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the National Low Income Housing Coalition, along with Providence-based nonprofits Crossroads Rhode Island and Youth Pride Inc. — among other groups and cities across the country.
The plaintiffs are challenging changes to HUD’s Continuum of Care grant program announced Nov. 13 that shift over two-thirds of the $3.9 billion program toward transitional housing and other short-term interventions for people without shelter. The lawsuit claims the new policy is contrary to “well-established and proven strategies that reduce homelessness” and jeopardize the housing of more than 170,000 people across the nation. 
The so-called “housing first” model prioritizes stable housing before offering case management, mental health treatment, substance use services, and supported employment services. Research has shown this approach leads to more long-term housing stability than programs that require residents to consent to treatment and abstain from using substances before receiving housing.
HUD’s new policy was announced a little over a month before the Dec. 12 deadline set for Rhode Island’s care operators to apply for the federal dollars, the lawsuit notes.
In federal fiscal year 2024, Crossroads Rhode Island, the largest homeless service provider in the state received four Continuum of Care grants totaling over $2.1 million — much of which goes toward subsidizing residents’ rents across the 375 permanent supportive housing units it operates across the state. 
The loss of federally-funded subsidies could mean the residents Crossroads serves would be responsible for paying 100% of the rental cost.
Crossroads claims that following the new federal rules would jeopardize the organization’s professional ethical standards and increase the potential that it could “face enormous risks of litigation and government inquiry.”
“Our goal is simple: to protect the programs that keep families and vulnerable individuals safely housed and ensure that permanent housing initiatives remain accessible in every state in America,” Michelle Wilcox, Crossroads’ CEO and president, said in a statement Monday. 
HUD’s new rules also prohibit future funds from being used to conduct activities that “rely on or otherwise use a definition of sex as other than binary in humans.” The lawsuit claims the policy violates the First Amendment and HUD’s own policy.
“HUD’s Equal Access Rule applies to CoC-funded programs and protects transgender individuals from discrimination,” the lawsuit states.
An ‘incomprehensible’ policy change
For Youth Pride, compliance with that rule would mean no longer using preferred names or chosen pronouns for the queer youth it serves at its Westminster Street headquarters in Providence. The group would also have to shut down its support programs for transgender and nonbinary youth and could be forced to terminate transgender and nonbinary staff or require them to hide their identities.
“Unhoused and housing-insecure youth are one of the most vulnerable populations in our communities,” Youth Pride Executive Director Rush Frazier said in a statement. “It’s incomprehensible that any administration can justify or endorse changes that leave young adults unhoused, diminishing their chances of completing college, finding long term housing, and risking their physical and mental health in the process.”
In federal fiscal year 2024, Youth Pride received a Continuum of Care grant of $183,260, according to the lawsuit.
Like all lawsuits filed against the Trump administration, attorneys for the coalition argue HUD’s new policy is “arbitrary and capricious” and claim the department violated the Administrative Procedure Act in the sudden issuance of a new notice of funding opportunity.
Because of those issues, the coalition is asking the court to declare the new conditions unlawful and reinstate language from prior funding notices. They’re the same demands being made by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, along with 18 other AGs and two governors, in a separate lawsuit filed Nov. 25. That case has been assigned to Judge Mary S. McElroy, who has not yet scheduled a hearing.
A HUD spokesperson did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Other plaintiffs in the suit filed Monday include the County of Santa Clara, Calif.; San Francisco; King County, Washington; Boston; Cambridge, Massachusetts; Nashville; and Tucson, Arizona.

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)A New Jersey Senate panel unanimously approved legislation Monday that would strip some investigatory powers and staff from the state’s comptroller over overwhelming opposition from activists, other watchdogs, and New Jersey’s chief law enforcement official.
Over nearly four hours of testimony in front of the Senate state government committee that included several shouting matches, a range of critics urged lawmakers not to advance legislation that would end the Office of the State Comptroller’s ability to issue subpoenas and launch investigations into waste, fraud, and abuse.
Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union), the bill’s chief sponsor, defended the measure at the start of the hearing and said criticism of it is overblown.
“This is a reallocation of small resources from one department to another which is more properly equipped to handle them,” Scutari said.
The bill would remove powers and duties the comptroller inherited from the state’s defunct inspector general’s office in 2010.
The proposed shift would eliminate the office’s duty to investigate complaints of governmental waste, fraud, and abuse flagged by members of the public and strip the comptroller of some investigatory tools.
The comptroller’s office would keep its authority to audit state and local governments and the state’s Medicaid program, though the bill would make it harder for it to obtain documents to aid those audits.
Though state law requires governments to share documents with the comptroller at the office’s request, the office has said some bodies — including joint health insurance funds with ties to South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross — have declined to turn over records.
The bill would shift the comptroller’s lost powers to the State Commission of Investigation, a body originally convened in 1968 to combat organized crime that has grown less relevant and less productive as New Jersey’s mobs weakened.
Bruce Keller, who was appointed as the commission’s executive director in July, argued during Monday’s hearing that his agency is better positioned to conduct investigations now overseen by the comptroller’s office.
“Investigations is 100% of the SCI’s work, and the SCI does it with former prosecutors and deeply experienced state and federally trained investigators, and we’re adding even more in the months ahead,” he said.
The legislation would grant the State Commission of Investigation an expanded mandate, allowing it to investigate misuses of taxpayer money as the comptroller does now. The bill would also allow it to investigate misconduct by law enforcement.
The latter provision, combined with another allowing the commission to seek approval for wiretaps, pushed New Jersey’s top law enforcement official to sound the alarm.
“The idea of wiretapping conducted by a civil enforcement agency never once came up to me, in my four years as an attorney general, as an idea we should even consider, much less one I should be testifying about before this body,” said Attorney General Matt Platkin.
Platkin added that he has significant concerns about the bill’s constitutionality, warning the provisions that would allow staff at the State Commission of Investigation — an agency overseen partly by the Legislature — to seek wiretaps or participate in prosecutions risk trampling on the separation of powers by allowing the Legislature to enforce laws, rather than draft them.
“What it does is it creates a rogue prosecution agency reportable to legislative leadership with an executive director — as great as Bruce Keller may be — the Legislature reaffirms can be fired at will with no notice,” said Platkin.

Few who testified Monday said they oppose making the State Commission of Investigation more robust, though almost universally, witnesses said changes should not come at the expense of the comptroller’s office.
Acting State Comptroller Kevin Walsh said his office is more productive, noting it had published 25 reports in 2025 to the commission’s zero.
“The reality is SCI can return to its glory days, and Mr. Keller may even be the one to do it, but it doesn’t need to come at the cost of undermining the executive branch’s watchdog when we have been more effective, more prolific, including in investigations,” Walsh said.
The comptroller’s falling out with legislators began in 2023 after the office released a report that Union County had improperly paid some of its top officials, and that conflict heated to a boiling point over the following two years.
Subsequent reports that found waste in Essex County’s COVID-19 vaccine program and procurement violations in Hudson County spurred calls from county officials to rein in the office with legislative hearings.
Some witnesses — including some of the state’s other oversight officials — suggested the bill is retaliation over the comptroller’s work.
“While it has been presented as if it were not an attack on one agency, it does appear to be an attack on one agency — not because it’s doing a bad job, but quite a good job, I think,” said Terry Schuster, New Jersey’s corrections ombudsman. “Independent oversight bodies have to be able to say the truth, even when it’s unpopular.”
State Sen. John Burzichelli (D-Burlington) said the bill was drafted because of dissatisfaction “with how things have been running” at the comptroller’s office, though neither he nor any other members of the committee named particular problems there.
Sen. Jim Beach (D-Camden), the committee’s chair, suggested the bill was spurred by discontent with Platkin’s performance as attorney general, though the bill does not affect Platkin’s office outside of allowing the commission to seek wiretap approval for employees of the Office of the Attorney General.

Beach, who chairs the Camden County Democratic Committee and is a close Norcross ally, imposed a strict three-minute time limit on testimony by most of the bill’s roughly three dozen opponents — including, at times, by cutting their microphones — but not its supporters.
Beach engaged in shouting matches with Walsh and also with U.S. Sen Andy Kim (D-NJ), who was among those to testify against the bill. Kim had asked to testify at the start of the hearing, but Beach would not allow him to speak until near the end, even when some witnesses whose names were called earlier said they would cede their time to Kim.
When Kim’s testimony surpassed the three-minute mark, Beach told him he had to conclude.
“Sir, I have been here for five-and-a-half hours,” Kim told Beach.
“Yeah, so what?” Beach responded. “So has everyone else. Why do you think you’re special? You’re not.”

The commission is considering a rate increase for Xcel Energy. (Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)Xcel Energy has agreed to cut a proposed electricity rate increase for North Dakota customers. 
The agreement that is pending approval with the North Dakota Public Service Commission would raise overall rates by 10.37%, with the increase for residential customers at 12.92%. 
Northern States Power Co., part of Minnesota-based Xcel Energy, had originally asked for a rate increase of 19.34% with the residential rate increasing by more than 24%.
A Public Service Commission hearing on Monday went over details of the rate request and the compromise agreement. 
North Dakota customers have already been paying a higher electric rate this year under an interim rate increase. Customers’ bills should not change dramatically if the rate increase is approved as currently proposed, said Victor Schock, director of utilities for the PSC.
A vote by the three-person commission could come in January. 
Xcel’s coal exit an issue in North Dakota electric rate case 

Xcel had not asked for a rate increase in four years, which a representative said was needed in part to address high inflation. The rate increase will also help pay for a new Grand Forks service center, a new substation and equipment upgrades.
Xcel has about 97,000 customers in North Dakota, including in Fargo, Grand Forks and Minot. 
During the hearing, Public Service Commissioner Sheri Haugen-Hoffart said in reviewing the 165 public comments, she noted four themes, which she asked Allen Krug, vice president of state regulatory policy, to address.
Data centers: Krug said the rate increase has nothing to do with data centers in North Dakota or Minnesota. Krug said Xcel was committed to not making existing customers pay for new large electric load projects such as data centers. 
Impact to seniors and those on fixed incomes: Haugen-Hoffart said those relying on Social Security cost-of-living increases feel the rate increase more than others. 
Krug said “no cost increase is without pain,” but noted the increase is less than the rate of inflation since the previous rate increase. 
Effect of Minnesota policies: Minnesota has been pushing utilities away from fossil fuels such as coal. Xcel is retiring coal-fired power plants in Minnesota earlier than North Dakota regulators anticipated. 
Krug said the rate increases are not driven by those policy differences between the two states. He said Xcel has made investments to ensure power reliability. 
He also said Xcel continues to use natural gas and said there is potential for a natural gas-powered plant in eastern North Dakota if a pipeline to bring natural gas from the state’s oilfields in the west is built.
Xcel profits: Krug said the company’s profits are in line with what investors request. 
The Public Service Commission had set aside the whole week for the hearing, but it wrapped up before noon Monday as a result of the compromise.

,DC,2025-12-01 23:22:00+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Arizona’s Kelly vows to stay outspoken despite threats over illegal order video,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/arizonas-kelly-vows-stay-outspoken-despite-threats-over-illegal-order-video,,"WASHINGTON — Arizona Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly said Monday the threat of a court-martial for a video he and other senators released telling military members not to follow illegal orders is an effort to silence the president’s political opponents. Kelly, a retired Navy captain, was one of six Democratic lawmakers with backgrounds in the military or intelligence agencies who appeared in the video that was posted on social media in mid-November. President Donald Trump alleged the lawmakers had committed “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” for telling members of the military and intelligence communities that they “can” and “must refuse illegal orders.”Kelly said during a press conference that he and his wife, former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived being shot during a town hall in 2011, have experienced a sharp increase in threats in the weeks since Trump reacted negatively to the video. “My family knows the cost of political violence. My wife, Gabby, was shot in the head and nearly died while speaking with her constituents,” Kelly said. “The president should understand this too. He has been the target of political violence himself.”Kelly then listed off other recent instances of political violence, including the killing of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, the arson at the official home of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk during a rally at Utah Valley University. “Every other president we have ever had in the history of this nation would have tried to heal the country,” Kelly said. “But we all know Donald Trump, he uses every single opportunity to divide us, and that's dangerous.”The Defense Department has announced officials are looking into recalling Kelly to active duty for a potential court-martial. The FBI has also contacted the House and Senate Sergeant at Arms to request interviews with the six lawmakers in the video. Kelly said he and the other Democrats in the video would not be intimidated or silenced by Trump’s comments or the investigations.“It's a dangerous moment for the United States of America when the president and his loyalists use every lever of power to silence United States senators for speaking up,” Kelly said. “But we all know that this isn't about me and it's not about the others in that video.“They're trying to send a message to retired service members, to government employees, the members of the military, to elected officials and to all Americans who are thinking about speaking up — you better keep your mouth shut, or else.”Video caused stirThe lawmakers’ video reminded servicemembers they’d sworn an oath to the Constitution, something Kelly said shouldn’t have been controversial. “No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution. We know this is hard and that it’s a difficult time to be a public servant,” the Democrats said in the video. “But whether you’re serving in the CIA, in the Army, or Navy, or the Air Force, your vigilance is critical.”Kelly declined to say directly during the press conference if the video was a response to ongoing strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea that Trump and others in the administration have said are shipping illegal substances to the United States. “I think it's good for people to get a reminder. And we wanted to show that we had their back and we understood the situation they were in,"" Kelly said. “And we said something that is in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, according to the law of armed combat.”Investigations openedThe House and Senate Armed Services Committees have each opened investigations into the strikes after The Washington Post reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to make sure everyone died during a Sept. 2 strike on one of the boats. Kelly said that he has “tremendous confidence” in committee Chairman Roger Wicker of Mississippi and ranking member Jack Reed of Rhode Island. But he repeatedly criticized Hegseth as unqualified, saying he often “runs around on a stage like he's a 12-year-old playing army.” “If there is anyone who needs to answer questions in public and under oath, it is Pete Hegseth,” Kelly said. The Armed Services Committee, he said, should have both a public hearing and one for senators in a classified setting to get more details on the strikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela, including whether the Trump administration has a strategy. Kelly said if Trump wants to remove Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, then he must make that clear so Congress can have a debate and Americans can have a say in a potential war.“Regime change as a policy in the United States, generally, in our history, has not worked out well. Think of South Vietnam, think of the Bay of Pigs, Iraq and Afghanistan. It results in the deaths of U.S. service members without the intended outcome,” Kelly said. “And in this case, I don't even think we know the intended outcome. The president needs to make a case to the American people when he is about to put thousands of American men and women in harm's way.”",,,,2025-12-01 18:58:51.562637

Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, introduced bipartisan legislation to streamline the process to recover missing U.S. military members. 
Crapo and U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, on Monday announced the re-introduction of the Bring Our Heroes Home Act. The senators also introduced the bill in 2023. 
“Idaho welcomed home another missing hero just a few weeks ago, and we cannot give up on our efforts to identify and bring home every remaining missing servicemember,” Crapo said in a press release. “We must cut the bureaucratic red tape that delays bringing them to an eternal resting place here at home. We owe their families and loved ones the assurances they have not been forgotten.” 
In mid-October, the remains of 2nd Lt. Charles Atteberry were returned his family in Parma after being missing for 80 years, KTVB reported. Atteberry was born in Parma and joined the Army in 1937. He was reported missing in 1942 and later reported as a prisoner by Japan in the Philippines until 1944, the Idaho Statesman reported. 
Atteberry was aboard a Japanese ship in January 1945 when it was attacked and sunk by U.S. forces. The Idaho native reportedly survived the attack but died a few days later at sea, the Statesman reported. His remains from a mass grave in Taiwan were identified decades later by the U.S. military using DNA testing. 
 What would the Bring Our Heroes Home Act do?

The legislation introduced Monday would create a collection of missing Armed Forces and civilian personnel records at the National Archives and Records Administration, require certain agencies find and send records of missing servicemember records to the archives, and create an independent Missing Armed Forces and Civilian Personnel Records Review Board.
Under most circumstances, the board would be required to publicly report its records. 
The review board would comprise five members appointed by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate, according to the bill. The board would include at least one attorney and at least one professional historian. 
The board would be required to submit an annual report that includes its expenditures, progress made, and suggestions or requests for Congress. The bill authorizes funding in such “sums that are necessary to carry out this Act,” but does not specify how much that would be. 
The Congressional Budget Office did not do a cost estimate of the similar bill introduced in 2023. 
 There are nearly 81,000 Americans who remain unaccounted for from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Cold War, the Gulf Wars and other conflicts, according to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. Around 360 of those missing servicemembers are from Idaho, including Atteberry’s brother, Lloyd Atteberry, who has been considered missing in action since he was reportedly shot down in 1943. 
Fellow U.S. Senator from Idaho Jim Risch is a co-sponsor of the bill, as well as U.S. Sens.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Four Republican states have agreed to help the Trump administration gain access to state driver’s license data through a nationwide law enforcement computer network as part of the administration’s hunt for alleged noncitizen voters.
The Trump administration said as recently as October that federal officials wanted to obtain driver’s license records through the network.
The commitment from officials in Florida, Indiana, Iowa and Ohio comes as part of a settlement agreement filed on Friday in a federal lawsuit. The lawsuit was originally brought by the states last year alleging the Biden administration wasn’t doing enough to help states verify voter eligibility.
The settlement, between the states and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, requires the federal department to continue its development of a powerful citizenship verification program known as SAVE. Earlier this year, federal officials repurposed SAVE into a program capable of scanning millions of state voter records for instances of noncitizen registered voters.
Trump wants states to feed voter info into powerful citizenship data program

In return, the states have agreed to support Homeland Security’s efforts to access the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, an obscure computer network that typically allows law enforcement agencies to search driver’s license records across state lines. Nlets — as the system is known — lets police officers easily look up the driving records of out-of-state motorists.
The Trump administration and some Republican election officials have promoted the changes to SAVE as a useful tool to identify potential noncitizen voters, and Indiana had already agreed to provide voter records. Critics, including some Democrats, say the Trump administration is building a massive database of U.S. residents that President Donald Trump or a future president could use for spying or targeting political enemies.
Stateline reported last week, before the settlement agreement was filed in court, that Homeland Security publicly confirmed it wants to connect Nlets to SAVE.
A notice published Oct. 31 in the Federal Register said driver’s licenses are the most widely used form of identification, and that by working with states and national agencies, including Nlets, “SAVE will use driver’s license and state identification card numbers to check and confirm identity information.”
A federal official also previously told a virtual meeting of state election officials in May that Homeland Security was seeking “to avoid having to connect to 50 state databases” and wanted a “simpler solution,” such as Nlets, according to government records published by the transparency group American Oversight.
The new settlement lays out the timeline for how the Trump administration could acquire the four states’ records.
Within 90 days of the execution of the agreement, the four states may provide Homeland Security with 1,000 randomly selected driver’s license records from their state for verification as part of a quality improvement process for SAVE.
According to the agreement, the states that provide the records will “make best efforts to support and encourage DHS’s efforts to receive and have full use of state driver’s license records from the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System” and state driver’s license agencies.
The language in the agreement is open-ended and doesn’t make clear whether the pledge to help Homeland Security obtain access to Nlets is limited to drivers from those four states or is intended to require the states to help the agency acquire the records of drivers nationwide.
An agreement to help
The agreement could pave the way for Republican officials in other states to provide access to license data.
Nlets is a nonprofit organization that facilitates data sharing among law enforcement agencies across state lines. States decide what information to make available through Nlets, and which agencies can access it. That means the four states could try to influence peers to share Nlets data with the Trump administration.
Homeland Security wants state driver’s license data for sweeping citizenship program

“They’re not just talking about driver’s license numbers, they’re talking about the driver’s records. What possible reason would DHS have in an election or voting context — or any context whatsoever — for obtaining the ‘full use of state driver’s license records,’” said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research.
Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican, said in a statement to Stateline that the settlement agreement provides another layer of election integrity and protection as officials seek to ensure only eligible voters are registered. He didn’t directly address questions about Nlets access.
“The SAVE program provides us with critical information, but we must also continue to utilize information from other state and federal partners to maintain clean and accurate lists,” Pate said in the statement.
Two weeks before the Nov. 5, 2024, election, Pate issued guidance to Iowa county auditors to challenge the ballots of 2,176 registered voters who were identified by the secretary of state’s office as potential noncitizens. The voters had reported to the state Department of Transportation or another government entity that they were not U.S. citizens in the past 12 years and went on to register to vote, according to the guidance.
In March, Pate said his office gained access to the SAVE database and found 277 of those people were confirmed to not have U.S. citizenship — just under 12% of the individuals identified as potential noncitizens.










What possible reason would DHS have in an election or voting context — or any context whatsoever — for obtaining the ‘full use of state driver’s license records.’ 


– David Becker, executive director, Center for Election Innovation & Research


Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment Monday.
Matthew Tragesser, a spokesperson for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — the agency under Homeland Security that oversees SAVE — told Stateline last week that USCIS was committed to “eliminating barriers to securing the nation’s electoral process.”
“By allowing states to efficiently verify voter eligibility, we are reinforcing the principle that America’s elections are reserved exclusively for American citizens,” Tragesser said in a statement.
The SAVE program — Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements — was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. In the past, SAVE could search only one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches; federal officials in May also connected the program to Social Security data.
“It’s a potentially dangerous mix to put driver’s license and Social Security number and date of birth information out there … where we really don’t know yet how and when and where it’s going to be used,” Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon said in an interview on Monday.
Democratic states object
As the Trump administration has encouraged states to use SAVE, the Justice Department has also demanded states provide the department with unredacted copies of their voter rolls. The Trump administration has previously confirmed the Justice Department is sharing voter information with Homeland Security.
The Justice Department has sued six, mostly Democratic, states for refusing to turn over the data. Those lawsuits remain pending.
DOJ is sharing state voter roll lists with Homeland Security

On Monday, 12 state secretaries of state submitted a 29-page public comment, in response to SAVE’s Federal Register notice, criticizing the overhaul. The secretaries wrote that while Homeland Security claims the changes make the program an effective tool for verifying voters, the modifications are “likely to degrade, not enhance” states’ efforts to ensure free, fair and secure elections.
“What the modified system will do … is allow the federal government to capture sensitive data on hundreds of millions of voters nationwide and distribute that information as it sees fit,” the secretaries wrote.
The secretaries of state of California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington signed on to the comment.
The settlement agreement purports to make this year’s changes to SAVE legally binding.
The agreement asks that a federal court retain jurisdiction over the case for 20 years for the purposes of enforcing it — a move that in theory could make it harder for a future Democratic president to reverse the changes to SAVE.
But Becker, of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, said he doesn’t expect the settlement agreement would make it more difficult for a future administration to undo the overhaul.
“Should a different administration come in that disagrees with this approach,” Becker said, “I would expect that they would almost certainly completely change how the system operates and how the states can access it and what data the federal government procures.”

(Photo courtesy of the Utah Department of Health and Human Services)With the arrival of the holiday season, Utah state officials are holding an annual giving drive to gather donations for those who may feel alone — including mental health patients, adults who are wards of the state, and youth in the juvenile justice system. 
“This effort helps make sure vulnerable people receive gifts, necessities, and the assurance that someone cares,” the Utah Department of Health and Human Services said in a news release issued Monday. 
As part of the giving drive, Department of Health and Human Services staff manage donations, purchase and wrap gifts, and distribute them to those in need. 
Here’s a breakdown of how to help: 
The Forgotten Patient 
The Forgotten Patient Holiday Project is meant to bring holiday cheer to patients at the Utah State Hospital who otherwise may not receive anything due to a lack of family or other difficult circumstances. 
The Utah State Hospital, based in Provo, is a state-run psychiatric hospital for people with severe mental illness. 
“Being in a hospital over the holidays can be difficult for patients, especially for those without family or loved ones to visit them,” state officials said in Monday’s news release. 
The Forgotten Patient Christmas Project has a long history in Utah — having helped hospital patients for more than 60 years, according to the Utah State Hospital’s website. Each year, about 400 volunteers donate their time, money and gifts to make it possible. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In 2022, 315 patients were sponsored, “and each patient knew that someone was thinking about them during the holiday season,” according to state hospital officials. 
For the project, each patient writes a list of what they would like for Christmas, and a sponsor purchases some or all of those items. Some community groups also do service projects to provide stockings filled with candy and personal hygiene items, while others put on musical concerts for the patients. 
Those who volunteer as sponsors will receive an information sheet about a person, which includes clothing sizes, hobbies, interests, favorite treats, and other requests. The sheet will also include safety guidelines for those buying gifts. 
The gifts will then be delivered to the hospital, where staff will check them for safety concerns before wrapping them and delivering them to patients on Christmas morning. 
The state hospital also accepts cash donations if you want to help but aren’t able to sponsor a patient. 
To learn more or to volunteer, contact Cami Roundy at camiroundy@utah.gov. 
Office of Public Guardian clients
The Utah Office of Public Guardian is a state agency that provides guardianship services to about 250 adults who are unable to make basic life decisions for themselves and have no other family to care for them. 
Each holiday season, many people served by the Office of Public Guardian are in need of items like clothing, bedding, and personal care supplies. 
The Office of Public Guardian uses donations to give clients a “personalized and positive holiday experience and to make sure they have what they need throughout the rest of the year as well,” state officials said. 
The office is accepting donations in the form of cash, checks or gift cards to ensure everyone the office serves receives a gift during the holidays. 
Gift cards can be purchased via the office’s Amazon wish list. You can also email  utahopg@utah.gov or call 801-538-8255 for more information. 
Juvenile Justice and Youth Services
State officials are also holding a gift drive for the Division of Juvenile Justice and Youth Services, which is meant to benefit youth in the juvenile justice system. 
The gift drive helps gather personal items, clothing, books, and other gifts for kids in 13 youth centers across the state. 
State officials are accepting donations through Amazon wish lists made for each youth center by location. Visit the state’s website to select a wish list by location.

A court challenge is anticipated if a redistricting plan is adopted. But provisions in the redistricting legislation, House Bill 1032, also would prevent county-level judges from blocking new congressional maps and direct any appeals immediately to the Indiana Supreme Court.
 

The House Elections and Apportionment Committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing beginning at 9 a.m. Tuesday on the redistricting bill. The hearing is set for the House chamber and to end no later than 2:45 p.m. 
The online form to sign up to testify in person is available beginning at midnight Tuesday.



Passage of the redistricting plan isn’t assured because of persistent resistance from several Republican state senators. Several of those senators have cited widespread voter opposition to changing the current GOP-drawn maps adopted in 2021 that have seen Republicans maintain a 7-2 Indiana congressional majority.
Republican House Speaker Todd Huston acknowledged the political motivations behind the proposed new map, which splits strongly Democratic Indianapolis among four districts that all stretch far into rural, heavily Republican counties.
“We’ve always had districts that span hundreds of miles,” Huston told reporters. “The maps were put together with the interest of trying to create as many Republican seats as possible.”
Proposed maps overhaul all 9 districts
Linda Butler of Lawrence in northeastern Marion County was among a few hundred protesters at a Monday anti-redistricting rally inside the Statehouse.
Butler criticized the proposed map for obliterating the current 7th District, where she lives. It is currently held by Democratic Rep. André Carson. The proposal would put her home in a new 7th District, spanning from the north side of Indianapolis to the Ohio River near Cincinnati.
“They’re doing it so that they can win elections,” Butler said of Republicans. “It is terrible. I think it’s terrible. That’s an illustration for me that this is wrong.”
The proposed map drastically overhauls all nine Indiana congressional districts, but Huston said he did not know how many people would be in different districts.
For instance, the 8th District now held by Republican Rep. Erin Houchin, who is from rural southern Indiana’s Washington County, would lose its southeastern Indiana counties near Cincinnati. The revamped district would span from near downtown Indianapolis to the Ohio River counties just north of Louisville, Kentucky. 
State Rep. Wendy Dant Chesser, D-Jeffersonville, called the proposal “completely unfair to residents of Southern Indiana.”
“We’re impacted more by Louisville than by Indianapolis,” Dant Cheser said. “It’s not the same for Central Indiana. Our representative in Congress will have split loyalties between two major metropolitan areas with two very different needs.”
It was uncertain from the proposed map released Monday whether the Indianapolis home of Carson, the Democratic congressman, was placed in a district with Houchin or Republican Rep. Jefferson Shreve of Indianapolis.
“Splicing our state’s largest city — and its biggest economic driver — into four parts is ridiculous,” Carson said in a statement. “It’s clear these orders are coming from Washington, and they clearly don’t know the first thing about our community.”
The Lake Michigan shoreline area that now makes up the 1st District held by Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan would be split in two by the new map.
Republicans propose a new 1st District taking in Democratic-friendly Lake County then heading southeast to take in the areas around the small cities of Logansport, Peru and Wabash.
Political breakdown of proposed maps
Trump won each of the districts under the proposed map by at least 12 percentage points in the 2024 election, according to an analysis by Indianapolis City-County Councilor Nick Roberts, a Democrat.
Trump’s narrowest win was in the proposed 1st District, where Republican Gov. Mike Braun won by a 6 percentage point margin, according to Roberts.
J. Miles Coleman, the associate editor of political analysis site Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia, predicted Democrats’ performance there would mirror broader electoral trends — such as if the 2026 midterms end up a “Democratic wave.”
“Under that logic, maybe Mrvan actually does have a decent shot of holding onto his seat,” Coleman said.
The new Indianapolis-area seats, however, would be “fairly secure,” according to Coleman: they “vote pretty much like the state as a whole,” 60-40 for Trump, when using 2024 election data.
State Rep. Earl Harris, D-East Chicago, told the anti-redistricting rally crowd that he objected to Republicans calling the Legislature back into session weeks ahead of its planned Jan. 5 return to push through redistricting.

Harris, who is chair of the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus, argued redrawing of the 1st District where he lives did not make sense and shouldn’t take priority over dealing with problems such as rising health care, utility and child care costs.
“If we come in early, we need to come in for real issues facing real Hoosiers,” Harris said.
Republicans shift on map standards
Huston acknowledged the proposed congressional map was developed in conjunction with the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which was also involved in drawing the new map adopted by Texas Republicans this summer.
While this year’s redistricting wave started in Texas, Indiana House Elections Committee Chair Tim Wesco, R-Osceola, said he supported Republicans responding to previous congressional maps drawn in Democratic-led states.
“You could trace it back to when Illinois adopted their maps years ago, and they’re ridiculous, where they eliminated three Republican seats in the 2021 redistricting,” Wesco told the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
Wesco in 2021 praised the Republican-sponsored Indiana maps for their compactness and maintaining “communities of interest.”
Asked whether those standards should still apply, Wesco replied, “The maps we adopted in 2021 were excellent maps, no doubt. But 2025 is not 2021.”
Court fight anticipated
Redistricting opponents vowed to challenge a finalized map but said they’re still tailoring their legal strategies to the draft released Monday.
“It’s a little too early to speak specifically, but I can tell you: absolutely, conversations are being had right now, and should maps be passed, they will be challenged almost immediately,” said Julia Vaughn, executive director of nonpartisan elections watchdog Common Cause Indiana.

Racial gerrymandering could be the centerpiece of a lawsuit at the federal level, but there’s also discussion of state-level legal fights, she said.
Lawmakers could be part of that fight. The Indiana Black Legislative Caucus, made up of more than a dozen Black lawmakers — all Democrats — gathered Monday afternoon to denounce the proposed districts.
“They’re racially gerrymandered. There’s no ifs, ands and buts about it,” said Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis.
Language in the bill, however, would constrain challenges in state courts.
The legislation would prohibit seeking or granting temporary injunctions, which would otherwise block the map from going into effect.
Lawsuits can “disrupt the orderly conduct” of elections, the bill reads – and so can “judicial alterations.” Court action can “undermine voter confidence.”
It also mandates that the Indiana Supreme Court have “exclusive” jurisdiction over any appeal of an order promoting an injunction. Actions covered by this chunk of text “must be given priority over ordinary matters,” the bill reads.
Huston said the intent of that language is “just making sure there’s a process to get to the Supreme Court as quickly as possible. They’re the final determinant.”
Asked if the provisions could overstep separation between the three branches of government, he said, “No.”
 Threats continue

Several GOP senators and Indiana Gov. Mike Braun have reported intimidation attempts, plus swatting and bomb threats. Their stances on redistricting run the gamut, from opposed to undecided to supportive.
Sen. Mike Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, on Monday became the latest to confirm a bomb threat targeting his home. Sen. Jean Leising, R-Oldenburg, also reported a “pipe bomb threat” at her home Saturday evening.
Both Bohacek and Leising have said they are against redrawing the congressional maps.
“I will not cave” on redistricting, Leising wrote in a message to constituents. “I will be fighting for all of you in this early session!”

(Joshua Bowling/Source NM)A child or teenager will be arrested and charged with possessing a firearm on three out of four days in New Mexico, the governor’s senior public safety adviser said Monday.
“That number is way too high,” Benjamin Baker, senior public safety adviser to Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham told Republican members on the New Mexico GOP’s Public Safety Legislative Task Force. “Work needs to be done to address what is happening with that age creep and violence related to our juvenile offenders.”
He said that the Albuquerque Public Schools system has caught students bringing guns to school 10 times this academic year.
Baker was one speaker in a daylong series of panel discussions that ranged from the challenges of preventing drug trafficking to barriers to holding repeat offenders in jail. Public safety has factored prominently into the governor’s legislative agenda. Last year, she called a special legislative session on crime reporting, gun violence, drug overdoses and more. The special session adjourned after just five hours without passing any legislation related to crime, public safety or drug use — though Senate Republicans introduced more than a dozen.
The subject of repeat offenders has become a common refrain on the campaign trail among New Mexico gubernatorial hopefuls. However, a 2024 Legislative Finance Committee report found that “most dismissals for repeat offenders were due to issues with evidence collection and victim or witness cooperation.”
That same report found that New Mexico’s crime rate is consistently above the national average. In the state’s largest city, though, police data shows that levels of property crimes, violent crimes and homicides are down year-over-year, while arrest numbers are up. The data shows that Albuquerque logged 5,260 violent crimes from January to September of 2024 and 4,601 from January to September of this year. Likewise, there were 87 homicides logged by September of 2024 and 58 by September of this year.
In November, Legislative Finance Committee analysts told state lawmakers that youthful offenders in New Mexico return to the justice system because of a lack of prevention programs and significant gaps in behavioral health services. The Legislative Finance Committee report found that New Mexico’s kids experience outsized rates of adverse childhood experiences like physical abuse and household substance abuse. It noted that juvenile suspects have faced an uptick in charges of battery, fighting, carrying a deadly weapon on school property and cannabis possession in restricted areas. New Mexico routinely ranks 50th for child well-being in the national Kids Count report published by the nonpartisan Annie E. Casey Foundation, which is dedicated to researching child welfare. 
While elected Democrats and Republicans alike have called for legislative remedies to juvenile crime, members of the legislative task force on Monday voiced frustration with how their public safety proposals have failed to advance through the state Legislature. Multiple times, they mentioned Senate Bill 166, sponsored by Sen. Antonio “Moe” Maestas (D-Albuquerque) in this year’s regular session, which would have changed the state law’s definition of “a harm to self’ and ‘harm to others” to permit more people to be civilly committed to locked facilities. The bill cleared the Senate but died in the House.
“When we’re bringing this legislation,” said Rep. Nicole Chavez (R-Albuquerque), whose son was killed in a 2015 drive-by shooting, “they die in their first committee.”
Behind the dais at Monday’s meeting was a panel made up solely of Republicans. When discussion drifted toward partisan talking points, one senator was quick to defend the Democratic governor. 
“Keeping New Mexico safe should not be a partisan issue,” said task force Co-Chair Sen. Crystal Brantley (R-Elephant Butte). “The far right is pretty quick to say ‘Well, crime is up, we’re the most dangerous state in the nation because we have a Democrat governor.’ The reality is, that’s not fair. We’re not even getting these bills to her desk.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/122125-legislative-task-force-1024x767.png,,,2025-12-01 18:58:51.562637

When Chesapeake Bay governors and other leaders gather at the National Aquarium on Tuesday to consider the next bay cleanup agreement, they’ll be joined by leaders from several federally recognized Native American tribes in Virginia.
The tribal leaders will present a symbolic gift of wild rice, to represent growing a partnership between the tribes and state and federal leaders — who are about to spend seven months determining whether the tribes can have a seat at the table as decisions are made about the bay.
It’s taken almost a year for tribes to even get to this point.
“We’ve come such a long way from where we started — which was another absence, which was no conversation,” said Melissa Ann Ehrenreich, executive director of the Indigenous Conservation Council. The council was formed in 2022 to represent the seven Virginia tribes that gained federal recognition between 2015 and 2018.
The tribes formally asked to be included as signatories to the next bay agreement, only to run up against the layers of bureaucracy at the Bay Program that Ehrenreich concedes have proven stifling.
“It has been frustrating to participate at multiple different levels and feel like: ‘Wow, why couldn’t we have done this over the last year?’” Ehrenreich asked. “The bay can’t wait.”

The yearlong delay is partially about timing: The Bay Program is led by the executive council, which includes Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D), Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D)  and other governors in the watershed, who only convene once a year. At its last meeting, in Annapolis last December, the council only directed staff to revise the bay agreement — not to add signatories.
That was the reason cited in a June letter in response to the tribes.
A document going before the governors on Tuesday will give Bay Program officials the go-ahead to study tribal inclusion, and “develop recommendations by July 1, 2026, on how best to include tribes across the watershed in the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) partnership.”
That could include adding the tribes, or the ICC, to the Bay agreement as a signatory, on equal footing with Maryland and the other states, according to the document.
The document also states that officials “may prepare a draft memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the federally recognized tribes within the watershed outlining CBP partner expectations and commitments, recognizing budgetary and resource needs and constraints,” the document continues.
The tribes are approaching the Bay Program at a difficult juncture for the agreement.
The states in the watershed, including Pennsylvania, failed to reach pollution-cutting goals outlined in the previous agreement by 2025, forcing them back to the drawing board to revise their pact. After months of deliberation, the states and federal officials agreed to a 2040 deadline for those same pollution reductions.
The proposed new plan also updates a host of other goals, including for underwater grass acreage, wetland restoration and forest conservation. But some environmentalists have raised alarm that some of the goals were revised downward compared to the earlier version, making them easier for the bay states to achieve.
Even with a series of bay agreements dating back to the 1980s, improving conditions in the bay has proven a challenge. In the late ‘80s, water quality testing determined that 26.5% of the bay’s tidal waters met standards. Today, that number is 29.4%. Bay Program officials view it as a victory, since they’re up against climate change and increasing development and population in the watershed.
Not everyone agrees.
“The effort is expensive, and it’s failing. They’re not making any progress at all, hardly,” said Chief Frank Adams of the Upper Mattaponi Indian Tribe, an ICC member, in an interview last month. “Why keep doing the same thing over and over? Let’s try something else. Let’s include the Native cultural knowledge and Native people.”
Part of the problem is that East Coast states are unaccustomed to considering tribal governments, with federally recognized tribes a rarity, Adams said.
“This is the first time the state of Virginia has ever had a federally recognized tribe, and they didn’t know how to deal with us,” Adams said. “Up and down the East Coast and the states that are feeding into the Chesapeake Bay: Pennsylvania, Maryland, all the other states, have no federally recognized tribes, so it was not even a thought that they should include the sovereign nations of Virginia into the discussion.”
Adams argues that tribes have lots to contribute. After the Upper Mattaponi won federal recognition, for instance, an environmental department was the first to be established, using grant funding. Adams said the department now has five staff members and focuses on issues including battling invasive fish. Other Virginia tribes have taken a similar approach.
Tribal leaders said they were not expecting the Bay Program to have such a lengthy procedure for considering their inclusion.
“I just saw it as more walls of colonialism — that [they] had not had Indigenous people involved,” said Chief Anne Richardson of the Rappahannock Tribe, an ICC member, in a November interview.
“And they felt there was no need to have Indigenous people involved at that level, although all of our watersheds are feeding off of the bay, and we’ve stewarded the bay and these rivers for thousands of years — and did a good job, without the millions and billions of dollars that the government seems to be pouring into it now,” she said.
In fact, the very name of the Chesapeake Bay is derived from an Algonquian word, Chesapiooc.
“We just want a seat at the table, so that we have decision-making authority, just like everybody else that sits at the table,” Richardson said. “You would think in 2025 that wouldn’t be an issue, but obviously it is.”
Leaders at the Bay Program say they aren’t throwing hurdles in front of the tribes.
“It’s not a ‘no.’ And it’s not like if you miss this boat, we move on,” said Anna Killius, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, during an interview earlier this year. The commission is a signatory on the bay agreement which represents lawmakers from Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
In more recent comments, Bay Program officials said they’re optimistic about future discussions with the tribes.
“Indigenous communities in this region have thousands of years of insight into land and water management that the Chesapeake Bay Program can greatly benefit from as we continue our work to improve Chesapeake Bay water quality and wildlife,” said Leila Duman, bays restoration officer for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.
“Maryland is supportive of the efforts to include representatives from these communities more formally as part of the Chesapeake Bay Program,” Duman said. “We look forward to participating in the next steps.”
Virginia officials declined to comment through the Bay Program, but added that their sentiment is similar to Maryland’s.
Dan Coogan, a 20-year EPA veteran who was named Bay Program director in October, said the “EPA and the Bay Partners are working with those federally recognized tribal nations to develop recommendations on how best to include tribes across the watershed. EPA looks forward to this discussion at the upcoming Executive Council meeting.”

If the Virginia tribes were to win signatory status on the Bay agreement, and representation on the executive council, it would be a relatively rare occurrence in the United States, said Lauren Wiederkehr, a law student at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, who studied the issue as a summer law clerk this year for the Chesapeake Legal Alliance.
The closest analogy might be the Puget Sound Partnership in Washington, which currently includes two Indigenous representatives on its leadership council.
One of them is Russell Hepfer, 69, a member of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, who has been serving on the Puget Sound leadership council since 2014. Hepfer said that fishing rights treaties between tribes and state governments make inclusion more commonplace at groups like the Puget Sound Partnership.
He said it has also helped that he could follow in the footsteps of other tribal leaders, including Billy Frank Jr., a Nisqually tribal member and well-known activist for tribal fishing rights in the Pacific Northwest who served on the leadership council as well.
But just getting a seat on the leadership council wasn’t enough: It’s a constant battle to educate others in leadership about tribes and their roles, Hepfer said.
“When people leave, retire, or whatever happens, you have to re-educate the next person,” he said.
Hepfer, who has served on the tribal council of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe for 24 years, said he views that education as a personal mission.
“We’re still a second-class group, but we have to keep telling our story,” he said.

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)Before the Hope Hospice Center opened in Missoula in July, people working on the project toured different facilities in the country looking for ideas.
Betsy Wackernagel Bach, chairperson of the Partners Hope Foundation, said hospice supporters in Montana toured seven different places, and they quizzed those who had forged the path.
“We asked them: What did they like? What didn’t they like? What did they wish they had done?” Bach said.
Then, when the in-patient hospice in Billings closed, Amanda Yeoman Melro, executive director of Partners Hope Foundation, said she called to learn their lessons, and Billings was ready to share.

In their research, the team learned that it was just as important to plan for sustainability as it was to plan to open a hospice. They learned that families are as integral to the mission as their loved ones, even that it’s advisable to have multiple USB ports in a room and couches that convert into beds.
Now, four months after opening its doors to families across Montana, the Hope Hospice Center has served more than 100 patients and their families, exceeded a $15 million capital campaign by $200,000, and it’s embarking on its next phase, to connect with referral sources that will help keep the center open and make good on its mission.
“Hope Hospice Center is a community promise to care for our neighbors through all of life’s stages,” Yeoman Melro said.
Up next?
“We’re moving into sustainability,” Yeoman Melro said.
Indeed, sustainability is an intrinsic part of the project, Bach said; the team wanted to not only build a center, but ensure it could stay open, and it saw this value as key.
“Sustainability became our mantra,” Bach said.
Only in-patient hospice in western Montana
The Hope Hospice Center is the only in-patient hospice facility in western Montana, and since RiverStone Health Hospice Home closed in Billings in June 2024, it is one of just two in-patient hospice centers in the state, Yeoman Melro said.

The other is in Great Falls, Benefis Peace Hospice of Montana, part of the Benefis Health System.
The Missoula center serves people from across the state and beyond, Yeoman Melro said. For example, if a Missoula resident has a family member who lives out of state but needs help in Montana, that family member can be a patient here.
The recent closure and the demographics of Montana make the center especially important, Yeoman Melro said.
“Montana is a huge state, and our population is aging quicker than others, and a lot of our seniors — (an estimated 40%) — live alone,” Melro said. “We see a lot of people who don’t really have a lot of family around.”
In 2017, the Partners Hope Foundation formed, put together by a group of community members and medical professionals dedicated to opening a hospice center “owned by the community,” not a large medical system.
Yeoman Melro said a land donation by community philanthropists Terry and Patt Payne helped kickstart the project, and Bach said an article in The Atlantic about how corporate medicine was dragging down hospice care showed the importance of sustainability.
The idea led to a partnership with a nonprofit provider, Partners In Home Care, and it also helped lead to the Compassionate Care Fund, which collects donations and supports patients who can’t afford the cost of regular care.
The center takes insurance, and it offers a sliding fee scale for room and board fees for residential patients. Hospice care is most often covered by the Medicare Hospice Benefit, Medicaid Hospice Benefit, Veterans Affairs benefits, Indian Health Service and private insurance plans.
The center offers general in-patient care for patients who need intensive 24-hour medical management; residential hospice for those who need more support than caregivers at home can offer; and respite care, a five-day admission that gives a primary caregiver temporary relief.

In July, supported by 800 donors, the center opened on the west side of town a couple of blocks off of Reserve Street, a main thoroughfare in Missoula.
It has 12 individual patient rooms, plus other spaces in 15,000 square feet, such as a room for children; snack bar offering soup and cookies 24 hours a day; living area with fireplace, library and educational resources; staff offices; and more.
The center opened with six patient rooms in operation, and Yeoman Melro said the goal is to be full by July 2026 with all 12 rooms occupied. It operates with 18 staff members, plus volunteers, who Melro said are critical to the operation.
Two nurses and one aide are on duty throughout the day, part of the support from Partners In Home Care, which has a medical director, nurse practitioners, pharmacist, nurses, social workers, chaplains, CNAs and administrators.
At the time the center opened, Corin Schneider, CEO of Partners In Home Care, said the highly skilled team was committed to delivering comprehensive, “whole-person” medical and emotional support for patients and loved ones.
“As Montana’s population continues to age, the need for inpatient hospice services is greater than ever,” Schneider said.
A homey place that looks and feels like Montana
Now that the center is open, the next phase is developing referral sources, Yeoman Melro said. Outreach meetings are taking place with physicians and medical groups, all part of the plan for sustainability.

Ongoing fundraising is important to maintain a reserve fund, refill the Compassionate Care Fund, and support some of the beautification and operational needs of the center, such as for sprinklers on the grounds in common areas.
“This is a startup. These are really expensive to run,” Yeoman Melro said.
Most hospice centers are owned by hospitals or other private providers or existing businesses, but this one is “owned by the community,” or stewarded and supported by community members, Yeoman Melro said, including a board of directors of 19.
(The center was designed to be able to expand in the future as well; for example, the HVAC system can handle another 12 beds down the road, Yeoman Melro said.)
The center was designed to look and feel like Montana, showcase artists from the state, including Indigenous ones, and be more homey than a clinical space, she said.
It has windows that let in natural light, natural wood features, and pieces of art throughout by Montana artists, including Stephanie Frostad, of Missoula, and Aspen Decker, based in Arlee.
Decker was and named one of the state’s top emerging artists this year by the Montana Museum of Art and Culture, which curated additional pieces for the center.

The center has rooms for both patients and families. For example, a spa room has a wash bowl and a bathtub that are easy for patients and caregivers to use, and in that space, caregivers can clean wounds or help with other needs.
“Sometimes you just need a haircut and a shave,” Yeoman Melro said.
Yeoman Melro said one thing the team learned from other hospices is they had “no place to pause,” no place for families to reflect after their loved ones die, so the Hope Hospice Center created an area with that idea in mind.
It has items for people of all denominations, a room for a chaplain to visit, and a fan for smudging ceremonies, she said.
Bach, board chairperson, said support for families evolved as the team did its research. They found hospice is as much about family care as it is a transition for someone who is at life’s end, and they’ve heard families feel cared for there, and the space feels warm.
Now, they want to get the word out, both that the center is taking patients, and also, that people shouldn’t assume they can’t afford it, given the insurance options and Compassionate Care Fund, Bach said.
“People need to know that we’re open,” Bach said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hospice-Centerpiece-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-01 17:57:30.442726

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Some of North Carolina’s political hopefuls made their 2026 bids official Monday, lining up at the state fairgrounds to file for election. Democrats aim to hold a crucial Supreme Court seat and chip away at Republican majorities in lower courts.
Candidates for state and federal office have until Friday, Dec. 19 to file for the March 3 primary election. Among the most high-profile contests for the midterm year: an open U.S. Senate seat, a state Supreme Court seat that could determine next decade’s redistricting, and a redrawn congressional district.
“I am just really excited about the prospect of, over the next 11 months, going out and explaining to voters of North Carolina why our state courts matter so much to them,” said state Supreme Court Associate Justice Anita Earls, a Democrat running for re-election to the high court, after filing Monday in Raleigh.
Her vision for the court, Earls said, is as a “check and balance” on the executive and legislative branches, the latter of which is controlled by Republicans. So is the Supreme Court, which has final say on key legislative maneuvers and congressional mapmaking. But if Democrats can hold Earls’ seat, they have a chance to oust two of three Republicans up in 2028 and retake a majority.
Earls will likely face state Rep. Sarah Stevens, a Surry County Republican in November, assuming neither of them attract primary challengers. The race will be high-profile, expensive and potentially litigious: Republicans unsuccessfully sought to overturn another Democratic high court incumbent’s victory in 2024.
Stevens had not yet filed paperwork for her campaign as of Monday afternoon.
Earls was joined Monday by two Democrats running for re-election to the Court of Appeals, Judge Toby Hampson and John Arrowood.
Another Court of Appeals seat, being vacated by Judge Allegra Collins, will see a contested Democratic primary. Judge Christine Walczyk, a longtime district court judge in Wake County, and James Whalen, a Raleigh attorney who served on Justice Allison Riggs’ legal team in the 2024 election court battle, both filed to run for the seat Monday.
Republicans hold 12 of the 15 seats on the Court of Appeals.
The race for U.S. Senate, meanwhile, is almost certainly set but not yet official. Former Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, and former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley have both announced runs but did not file Monday.
Republican Don Brown of Waxhaw, N.C. has filed to challenge Whatley for the Republican nomination. Democrats Justin Dues, who unsuccessfully challenged U.S. Rep. Mark Harris in 2024, and political newcomer Orrick Quick have also filed federal paperwork to challenge Cooper for the seat.
Just one candidate, Republican Elizabeth Temple of Smithfield, has filed for Senate in North Carolina as of Monday afternoon. A former primary candidate for state House, Temple was accused of making offensive comments to students as a substitute teacher for Wake County Public Schools in 2019. She later defended herself, saying the allegations were “not true.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_4778-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-01 17:57:30.442726

The populist senator looks for candidates with a similar progressive stripe.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  How Bernie Sanders Is weighing 2026 endorsements.","Michigan Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, left, and Sen. Bernie Sanders raise their arms after addressing supporters during a rally for El-Sayed on Aug. 5, 2018, in Detroit. File photo by Carlos Osorio/AP
This story by Torrie Herrington was first published in NOTUS on Nov. 24, 2025.
A Bernie Sanders endorsement doesn’t always mean a primary win — some voters might even see it as a red flag. But for progressive and populist candidates, the Vermont senator’s stamp of approval can be a major boost.
So how does Sanders determine which candidates to back?
It comes down to values, strategy and who wants it, a spokesperson for Sanders’ campaign arm told NOTUS.
“Sen. Sanders is always interested in working with progressive candidates who are running strong grassroots campaigns, prepared to work hard, and want to challenge establishment status quo. He doesn’t endorse any candidate unless they want his endorsement,” Anna Bahr, communications director for Sanders, said in a statement to NOTUS.
For the 2026 election cycle, Sanders has endorsed three Democratic Senate candidates: Graham Platner in Maine, Abdul El-Sayed in Michigan and Peggy Flanagan in Minnesota. For the House, he is backing Randy Villegas in California, Robert Peters in Illinois, Donavan McKinney in Michigan, Bob Brooks in Pennsylvania and Rebecca Cooke in Wisconsin. He also endorsed Troy Jackson for Maine governor and Keith Ellison for Minnesota attorney general.
Joe Calvello, a senior adviser for the Platner campaign, said the campaign reached out for an endorsement because Platner has been a longtime supporter of Sanders. He said they were “extremely grateful” for the endorsement, which came at a “Fight the Oligarchy” rally in Portland, Maine, on Labor Day.
“To be able to do a big event with him in Portland was really special, to do that right when our campaign was getting off the ground,” said Calvello, who is also a former Sanders adviser.
In the 2024 election cycle, Sanders endorsed seven people in congressional races, five of whom lost their primary elections and two who went on to win in the general: Reps. Ilhan Omar and Summer Lee. On the state legislature level, Sanders endorsed four people in 2024, three of whom won.
Sanders-backed candidates have won big this year, particularly New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who received a Sanders endorsement in June in the Democratic primary. (The Mamdani campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the endorsement.)
In 2025, Sanders also endorsed Rep. Adelita Grijalva, who won her special election in Arizona, and he endorsed Susan Crawford, who won the general election for the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
The only person Sanders endorsed who lost in 2025 was Joshua Weil in the special election for the U.S. House in Florida’s 6th Congressional District.
“I can tell you, talking to individuals who worked for Zohran Mamdani, who just won the mayoral race, they will tell you that when Sanders endorsed Mamdani, that had a huge impact on his support,” said Matthew Dickinson, a political science professor at Middlebury College in Vermont. “That legitimized him as a voice of the progressive left. So it can certainly have a big impact.”
He described an endorsement from Sanders as a “powerful tool.”
“Sanders is probably the individual with the most clout who represents that side of the Democratic Party, along with AOC,” Dickinson said of the senator and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “His endorsement, I think for that reason, might potentially carry more weight going forward, because the Democratic Party is searching for a winning message.”
That’s not to say it’s always a good thing. Dickinson said that for “people who don’t share Bernie’s opinions — it’s not going to have much impact on them. If anything, it might polarize them to oppose the candidate.”
El-Sayed told NOTUS he reached out to Sanders when he was thinking about getting into the race for Michigan’s open Senate seat. El-Sayed said he and Sanders have a “long relationship” — the senator also endorsed him in a failed 2018 bid for governor.
“As I was thinking about running, I certainly sought his counsel and his support. And I’m really grateful that he offered both,” El-Sayed said.
He said he hoped that he could be a senator in the mold of Sanders.
“Bernie has been fighting for working people his entire career, since before I was born, and that he sees that fight in this campaign … that means a lot to me,”El-Sayed said. “I look forward to carrying forward that kind of leadership and the work on behalf of working people in the U.S. Senate, hopefully, when I get to join him.”
A spokesperson for Flanagan, who is facing Rep. Angie Craig in Minnesota’s U.S. Senate primary, said Sanders’ endorsement shows off her progressive bona fides.
“Folks from across the country trust Bernie Sanders because of his unwavering commitment to working people, so his stamp of progressive approval means a lot to the movement Peggy is building,” campaign spokesperson Alexandra Fetissoff said in a statement to NOTUS.
Sen. Peter Welch, who represents Vermont alongside Sanders, was endorsed by Sanders when he launched his Senate bid in 2021.
“It was very helpful,” Welch said. “Bernie is one of the few senators whose endorsement has a lot of punch.”

(Photo courtesy of Entergy Louisiana)Entergy Louisiana began construction Monday on a pair of gas power plants that will generate electricity for what will be the world’s largest data center.
Entergy Corp., the largest investor-owned utility company in the state, announced it broke ground on its Franklin Farms Power Station project in Richland Parish. The company disseminated a photo from the groundbreaking ceremony showing a group of politicians, regulators and corporate executives digging into a box of sand at the construction site. 
The facility will power a massive $27 billion data center Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is building. It will feature two natural gas-powered plants able to generate about 1,500 megawatts of electricity, many times more than what the sparsely populated farming community of Richland Parish consumes. 
Proposed less than a year ago, the fast-paced power project received expedited approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission in August. New power plants of similar type typically go through several years of planning and hearings before construction begins. 
Construction on Meta’s largest data center brings 600% crash spike, chaos to rural Louisiana

The new power plant complex is being built specifically for the data center, though it will be connected to the larger electric grid and could supply power to other customers. 
Construction on the data center itself is also underway, bringing loads of new workers and traffic to the normally sleepy Richland Parish. 
The Franklin Farms project, which is expected to come online in late 2028, is not the only power station Entergy is building for the data center. Entergy plans to build a third plant at its Waterford nuclear power plant site in St. Charles Parish, with an expected operational date by the end of 2029. 
Together, all three gas plants will be able to generate approximately 2,200 megawatts of electricity, which is more than twice the capacity of the entire city of New Orleans, according to the Alliance for Affordable Energy.
“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,” Entergy Louisiana CEO Phillip May said in a news release. “By investing in efficient technologies and robust infrastructure, we’re ensuring that Louisiana remains a competitive, attractive place to live, work, and do business both today and well into the future.”

Vermont is among many federal districts where President Donald Trump has not nominated a U.S. attorney for confirmation through the U.S. Senate.

The U.S. Department of Justice lists the top prosecutor position in Vermont as vacant, but the person who has been running that office for nearly a year said he is running the show.
The situation in Vermont is not unique, and has led to confusion and court cases around the country regarding who is legally carrying out federal law. 
Michael Drescher — a longtime federal prosecutor in Vermont — has held the post of acting U.S. attorney for Vermont since President Donald Trump took office in January.
U.S. attorneys are responsible for prosecuting federal crimes and immigration law as well as representing the United States in civil matters. 
Drescher’s title changed from “acting” last month but he wasn’t named to the U.S. attorney post on a permanent basis by Trump, which would have required Senate confirmation.
Instead, Drescher is listed as “First Assistant U.S. Attorney” in press releases issued by his office. In an email to VTDigger, Drescher stated, “I am still leading the office.” 
He did not respond to a followup email seeking answers to why the change was made, or who made the decision. 
The U.S. Department of Justice, headed by U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi, did not respond to a request for comment. 
“There is a lot of confusion around the use of ‘interim,’ ‘acting’ and ‘first assistant’,” said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor who tracks U.S. attorney and judicial nominations.
“From my perspective, it’s avoiding what the Constitution requires, which is advice and consent of the Senate,” he said of the naming of U.S. attorneys. “In Trump 2.0 they’ve played fast and loose with that, and this is another example of it.” 
Tobias said it’s difficult to say for certain why Trump doesn’t simply nominate a U.S. attorney for Vermont and go through the U.S. Senate confirmation process. 
It’s possible, Tobias said, that the president doesn’t want to go through that process or fears that nominee’s confirmation wouldn’t be successful, or that he hasn’t found someone he wants to formally name to the post permanently.
Tobias said he also didn’t know the exact number of times during the Trump administration that an acting U.S. attorney for a federal district has later been named first assistant U.S. attorney to lead an office. 
“I can’t tell you how many places this has happened, but it has happened,” he said, adding that many other districts are overseen by either acting or interim U.S. attorneys.
In only about 20 of the 94 federal districts, Tobias said, has a U.S. attorney gone through the U.S. Senate confirmation process during Trump’s current administration. 
It’s difficult to determine from the U.S. Department of Justice website exactly how many interim, acting, first assistants and Senate-confirmed U.S. attorneys are leading federal districts. 
In addition to Vermont, the only other federal district listed on the website as vacant is the Western District of Pennsylvania. That office, like Vermont’s, is also now headed by a person with the title of first assistant U.S. attorney, according to the website.
The main difference between an acting and interim U.S. attorney revolves around how long a person can stay in the post with that title, Tobias said, with the acting title allowing for a longer period of time. 
According to federal law and rules, an interim U.S. attorney can generally serve for 120 days, while an acting U.S. attorney can generally serve for 210 days. There is no such limit for a person serving as first assistant U.S. attorney. 
It’s unclear of the exact repercussions if a person stays longer in the post than they are allowed by their title, Tobias said, and whether any cases they oversee could be invalidated.
“It has to be raised and litigated,” Tobias said, adding that there have been cases challenging the authority of specific prosecutors around the country in other federal district courts that had reached varying rulings.
The person holding the first assistant title, he said, is usually the second in command in a U.S. attorney’s office. However, Tobias said, when there is no Senate-confirmed U.S. attorney or acting or interim U.S. attorney for an office, an argument could be made that the first assistant would then be in charge since technically the top post would be vacant.
“I think that’s the kind of fast and loose stuff,” he said.
Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, could not be reached for comment.
During the last Trump administration, Christina Nolan was nominated by the president to serve as the U.S. attorney for Vermont and was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in November 2017. She left the post in 2021 following President Joe Biden’s election.
Nikolas Kerest had served as the U.S. attorney for Vermont throughout most of the Biden administration but resigned in January after Trump was elected president.

The record federal government shutdown may be over, but the dysfunction to which it gave rise and helped spur continues to plague North Carolina. Here in our state alone, millions of average people who have long relied upon government structures and services to help make basics like health care and access to food more affordable are suddenly confronting dire situations.
Whether it’s Medicaid, Affordable Care Act Marketplace health insurance policies or SNAP food assistance, recent actions of the Trump administration and its congressional allies are causing havoc for people living on the edge. What’s more, as we learned in a recent conversation with North Carolina State Senator Natalie Murdock of Chatham and Durham Counties, Republican leaders in the North Carolina General Assembly, who could be taking action to ease the confusion and suffering, have instead chosen inaction.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)The Wisconsin Elections Commission voted unanimously Monday to modify its order imposing a number of requirements on the Madison city clerk’s office due to the loss of nearly 200 absentee ballots in the 2024 election. 
In August, the commission ordered the city to make a number of changes to its election practices in an effort to prevent the loss of future ballots. 
The original order requires the city to develop an internal plan delineating which employee is responsible for statutorily required tasks, change the absentee ballot processing system so bags and envelopes aren’t lost, update instructional materials for poll workers and complete a full inspection of all materials before the scheduled board of canvassers meeting after an election. 
In a special meeting on Monday, the commission voted 6-0 to approve a request from newly appointed clerk Clerk Lydia McComas to modify a section of the order about the timing of printing and preparing poll books. 
Under the original order, Madison is required to print its poll books no earlier than the Tuesday before an election and must arrange to receive those books no later than the Friday before the election. 
McComas told the commission in a memo that the city had found a vendor that could print the poll books on the Friday before an election and deliver them by the Sunday before the election. This would allow the final printed poll books to include as many absentee ballots as possible, limiting the number of absentee ballots that are returned after the poll books are printed. 
In her memo, McComas wrote that the modification would allow the city to achieve its “shared goal” with the commission of reducing “the chance of human error.”

In an 11-page letter Monday to Steve Corsi, chief executive of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, Foley’s team alleged “ongoing financial abuse” in the personal assistance services (PAS) program that helps Medicaid-eligible Nebraskans with mobility, hygiene and housekeeping.
“Numerous PAS caregivers continue to milk the program with false, inflated and duplicate billings,” Foley said, adding that the alarm to DHHS was his office’s third since February 2024.

He said DHHS “oversight failures may, in fact, be feeding the problem — effectively setting the stage for some truly mind boggling improprieties, financial and otherwise.”
Information uncovered by the audit team was forwarded to law enforcement for review of possible legal violations.
 Energizer bunny?

In one case, the auditors said, a caregiver had been authorized to deliver 66 hours of personal assistance services a week despite holding down a full-time job as a school bus driver. Auditors identified 28 days during which the caregiver billed DHHS for performing client services at the exact times she was documented to have been driving students. 










(DHHS) oversight failures may, in fact, be feeding the problem — effectively setting the stage for some truly mind boggling improprieties, financial and otherwise.


– Nebraska State Auditor Mike Foley



In another example, Foley described a personal caregiver who billed DHHS for 70 days of client services while working full-time for a family counseling business. He said that created an “impossible scenario” of the caregiver working more than 24 hours in each of 45 days during a three-month period reviewed. 
“Some of these caregivers claim to be performing work schedules that would make the Energizer Bunny look like a slacker,” said Foley. 
That caregiver had tapped into other public programs as well, including the larger personal care services (PCS) budget and foster care. Particularly troubling to the auditor was that the caregiver in that case provided help to two adult clients who lived in her home. And one, a relative, was on the sex offender registry for having been convicted of felony sex trafficking of children in 2014. Living in the home as well, said Foley, was a 14-year-old girl in the state foster care system.
He said the caregiver appeared to have been purposefully deceitful in failing to disclose to foster care agencies that the past offender lived in the house. In seeking personal care aid, the provider reportedly claimed the relative lived in a backyard “cabin,” for which cleaning was authorized.
“When the audit team reported this bizarre and unsafe domestic arrangement, DHHS removed the foster child from the home,” Foley said.
The findings surfaced during the ongoing statewide annual audit and were reported to Corsi early due to “urgent need for corrective action,” the letter said.
For fiscal year 2025, PAS expenses totaled $10.5 million, of which the federal government covers 60% of costs and the state pays 40%. The PCS program has the same federal-state split for a much larger budget. Foley said the Monday letter aimed mostly at the PAS program.
Revelations outlined in the Monday letter were based on a review of four care providers and one 10-client agency that deals with high dollar amounts. Of the fraction reviewed, the auditing team found about $19,300 in questionable spending.
 ‘Increasingly egregious’

Another of the examples cited by Foley was a caregiver authorized by DHHS to be paid for 118 hours of service per week, split across three separate clients. Two were her parents, who did not live with her.
“This would require the provider to perform services for more than 16 hours every day of the week,” the team noted in the report, calling that authorization unreasonable.

Foley said he is convinced that a more thorough combing would lead to “a whole lot more” problems. His concern was heightened by an ongoing pattern, he said. Monday’s letter is the latest in a series of communications to DHHS over the past decade alleging potential fraud and other issues that, according to Foley, “appear to have grown increasingly egregious.”
DHHS leadership saw the findings before the public release, and included a response in the letter.
In it, agency managers said they agree with the auditor team’s recommendations to implement procedures that ensure proper payments. They also said DHHS already has taken “significant” steps to implement controls that should mitigate most of the conditions observed by auditors.
In February, for example, the Medicaid and Long-Term Care team started requiring GPS/IVR visit verification and recipient signatures to support a claim payment.
Among other actions, the Child and Family Services will work with the Nebraska State Patrol to develop an automated process that compares addresses of foster parents with the Sex Offender Registry on a quarterly basis. The system is to help ensure no offender resides at the same address as a ward of the state. 
DHHS contacts were listed as Jeremy Brussen of Medicaid and Long-Term Care and Kathleen Stolz of Child Family Services.
 No pushback

Contacted Monday, a DHHS spokesman referred to the agency’s response in the auditor’s report, reiterating that the department agreed with recommendations and was actively implementing procedures and controls to ensure proper payment for services. 
Foley said that with “all the attention” the personal assistance program has gotten, he would have expected more progress. However, he said, he is optimistic in the ability of Corsi’s DHHS, adding that his predecessor “used to fight us on everything.”
“We’re not getting any pushback,” Foley said of the agency.

The Oklahoma School Report Cards, released Monday, graded every public school in the state. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma State Department of Education has assigned the state a D grade for academic achievement in public schools but a C in learning growth for the 2024-25 school year.
The agency on Monday released its annual Oklahoma School Report Cards, which included A-F grades for each public school and for statewide averages. 
Results of state reading and math tests, the basis of the “academic achievement” category and the No. 1 factor in a school’s overall grade, came out two months ago with more rigorous scoring. A stricter definition of “proficiency” in reading and math lowered academic achievement rates across the state.
Three fewer schools received an F grade, but grades declined overall with more schools earning a D, the Education Department reported.
Only 26% of Oklahoma students scored proficient or advanced on state reading and math tests, demonstrating they met or exceeded their grade-level expectations, the report cards show. Another 37% made a basic score, indicating partial mastery of reading and math. 
In reading, 36% of students scored below basic, and 38% scored below basic in math, suggesting they have fallen significantly behind their grade level.
However, more students improved their reading and math scores from the year before. That caused the statewide academic growth score to increase by 3% and resulted in a C grade for the growth category.
Students learning English as their non-native language also showed a slight uptick in progress. The state gave itself a B for English learner progress with 34% of these students meeting their language acquisition targets.
Another statewide B grade came from college and career exposure, known as “postsecondary opportunities.” Fifty-four percent of high school juniors and seniors completed college preparatory courses like Advanced Placement, an industry certification program, a work-based internship or a college class through dual enrollment.
The state failed to meet a goal state leaders set eight years ago to achieve a 90% high school graduation rate by 2025. The report cards show only 82% of the class of 2025 graduated in four years, and 84% of the class of 2024 and 2023 completed their high school credits in five and six years, respectively.
Potentially in its final year as a core component of the state report cards, the chronic absenteeism category showed only 80.2% of public school students maintained good attendance, defined as missing less than 10% of the school year. 
The state Legislature passed a law this year to remove student absenteeism from school evaluations starting in the 2025-26 academic year, though schools with strong attendance rates could earn bonus points. The U.S. Department of Education must approve the change for it to become official.
State lawmakers decided schools shouldn’t be penalized for students’ poor attendance, a factor they said is outside of the school’s control.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — CoreCivic is looking at all options, including the possibility of applying for a special use permit from the city of Leavenworth, a company spokesman said Monday.
After a federal judge handed the private prison company a loss in court last week, the company is reassessing its stance.
“We maintain our legal position that we should be able to lawfully operate our facility, as we’ve done for almost 30 years,” said CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin. “That said, we are assessing all available avenues to find a successful conclusion to this matter for us, our stakeholders and our community, up to and including filing for the Special Use Permit.”
U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse on Tuesday dismissed CoreCivic’s request to overturn an injunction that blocks the company from housing immigration detainees immediately in its Leavenworth prison.
Now, the company is considering what Leavenworth officials asked it to do in the first place — go through the city’s development process to get a special use permit.
CoreCivic has been fighting since spring with Leavenworth to reopen its private prison without going through the city’s permitting process. But the city, citing numerous issues with the way the prison was run before it closed in 2021, said CoreCivic must file for the permit.
It’s been a winding road to get to a place of possible resolution.
When Leavenworth officials told CoreCivic the company had to go through the permit process, the two ended up in court in May. There, a judge barred CoreCivic from taking immigration detainees and fulfilling its U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract while state-level litigation was ongoing.
The federal government jumped into the fight in September, backing CoreCivic’s contention that Leavenworth is violating the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and accusing Leavenworth of “aggressive and unlawful interference.” That clause sets federal laws as supreme over state laws.
Crouse’s decision to deny CoreCivic’s request to overturn the injunction apparently was a turning point in the case.
“We’re pleased with the results,” said Leavenworth city manager Scott Peterson. “It went the way we certainly hoped it would.”
CoreCivic has said all along that it would “suffer irreparable injury” if the injunction were denied. 
The company in September signed a contract with ICE valued at $60 million a year to house migrant detainees at its Leavenworth facility, but the agreement doesn’t take effect until legal issues are resolved.
The new contract is for a fixed monthly amount and then additional payments based on the number of detainees held in the facility, which can house up to 1,033. It will not begin until the temporary injunction put in place by a Kansas district court is “no longer enforceable,” a CoreCivic news release said.
Peterson said the city is ready to continue work on the special permitting process with CoreCivic should the company decide to apply. CoreCivic had been four months into the process  when it decided to withdraw, he said. 
“We just want them to apply for a special use permit so that we can put together some standards that both parties agree to that we can hold CoreCivic to, which was something we thought we had agreed to prior to this whole situation,” Peterson said. 
“We were ready to go,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CoreCivic-MRRC-sign-1024x661.jpg,,,2025-12-01 17:57:30.442726

(Photo by Lori Duckworth/Courtesy of the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Department)OKLAHOMA CITY – The state has sued a contractor after a fire caused damage to the Sequoyah State Park lodge and restaurant.
The Office of Management and Enterprise Services on Nov. 25 sued The Lookout Kitchen, RPW ENT, LLC, and RCC Ventures LLC on behalf of the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation.
The suit was filed in Oklahoma County District Court and alleges breach of contract and negligence and seeks more than $5 million.
The tourism agency had contracted with RPW to operate and manage restaurants in six parks, including Sequoyah State Park.
On Dec. 14, a fire at the Sequoyah Lodge caused $4.5 million in damages, according to the filing.
“Investigation into the Sequoyah Lodge Fire revealed the fire originated when an RPW employee disposed of a rag containing greasy and combustible materials into a container that ultimately caught fire and spread throughout the restaurant and lodge,” the suit said.
The fire damaged substantial portions of the kitchen and hotel rooms, the suit said.
Tourism officials said in July that the lodge, which has 104 rooms, had reopened in May. In a Facebook post at the time of the fire, the local volunteer fire department said the fire had been contained to the kitchen and dining area and nobody had been injured.
The contract required the restaurant contractor to obtain insurance, which it failed to do, the lawsuit said.
A spokesperson for The Lookout Kitchen could not be reached for comment Monday.
In July, JP Wilson, the owner of The Lookout Kitchen, told Oklahoma Voice that the restaurant was insured and the damage was minimal. He said it was up to the state to reopen the restaurant, which it had not done seven months later.  
That same month, the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation announced that the restaurants in six parks were closed due to a contract dispute with The Lookout Kitchen. The restaurants reopened but closed again permanently in September.
The lawsuit marks the second time since 2022 that the state has sued a vendor it hired to run state park restaurants. 
In 2022, the agency canceled its contract with Swadley’s Foggy Bottom Kitchen and sued the company, seeking to recoup millions for breach of contract.
Swadley’s counter sued, arguing the state owes it nearly $2.6 million.
In 2024, the state’s multicounty grand jury indicted three people, including Swadley’s founder Ronald Brent Swadley, in connection with the controversial state contract to operate park restaurants. 
Swadley and the two others pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the state and five counts of presenting false or fraudulent claims against the state.
A trial is pending.

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Around 170 West Virginia National Guard members remain in the nation’s capital following the targeted shooting of Sarah Beckstrom and Andrew Wolfe blocks from the White House.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey stressed that the Guard have been there on a voluntary basis assisting with President Donald Trump’s proposed crime crackdown.
“There was never any pressure … if people wanted to stay and fulfill the mission they could,” Morrisey said Monday at the state Capitol. 
One of the shooting victims, Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died Thanksgiving Day, while the other, Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, was critically injured and remains hospitalized. Morrisey said Wolfe was able to hear and respond to a nurse, and was also able to wiggle his toes.
The governor said his administration was focused on supporting the Guard members who remain in D.C., and counseling services have been made available.
There is no known end date to the Guard members’ time in D.C., and Morrisey said there would be a periodic review of the situation to assess if people could come home for the Christmas holiday.
“I don’t think we have a specific date in mind yet,” Morrisey said. 
In August, Morrisey sent about 300 members of the state’s National Guard to D.C. at the request of the Trump administration. The remaining Guard members volunteered to remain for  the Trump administration for “Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful.” 
Beckstrom had volunteered to work during the Thanksgiving holiday, Morrisey said.
“I emphasize that these are people that knew the mission … I think the mission has been largely successful,” he said. “I wanted to make this voluntary, because anytime someone is doing that, there’s a lot of sacrifice that’s involved.”
In a news release Monday, the West Virginia Democratic Party called on Morrisey to clarify the scope and purpose of the ongoing deployment of Guard personnel to D.C., “particularly in light of multiple public reports documenting that Guard units — including those from West Virginia — have been assigned to landscaping, beautification, and trash-removal duties in the nation’s capital.”
“Respectfully, West Virginians deserve to know whether this deployment was designed primarily for public safety or whether our Guard was assigned work far outside its traditional responsibilities while putting themselves in harm’s way,” said Mike Pushkin, chair of the state Democratic Party. “The party expresses its deepest condolences to their families, friends, and fellow service members and asks all West Virginians to keep them in their prayers.”
Days before the shooting, a federal judge ordered an end to the monthslong National Guard deployment in  D.C., declaring that the use of troops was “unlawful.”
West Virginia Adjutant General Maj. Gen. Jim Seward said that after the Secretary of the Army extended Trump’s mission in D.C., the West Virginia National Guard was asked how many members they might be able to provide.
“We had our commander in D.C. survey the troops,” Seward said. 
Morrisey said that Guard members had the “background and training” to go to D.C.
Following the shooting, President Donald Trump requested 500 more National Guard members be sent to the city. West Virginia has not been asked to send additional guard members.
Morrisey also responded to reporters’ questions about why had to walk back a false social media post Wednesday afternoon that both Guard members had died in the shooting. He reversed course later that day, explaining that he’d received conflicting information. 
“When there’s a change, then you alert the public if there’s an error, you correct the error. That’s what happened, and that’s what we did. So, I won’t go into additional details at this time,” he said.
The suspected gunman in the incident, 29-year-old Afghan refugee Rahmanullah Lakanwal, will face a first-degree murder charge along with other charges.

Funeral details for Beckstrom haven’t been released. The governor ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in recognition of her death.
Trump said on Sunday that he invited Beckstrom’s family to the White House, adding that he spoke to her parents and they were “devastated.”
Morrisey asked for continued prayers for Wolfe as he remains in the hospital. 
“The family is going through a very difficult situation right now as Andrew fights to survive,” he said.

The push will also include phone calls encouraging constituents to contact their state senators to support redistricting. That chamber has been more reluctant to pursue redistricting.
The ad focuses on how California voters approved a new map favoring Democrats in the November general election.

“California carved new maps. Surgically removing Republican seats to give Democrats control of Congress and gut Trump’s agenda. Sidelining Republicans, blocking Trump’s priorities,” the ad says. 
“If Indiana does nothing, they’ll flip Congress overnight. Stopping tax cuts, letting waste, fraud and abuse pile up, and impeach Trump again. Indiana has one chance,” it continues. “Redraw the maps. Protect Hoosiers.”

An appeals court allowed Kalb to proceed with the challenge. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)LOUISVILLE — Jefferson Circuit Judge Brian Edwards once again heard arguments Monday in a three-year old court case seeking to strike down Kentucky’s abortion ban and clarify the legality of in vitro fertilization (IVF) in the state. 
Lawyers for Jessica Kalb argued that Kentucky has a patchwork of laws that could complicate their client’s ability to safely continue with the IVF process, including discarding unneeded embryos and having access to a medically-necessary abortion. 
The attorney general’s office argued that IVF is protected in state law and embryos that are not implanted in a person don’t fall under relevant homicide or abortion laws. 
Edwards initially ruled against Kalb when she was one of three Jewish women seeking to challenge Kentucky’s abortion ban on religious grounds, finding none of the women — who want to expand their families through in vitro fertilization (IVF) — had standing to challenge. 
Jewish woman’s challenge of Kentucky’s abortion ban gets green light from appeals court

An appeals court, however, found that while the other two women do not have standing, Kalb does. That ruling then sent her back to Edwards’ court, resulting in a new round of oral arguments to hash out the case. Standing is the question of whether plaintiffs’ circumstances meet legal standards entitling them to challenge the law. 
Kalb has nine frozen embryos that she’s paying to preserve and doesn’t know how she can proceed with the IVF process under the state’s restrictions on abortion and definition of life. She also canceled having an embryo implanted in 2022 because she was unclear what interventions she would have under Kentucky’s near-total ban on abortion. 
She also has polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which can cause cysts to form in the ovaries and lead to infertility. This condition also means her pregnancies are more likely to end in miscarriage and that she might need an abortion or other complicated interventions.  
After Monday’s hearing, Kalb said she still wants to grow her family, and the uncertainty around the case — which was filed in October 2022, months after the United States Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion — leaves her with many questions about how she can do that. 
“This is hard. This is always hard. I’d really like it to be not still going on,” she said. “I think that everybody here wants the same thing. We all want to be able to safely have children in Kentucky. And right now, we can’t. I can’t.” 
At 35, Kalb will be considered “geriatric” in any future pregnancy. Her risk of complications increased at this age, according to the Cleveland Clinic. 
“I think that the lawyers did a fantastic job today pointing out statutes that apply to the embryos. I still think there’s a lot of kind of skew as to focusing on the non-life that exists in those petri dishes and not focusing on the life that is here: Me, my life as a mom, my daughter who deserves to have a mom,” Kalb said. “And I think that we’re still fighting the wrong fight in some capacity. We’re not really looking at the bigger issue, which is, what is motherhood? What is being a pregnant person in the state of Kentucky right now, and how do we make that safe?”  
The arguments
Lindsey Keiser argued for the Kentucky attorney general’s office — which is named as a defendant — on Monday that Kalb “can freely engage in the conduct she desires to undertake without legal consequences or fear of prosecution” when it comes to implanting and disposing embryos. 
“IVF is a procedure, in the plaintiff’s words, to assist with pregnancy, not to terminate it, and disposing of embryos that have not been implanted is not conduct to or upon a pregnant woman,” Keiser said. “Therefore, the Human Life Protection Act prohibitions simply do not apply.”

Kalb’s lawyers, Benjamin Potash and Aaron Kemper, have argued that Kentucky, in heavily restricting abortion, has imposed and codified a religious viewpoint that conflicts with the Jewish belief that birth, not conception, is the beginning of life.
Keiser on Monday said that the idea that life begins at conception is not inherently a religious or exclusively Christian idea. 
“Not all Christians hold that idea, and there are certainly religious groups outside of Christians who hold that idea as well,” she said. 
While speaking with reporters after the hearing, Kemper said that idea sidesteps the religious freedom point. 
“I don’t want to get into an argument about what is or is not Christianity,” he said. “We know it’s not a Jewish ideal. Our clients are Jewish, and Judaism does not define life (as beginning at) conception. And that is clear.” 
Keiser did not speak with reporters after the hearing.
Jefferson Circuit Judge Brian Edwards (jeffersoncircuitcourt.com)
Keiser, representing the attorney general, argued that the appeals court ruling that gave Kalb standing on questions about the IVF process doesn’t extend to the abortion ban. For Kalb to maintain that if she became pregnant and if a complication required her to get an abortion are “speculative” claims and “not sufficiently concrete.” 
Potash said Kalb is far from asking for a “carte blanche” to do whatever she wants. She’s asking the court for a “pretty precise, limited remedy,” he said. 
As it stands now, Kemper said after the hearing, people like Kalb have a “pinky promise that they won’t prosecute” and that the attorney general is asking citizens to “‘just have faith my (successor) will be like me,’ which is just not good enough.”
Edwards ended the hearing by saying he would “get something out as quickly as possible.”
The judge, Potash said afterward, “is taking the case very seriously, and we’re going to have a sober and reflective decision from this court, and we look forward to the next steps.”

Edwards Sr. High School started celebrating academic achievement as well as congeniality for homecoming-specific titles to motivate students to excel in their academic coursework as well as extracurriculars.","Homecoming remains an important enough tradition in the Delta that the violence that happened in Leland and Rolling Fork in October didn’t diminish the crowds. Relatives still traveled home. Dozens still set up grills and canopies at games. Mississippi Today produced a collection of stories of homecoming events in the Delta, where traditions have evolved over time.
RULEVILLE — Trumpets blared through the hallways of Thomas E. Edwards Sr. High School. Three administrators, including one who was pregnant, dashed down the green-and-white tiled hallway toward the auditorium.
“What happened to the grannies with the sewing kits in their bags?” one asked, out of breath.
Homecoming Queen Jaiilah Holmes would need to make her entrance soon, but her dress was coming apart at the shoulders. The rest of the homecoming court was already announced and seated. The emcee was stalling.
Down the hall from the gym, in a classroom with algebraic equations scrawled on the white board, an administrator and a teacher were helping repair the queen’s regalia.

Jazlyn Hopkins, Jaiilah’s mother, bent in black gladiator sandals to adjust her daughter’s tiara. The teen blushed, projecting a wide smile. She shimmered in a white dress with a silver floral pattern down both sides and a bodice encrusted with imitation pearls.
Trumpeting resumed as Hopkins and a teacher trailed the queen, carrying her six-inch train. 
The gym lights flicked off. The crowd cheered.
Jaiilah emerged from behind thick curtains in a glimmering gown wired with a green light.
The house lights revealed what a party supply company billed as a Venetian masquerade scene. White construction paper covered the floor, and black palm trees framed the space. Two black thrones perched atop a raised platform where the teen royals took their seats before dozens of clear banquet chairs. Girls in black gowns wore sashes that read Miss Psychology, Miss Drug Education and Miss Algebra I.
An incentive to achieve
In the last decade, the school started celebrating academic achievement as well as congeniality for homecoming-specific titles to motivate students to excel in their academic coursework as well as extracurriculars. Now, most of the 40 categories for the homecoming court recognize excellence in an academic course, giving many students a chance to wear a sash or crown.
“It starts something big,” school resource officer Lafagus Carpenter said about how the titles motivate students. “They start feeling like they got some work to them. They start seeing what they can be.”

Nikita Foster was most proud that her son Thomas won homecoming king because of his academic performance and involvement in athletics and other activities. She adjusted the crown atop his head as he powered on his phone outside the gym. He had thick dreadlocks that wouldn’t accommodate the sparkling headwear. 
Through dual enrollment, Thomas is a high school senior and a sophomore at Mississippi Delta Community College. He hopes to enter the University of Southern Mississippi as a junior kinesiology major and, after graduating, work as an exercise scientist.
“It’s just like a sense of peace and happiness to see them grow up,” Foster said. “I’m so proud.”
Monthslong planning for a royal touch
Many homecoming attendees and title holders prepare their outfits and campaigns months in advance. Edwards High previously boasted pyrotechnics as part of the homecoming display in the gym, contracting with a local decorator who made use of her contacts.
Jazlyn Hopkins had a designer in nearby Indianola make a custom dress for her daughter. She wanted her daughter to feel “glamorous.”
By the time the designer, Chezzrae Fowler Parker, began working on Jaiilah’ dress in September, other parents started calling about her custom gowns. A photograph of a lapis dress she made for a Gentry High School senior last spring lingered in some of their minds, and on their social media timelines.

The night of homecoming, administrators connected the clasps on the flowing gold and emerald robes worn by the king, Antwan Brinkley, and Jaiilah, the queen. They initiated a dance to the R & B record, “Hey Girl.” The attendants followed the steps of a choreographed waltz.
The evening ended with speeches from the king and queen, and announcements from principal Errick Lakes.
Elementary and middle school boys in black-and-grey patterned tuxedo jackets and Venetian masks met their families outside. Blown-up photos of King Thomas and Queen Jaiilah were unfurled at the back auditorium entrance.
Parents and neighbors captured the queen’s prance down the black carpet. Their focus was kept until the last beat. When the pageant came to a close, spectators fumbled through their purses and pockets for their car keys and made the rounds of relatives and former classmates.
The Edwards High parking lot was full by the court’s last dance. Cars were parked wherever people could find a spot, sometimes diagonally in front of double parked vehicles. Some slipped out of the gym early to avoid the rush of sedans and trucks — and the possibility of a fender-bender.
One mother gave directions to a cousin unaccustomed to squeezing out of a tight parking spot. 
“It’s a town of 2,000. It never gets this packed,” she said.
The car eased out, nearly nicking a Pontiac sedan and illuminated parents and attendants with its crimson taillights. Engines roared, and teen queens in floor-length gowns lifted their hoop skirts off the dirt road home.

The state expects to receive $6 million from the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment program, a $42 billion initiative included in the infrastructure bill passed under the Biden administration. The funding will be awarded to a pair of local internet carriers, BEK and Midco, to install fiber connections to the last 279 locations in the state without access to high-speed internet. 
North Dakota would become the first state in the nation to provide 100% access to broadband internet. The final connections are expected to be completed by 2028, though it may be sooner depending on construction timelines.
The achievement will be the culmination of decades of work and investment by local carriers to create a broadband network across the state.
“We’re helping them bring in the final percent,” said Brian Newby, director of the North Dakota Information Technology’s broadband program. “The 99% was all the sweat and financial risk that they took over the last 20 years.”
The 279 locations that remain unconnected to high-speed internet as of mid-2025 are scattered across the state, though many are located near Cass County, that likely face geographic obstacles like river crossings, Newby said. 
“While we’re incredibly proud that North Dakota is widely recognized as one of the best-
connected states in the country, our main focus has always been on our citizens,” said Corey Mock, North Dakota’s chief information officer. “This approval represents a major leap forward in achieving universal connectivity.”
The milestone will mean high-speed internet access will be available as an option throughout the state. But not all North Dakotans will automatically benefit. Approximately 16% of North Dakota households do not subscribe to a broadband internet service, according to 2020 census data cited in the state’s 2023 plan for the federal funding. 
While affordability can be a factor, a National Telecommunications and Information Administration survey has shown the bulk of those who do not pay for high-speed internet access don’t see a need for it. 
Three of the North Dakota counties with the lowest broadband subscription rates as of 2023 were Benson, Sioux and Sheridan counties. 
U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., views the federal government’s approval of the funding plan to be key to the state’s future. 
“Not only does approval of North Dakota’s final proposal unlock new opportunities across the state, that’s a given, but it really opens the door to a more connected future which is everything,” Cramer said in a statement.
Cramer and Newby emphasized that much of the credit for North Dakota’s robust broadband network is owed to the local providers that have built it out over the years.
“They did a lot of personal investment, took a lot of risks, maybe as long as 20 years ago, the co-ops and the local exchange carriers, to get North Dakota to a place where they only have a few hundred left at this point,” Newby said. “We’re facilitating the funds to get to the carriers, which is very important, but it’s really not meant in any way to overshadow the huge accomplishment that they’ve done.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird announced Monday that Iowa, alongside three other states, has reached a settlement agreement allowing state officials to access a federal immigration database to verify citizenship status of voters for the next 20 years.
Bird, as well as Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, were plaintiffs in the case alongside officials from Florida, Ohio and Indiana. The lawsuit challenged the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which contains the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, for allegedly withholding information unlawfully about people registered to vote in states including Iowa that were flagged by state officials for potentially not having U.S. citizenship.
Bird celebrated the agreement as a way to ensure Iowa elections’ integrity.

“Only American citizens can vote in Iowa elections,” Bird said in a statement. “This agreement with the Trump Administration will help Iowa safeguard the integrity of our elections for years to come by preventing an illegal vote to cancel out the vote of Iowa citizens.”
Bird and Pate filed their lawsuit on this issue in December 2024, shortly after the 2024 general election. Two weeks before the Nov. 5, 2024 election, Pate issued guidance to Iowa county auditors to challenge the ballots of 2,176 registered voters who were identified by the Secretary of State’s office as potential noncitizens, as they had reported to the state Department of Transportation or another government entity that they were not U.S. citizens in the past 12 years and went on to register to vote.
Pate said the call to challenge these voters’ ballots was necessary because USCIS, under former President Joe Biden’s administration, denied the state permission to verify the citizenship status through the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database. While federal officials confirmed at a federal court hearing in 2024 there were at least 250 people registered to vote in Iowa who appeared to be noncitizens, but did not share further information with Iowa officials.
The Iowa Attorney General’s office said in a news release that DHS had told the Iowa secretary of state, “Iowa had hundreds of noncitizens on our voter rolls, but they would not tell us who they were, nor grant us access to the database that would give us the information.”
In March, Pate said his office gained access to the SAVE database and found 277 of the 2,176 people flagged to have their 2024 ballots challenged were confirmed to not have U.S. citizenship — just under 12% of the individuals identified as potential noncitizens. Voting or registering to vote as a noncitizen in U.S. elections is a felony in Iowa, punishable by up to five years in prison and fines of $750 to $7,500.
With the DHS settlement agreement, reached with the department and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem under the Trump administration, Iowa and other states will retain access to SAVE for 20 years through a binding agreement. The AG’s office wrote: “Iowa will have free access to the cutting-edge technology necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting in Iowa elections” under the agreement.
The Iowa Secretary of State’s office reported Iowa will be one of four states participating in a pilot program with DHS under the settlement, receiving “expanded access” to the SAVE database while also providing more information to the federal system through bulk uploads “which allows election officials to upload batch data, including Social Security numbers, to verify SAVE information against voter registration lists.”
According to the settlement, the state of Iowa will gain access to SAVE within 90 days of the Dec. 1 agreement, meaning the state will be able to use the database for voter citizenship verification during the 2026 primary and general elections.
During the 2025 legislative session, Gov. Kim Reynolds also signed a law allowing the Secretary of State’s office to contract with federal and state agencies as well as private entities for voter roll verification and maintenance. Pate said the law will give his office better access to tools like SAVE and other resources to verify registered voters’ eligibility to participate in Iowa elections. The measure also creates a process to set a voter’s registration status as “unconfirmed” when state or county officials have received “reliable” information that the person is not qualified to vote. It also allows registered voters to be challenged over their citizenship status at the polls.
Pate said in a statement Monday the agreement provides his office with “another layer of election integrity and protection — the ability to audit our lists and ensure only eligible voters are registered to vote and voting in Iowa elections.”
“Protecting the integrity of Iowa elections and ensuring only eligible Iowa voters participate in Iowa elections continue to be priorities of our office, as does encouraging voter participation from every eligible Iowa voter,” Pate said. “We continue to take additional steps to audit Iowa’s voter lists and verify that the information is correct and up to date. The SAVE program provides us with critical information, but we must also continue to utilize information from other state and federal partners to maintain clean and accurate lists.”

The Pride Center of Vermont, which announced in October it was closing its doors, has received a $350,000 anonymous donation that will help it reopen.
In announcing the financial contribution, the organization stated that the donation will not mean an immediate reviving of the group’s operations, but instead will allow it “breathing room” to develop and implement a sustainable path moving forward. 
The Burlington-based organization’s board of directors revealed news of the “transformation gift” in a statement last week.

“This is a pivotal moment to reimagine the Pride Center of Vermont’s future: a necessary reset to confront long-standing structural challenges, repair internal systems, and rebuild trust after years of operating in crisis mode,” the board said in the statement.
“Instead of rushing to restore the status quo,” the statement added, “we are intentionally taking this moment to design a stronger, healthier and more community-rooted organization.”
The Pride Center, one of the state’s largest organizations supporting the LGBTQ+ community, announced in October it was shutting down after 26 years, citing a lack of state and federal funding. At the time, the organization said the closure was not intended to be permanent, as the board was working to raise the roughly $350,000 it needed to resume operations.
Some community organizations have helped provide some of the support and programming the Pride Center had done in the past, such as its SafeSpace Anti-Violence Program support hotline, which continues operation at the Vermont Network.
Following news of the $350,000 anonymous donation, the Pride Center of Vermont stated it will work to address debt, invest in a comprehensive community needs assessment and develop “a strategic plan that reflects a clear vision and timeline” for when it will reopen.
“This work will take time,” the organization’s board said in its statement. “Once the new strategic framework and budget are finalized, we will announce a clear plan and timeline for reopening. In the meantime, we are committed to keeping our community informed through regular updates.”
Connor Daley, a member of the Price Center’s board, said Friday that the financial gift came through a donor-advised fund, a type of a charitable savings account that allows for giving over time while also providing certain tax advantages and anonymity protections. 
In this case, Daley said, the organization does not know the donor’s identity.
Now, Daley said, the work will begin on developing a strategy to reopen by working with stakeholders and community members to determine what kind of support and programming the organization should provide.
“The board is very intentionally not saying, ‘OK, here is our plan to reopen and bring back everything.’ We are not doing that,” Daley said. “Our first priority is saying, ‘What does the community actually want?’”

Free.,White House intensifies push for mass deportation after National Guard shooting,"Ariana Figueroa, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/white-house-intensifies-push-mass-deportation-after-national-guard-shooting,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has accelerated his drive to curb legal immigration, after a native of Afghanistan who had been granted asylum was accused in a shooting in the nation’s capital that left one member of the West Virginia National Guard dead and another in critical condition.“In the wake of last week's atrocity, it is more important than ever to finish carrying out the president's mass deportation operation,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during Monday’s press briefing. “They must go back to their home countries.”The Trump administration at the beginning of the president’s second term launched an unprecedented crackdown on all forms of immigration. The deadly shooting on the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday, in a commercial area of the District of Columbia just blocks from the White House, has intensified the push.The Department of Homeland Security in a social media post after the Wednesday attack called for immigrants to “remigrate,” which is a far-right concept in Europe that calls for the ethnic removal of non-white minority populations through mass migration.“There is more work to be done,” Leavitt said, “because President Trump believes that he has a sacred obligation to reverse the calamity of mass unchecked migration into our country.”The suspect in the guard shooting is a 29-year-old Afghan national who entered the country during the Biden administration through a special immigrant visa program for Afghan allies after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from the country in 2021. Authorities identified him as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who worked for a CIA counterterrorism operation in Afghanistan, according to the New York Times. He was granted asylum under the Trump administration earlier this year.The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia plans to charge Lakanwal with first-degree murder after one of the National Guard soldiers, U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died as a result of her injuries. Still hospitalized is U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24. Trump has indicated he intends to honor both Beckstrom and Wolfe at the White House.District officials said the shooting of guard members was “targeted,” but the motive remains under investigation. Pauses on asylumLeavitt said the Trump administration will continue “to limit migration, both illegal and legal,” after the shooting.Separately on Wednesday, the administration ended Temporary Protected Status for more than 330,000 nationals from Haiti, opening them up for deportations by February. Within hours of Wednesday's shooting, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services halted all immigration requests from Afghanistan nationals. On Thursday, USCIS head Joseph Edlow announced that by direction of Trump the agency would reexamine every green card application from “every country of concern,” which are the 19 countries on the president’s travel ban list.  And by Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio directed all U.S. embassies to suspend all visa approvals for individuals with passports from Afghanistan. Over the weekend, Trump told reporters that those pauses on asylum could last “a long time,” although it’s unclear what authority the executive branch has to suspend a law created by Congress through the 1980 Refugee Act. This is not the first time Trump has tried to end asylum this year, as there is a legal challenge to the president barring asylum seekers from making asylum claims at U.S. ports of entry.Venezuelan boat strikesDuring Monday’s press conference, Leavitt also defended the Trump administration’s continued deadly strikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela allegedly containing drugs. The attacks have been occurring since September. The president and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have stated, without evidence, that the boats’ operators are narco-terrorists and that the strikes are legal, since they have taken place in international waters. Roughly 80 people have been killed in nearly two dozen attacks since September. Leavitt disputed any questions of wrongdoing by the administration during a Sept. 2 strike, when two survivors clinging to boat wreckage were allegedly killed by a follow-on strike, as first reported by The Washington Post Friday.“President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narco-terrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war,” Leavitt said, adding that Hegseth authorized a military commander to conduct the operation.However, the attacks have raised concern among members of Congress, and following the Post story, the U.S. Senate and House Armed Services committees moved to open bipartisan inquiries into the military strikes, with a focus on the alleged follow-on attack that killed two survivors. How the National Guard wound up in the districtTrump initially mobilized 800 National Guard troops to the nation’s capital in August after claiming a “crime emergency” in the district, despite a documented three-decade low in crime.Many were instructed they would be carrying service weapons, The Wall Street Journal reported on Aug. 17. The White House effort was accompanied by a heightened U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence in the district.The mobilization then became tied up in court for months.A federal district judge in the District of Columbia found the administration’s deployment of more than 2,000 guard troops in the city illegal but stayed her Nov. 20 decision for three weeks to give the administration time to appeal and remove the guard members from the district’s streets.The guard troops had been expected to remain in the district through the end of February.The administration filed an emergency motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia for a stay to be issued on the order by Thursday. The administration filed the emergency motion the same day as the attack on the two National Guard members.Trump ordered an additional 500 guard members to the district following the shooting.The Joint Task Force District of Columbia has been overseeing guard operations in the district, including units from the district, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia.",,,,2025-12-01 16:58:27.765299

Before Edie Perkins heads out to explore a new trail, she runs through a mental checklist.Is there accessible parking? How far is it from her car to the trail? Is the surface hard-packed or uneven? For most people, those questions barely register. For Perkins, who uses a wheelchair, they determine whether she can venture out at all.
“Exploring new places is always exciting. It can also be a little frightening…there are so many things that able-bodied people don’t understand about accessing the outdoors,” she said.  
Perkins, a lifelong cyclist who lives in South Burlington, was paralyzed from the chest down in 2017 after a car hit her while she was biking. Now she uses a wheelchair or a hand-cycle on trails. Recently, she visited the Vermont Institute of Natural Science (VINS) in Quechee, a forested campus known for its treetop boardwalk and network of accessible trails. 
VINS’s trail system was improved with support from the Upper Valley Trail Alliance (UVTA), a member of the Vermont Trail Accessibility Hub (TAH). The Hub is a statewide initiative led by the Vermont Trails & Greenways Council (VTGC), and a partnership of six organizations working to expand access to trails for people of all abilities.
“We believe forest immersion is not just for the young, fit, and able-bodied. With the help of partners like UVTA, we’ve sought to make our woods accessible to all,” said Alden Smith, executive director of VINS. 
When barriers are removed, Perkins says, everything changes.“Everything at VINS felt thoughtfully designed for accessibility without losing that wild, natural feel. The paths are subtle, the views are incredible, and the experience left me grinning ear to ear…the sense of peace was exactly what I’d hoped for, ” Perkins wrote in a post she recently wrote about VINS for Trail Finder. 
More and more trail managers are hearing from their communities that they want more nature-based places where they can bring family members of all abilities. That rising demand is shaping the work ahead.


The outdoor access gap
While Vermont is rich in trails, mountains, and scenic landscapes, when the Hub launched in 2024, there was limited, incomplete information online about accessible trails.  
Trail Finder, managed by UVTA and maintained by Hub partner Community Geographics, is one of the few map-based trail databases in Vermont focused on accessibility. The free-to-use website helps trail-seekers to discover diverse, four-season trails across Vermont. 
With recent grant funding, the team has added or improved descriptions and maps for over 60 trails covering 125 miles, and continues to add routes of all types, from rail trails to adaptive mountain biking. Website users can click the “Access(ible) Experience” search filter to find trails that offer greater levels of access. 
“Trail managers regularly contact the Hub and UVTA for help understanding how to update their trails,” Russell Hirschler of UVTA said, “The steady flow of inquiries shows that communities want to make improvements; they just need guidance to do it well.”
It’s critical work, as Vermont Department of Health data shows one in four residents has a disability, and nearly 28 percent are over age 60, making Vermont the fourth-oldest state in the country. 
Hub partner Vermont Adaptive has seen a 350% increase in demand for its inclusive sports and recreational programming over the past decade. 
Expanding accessible trails isn’t just about recreation; it’s about community health, inclusion, and quality of life for everyone, from parents with strollers to older adults and people recovering from injury. 
“When we talk about trails, we’re really talking about people,” says Sharon Plumb, program manager for VTGC. “Who gets to be here? Who feels welcome? What can we do to say yes to more people?”

A statewide movement to make trails welcoming for all
As awareness of accessibility needs has grown, funders are increasingly taking notice. 
In 2024, the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation’s Vermont Outdoor Recreation Economic Collaborative (VOREC) introduced an “Equity” track to its Community Grant Program, awarding grants to nine municipalities and organizations focused specifically on improving trail accessibility. Program staff say they’ve also seen an uptick in applications seeking funding to build or upgrade accessible trails.
A VOREC Community Grant supported the Hub from June 2024 through December 2025. The $644,000 award, the largest grant VOREC has ever issued, helped expand accessibility work statewide. VOREC administers Vermont’s federal Recreation Trails Program (RTP), aligning national funding with local priorities.
Since 2024, the Hub has completed 55 trail accessibility assessments with more than 30 organizations to evaluate pedestrian, aquatic, and adaptive mountain biking routes. These assessments identify the specific improvements needed to enhance access or meet established accessibility standards.
The appetite for this technical support continues to grow. When the Vermont Land Trust hosted an accessible trail-building training at Pratt Refuge in Duxbury in fall 2025, 15 trail managers attended, some traveling more than an hour, to learn directly from Hub partners about design, maintenance, and assessment. Interest in trainings like this routinely exceeds capacity, underscoring the level of guidance communities are seeking.
“The enthusiasm and support we’ve received from TAH has helped keep accessibility as a priority for our organization,” said Jenna O’Donnell, executive director of the South Hero Land Trust. With recommendations from an assessment funded by TAH, the group recently updated its Recreation Park with a new boardwalk and plans to upgrade additional trails for accessibility by 2026.
Across Vermont, this work is reshaping familiar places, many funded by VOREC’s Community Grant Program. Accessible routes now exist or are in progress at several Vermont Land Trust-owned properties, including Brewster Uplands in Cambridge and Pratt Refuge in Duxbury. 
Projects with Vermont Huts & Trails at Chittenden Brook in the Green Mountain Forest near Rochester and the newly acquired Historic Goodell House at Little River State Park in Waterbury will add accessible overnight and day-use options. 
Towns like Lunenburg and Randolph, along with groups such as Northwoods Stewardship Center and Tucker Mountain Forest, are advancing new pedestrian trail designs.With support from Hub partners, including The Vermont Mountain Bike Association and The Northern Forest Canoe Trail, upgrades are being made to dozens of mountain biking trails and aquatic access points.
 Russ Hirschler and Randy Richardson of UVTA meet with South Hero Land Trust Executive Director Guy Maguire and UVM Intern Lilian Mae Olson to decide what can be done to improve the Rec Park trail in South Hero. 
Building accessibility with, not for
The Hub’s success stems from collaboration and the idea of “building accessibility with, not for.” 
People with disabilities are more than test users; they’re leaders, assessors, and storytellers. The Hub has paid adaptive athletes to help review trails and share firsthand experiences through case studies, audio stories, and webinars.
New Hub resource pages provide detailed information on how to build accessible pedestrian trails, mountain biking trails, and aquatic entry points, along with their benefits. 
At the recent Vermont Conference on Parks, Trails, and Recreation, 15 accessibility workshops featured partners including the Vermont Center for Independent Living, adaptive athletes, and a deaf trail and conservation crew.
Trail managers across the state say that without the Hub’s assessments, trainings, and technical support, they wouldn’t have the confidence or the capacity to move accessibility projects forward.
“The TAH provides important resources to groups who are eager to take the next step,” said Jeff Nugent of the Windham Regional Commission. “It informs them as to what’s possible when it comes to improving their trails, and how it can be done.”

A future where everyone can get outside more
Momentum is growing. Trail managers and disability advocates are collaborating more closely than ever before, and interest in accessibility assessments continues to exceed capacity.
Many communities now have accessibility upgrades in their long-term trail plans specifically because they’ve worked with the Hub or attended a TAH-led training.
For Vermonters like Derek Flint, who is blind, progress means more places are opening up to him and his family.
“It feels like a sense of freedom being on a trail that is safe and not having to worry about falling off some steep inclines,” Derek said of the trails upgraded through the Hub partners. “Thank you for all you have done and will do in the future.”

StebbinsAs Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge continues to seek final approval to begin construction of a tunnel project intended to replace an exposed section of pipeline running through the Great Lakes, environmentalists gathered on Monday to share a report detailing how much the line’s failure could cost Michigan taxpayers. 
Oil and Water Don’t Mix, a coalition of organizations committed to securing a shutdown of the Line 5 dual pipelines running through the Straits of Mackinac, where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet, collected multiple analyses from over the past nine years into a single document to highlight the risks and potential costs of an oil spill.
Line 5 transports up to 22.68 million gallons of crude oil and natural gas liquids through the Straits of Mackinac each day, with one University of Michigan researcher pointing to the region as the worst place for a Great Lakes Oil Spill. 
“The proposed Line 5 tunnel is not just an environmental risk, but it’s a massive financial threat to the people of Michigan” Sean McBrearty, the campaign coordinator for Oil and Water Don’t Mix, told reporters.
Risk-Report-Line-5
 
While arguments against the tunnel project have largely been focused on the environmental impacts, McBrearty said the conversation has not addressed the costs taxpayers could face should the tunnel fail.
After gaps in the pipelines’ protective coating were discovered in 2014, Enbridge would reach an agreement with the state to build a utility tunnel beneath the lakebed aimed at containing any potential oil spills.
However, the report points to language in the 2018 agreement between Enbridge and the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority, created by former Gov. Rick Snyder to oversee the construction of the tunnel, noting the authority will “accept ownership of the Tunnel.”
“Ownership can be transferred to the state of Michigan through the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority,” McBrearty said. “That means that Michigan taxpayers, not Enbridge, could be responsible for the catastrophic … cleanup, water system repairs, tourism losses, public health emergencies and multibillion dollar infrastructure disruptions if something goes wrong.”










The proposed Line 5 tunnel is not just an environmental risk, but it's a massive financial threat to the people of Michigan.


–  Sean McBrearty, the campaign coordinator for Oil and Water Don’t Mix


Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy also pointed to the tunnel agreements, noting that the company has agreed to “defend, indemnify, protect and hold harmless the Authority and the State of Michigan, and all of its officers, officials, agents, contractors providing expert advice to the [Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority], and employees” from any liability tied to the design, operation or maintenance of the tunnel and the replacement pipeline segment housed within. 
“The bottom line is this: Enbridge takes full responsibility and pays for all costs related to any incident anywhere along our system. Under the terms of our easement, the State of Michigan is fully indemnified from any costs associated with our operations,” Duffy said in a statement. “The 2018 agreements with the State also require us to maintain the financial tools and resources necessary to cover incident response and clean-up costs, and we certify our financial strength to the State of Michigan.”
However, the report raises questions about Enbridge’s ability to cover the cost of a major spill, pointing to a 2019 analysis by American Risk Management Resources Network, LLC on behalf of the Department of Attorney General, Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.
As of August 2019, Enbridge’s Canadian parent company, Enbridge Inc. had the financial resources to cover $1.87 billion in damages tied to a Line 5 oil spill, with the analysis placing that “on the low end” of the potential cost of a major release.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, the analysis advises against accepting the parent company’s assets as proof of financial assurance, noting that only the company’s subsidiaries – Enbridge Energy, Limited Partnership, Enbridge Energy Company, Inc. and Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. – are signatories on the agreement, and subject to the indemnity agreement. 
Should these subsidiaries go bankrupt, taxpayers are left to foot the bill, Oil and Water Don’t Mix argues in the report. 
Additionally, Enbridge’s liability insurance covers $940 million, the report notes, while the federal oil spill trust fund covers $1 billion, leaving the state to cover at least $3.6 billion when using a 2018 projection from Michigan State University’s Institute for Public Policy and Social Research, which places the damage from a Line 5 oil spill at $5.6 billion. 
“The worst case scenarios are far more costly,” McBrearty said. “Up to $45 billion has been identified in economic losses if the straits shipping channel shuts down. Nearly $5 billion in tourism losses alone have been identified. Hundreds of millions in water system shut down and emergency public health impacts. Decades of environmental cleanup and restoration, and all of this is before we even consider a tunnel failure which Michigan, not Enbridge, would own.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DSC_0161-4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-01 16:58:27.765299

Burkman and Wohl were initially charged with actions aimed at suppressing the vote during the 2020 general election. The no contest pleas and the subsequent sentencing agreement were hashed out by the defendants’ attorneys and the Wayne County 3rd Circuit Court.
The Department of Attorney General was not involved in the agreement.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel on Monday, in a statement, said that Burkman and Wohl engaged in conduct that “used every racist dog whistle – fear of incarceration, fear of the government and fear of one’s benefits being taken away – to steal the most fundamental right that we often take for granted: the right to vote.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“While on probation, if they engage in these types of criminal behaviors, they will be held to account here in Michigan,” Nessel said. “We all are aware, and this court has made these defendants aware, that continuing to engage in criminal conduct while on probation is a violation, for which the department will be ever vigilant about bringing to the attention of their probation agents and this court. If they willingly choose to engage in the types of repulsive behaviors they have gained notoriety for, this court and my department will be watching.”
Burkman and Wohl, the department said, attempted to discourage voters from participating in the general election by creating and funding a robocall targeting specific and multiple urban areas across the country, including Detroit. A news release said the calls were made in late August 2020, sent to nearly 12,000 residents with phone numbers registered to an address with a Detroit ZIP code.
Among the falsehoods the pair promoted were: misinformation about voting by mail, saying the practice could place voters’ personal information in a public database that would be used by police departments to track down individuals with outstanding warrants; that a public database would be used by credit card companies to collect outstanding debts; and that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would use vote by mail records to track individuals for mandatory vaccines.
In doing so, the calls also identified Burkman and Wohl as the source of the disinformation. The two activists, one of whom had close ties to the 2016 and 2020 campaigns of President Donald Trump, also claimed they were the founders of a civil rights organization called Project 1599. The robocall messages sent during the election included a call to predominantly Black residents to not be “finessed into giving your private information to the man. Stay safe and beware of vote by mail.”

Nessel’s office filed charges against the pair in 2020, and both were bound over for trial. A motion to quash the charges was denied, and the case was appealed up to the Michigan Supreme Court.
The state’s high court eventually remanded the case to the Michigan Court of Appeals, which determined that the alleged conduct met the statutory and constitutional thresholds to keep the charges intact.
The Michigan Supreme Court kicked it once more back to the lower court following that decision, but declined to hear it a final time once the state Court of Appeals narrowly tailored the charges as to not ensnare constitutional free speech protections.

That chain of events led to the plea agreement and the probation sentence.
Burkman and Wohl agreed to plead no contest to single counts of intimidating voters, conspiracy to commit an election law violation, using a computer to intimidate voters, and using a computer to commit a conspiracy.
Michigan was not the only state where Burkman and Wohl faced charges.
In New York, Burkman and Wohl reached a settlement with the state’s attorney general’s office in 2024 to pay up to $1.25 million targeting thousands of Black voters in New York during the 2020 election.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Criminals who persuade children to harm or sexually abuse animals could face up to five years in prison under a new bill filed with the support of Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Sponsored by Democrat Sen. Kristen Arrington and Republican Rep. Linda Chaney, the identical SB 676 and HB 559 would create a third-degree felony charge for Floridians who either abuse animals in front of children or encourage children to do the same. 
That could include bestiality, forcing animals to fight, or harming them. Third-degree felonies are punishable by up to five years in prison, up to $5,000 in fines, or a combination of both. 
The legislation would create a new pattern of penalties for adults who use “any act that causes, tends to cause, encourages, or contributes” to a child committing an offense. So, an adult who assists a minor convicted of a third-degree felony would be charged with a first-degree misdemeanor, a second-degree felony with a third-degree felony, and so on.
DeSantis first hinted at these proposed additions to Florida’s animal cruelty statute last week at a press conference at Big Dog Ranch, a Loxahatchee animal rescue site where he’d previously signed two other pro-animal bills into law.
“There are some bad actors who keep these animals in inhumane conditions and we want to put an end to that type of practice in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said. “The mission is, you legislators, churn this out and then we’ll set a date to come back here and … then we’ll do an even bigger celebration.”
He referred to both Chaney’s and Arrington’s measures as well as another, yet-to-be-filed bill cracking down on inhumane dog breeders. 
During the 2025 session, lawmakers overwhelmingly passed the two anti-animal cruelty bills that DeSantis signed into law at Big Dog Ranch.
Trooper’s Law, named after a Bull Terrier nicknamed “Trooper” by Florida Highway Patrol, makes it a third-degree felony to restrain and abandon a dog outside during a natural disaster. Trooper was found tied to a Tampa fence ahead of Hurricane Milton as floods rushed in. Animal cruelty charges were dropped against his former owner for lack of evidence of intent.
Dexter’s Law lengthens prison sentences for Floridians who torture, mutilate, or kill pets. This came after Dexter, a bulldog mix, was found decapitated and dumped in St. Petersburg.

Maura Healey as consistent with the state’s “high expectations” for all students.
Passing the tests would not be a condition of receiving a diploma, as it was under the former “high stakes” MCAS system, but a major teachers union said the proposal still “defies the will of the voters” in 2024.
Voters in 2024 approved a ballot law to eliminate the MCAS graduation requirement. The K-12 Statewide Graduation Council that Gov. Maura Healey formed through an executive order in January was charged with advising the governor and Legislature on the development of a statewide graduation requirement. 
“I said a year ago that we were going to work together to create a new model for students in Massachusetts, a new vision that sets every high school student up for success, and today we’re speaking to that. Because here in our state, we don’t turn away from students, and we don’t back down from high expectations,” Healey said at a press conference at Dedham High School on Monday.
Initial recommendation documents released by the council on Monday include a “demonstration of mastery” that has two components: exams administered by the state, taken at the end of courses; and capstones or portfolios that are designed, administered and scored locally.
In addition to proving “mastery,” other recommendations include requiring that students complete a “rigorous program of study that aligns with the admissions requirements for higher education,” developing and maintaining an individual career and academic plan, completing federal or state financial aid forms, developing financial literacy skills, and having the option to earn state-designed seals of distinction.
The state is searching for new standards after voters detached the MCAS exam from diploma eligibility. Critics said the high stakes exam caused teachers to teach to the test while supporters said tests are the best way to ensure educational consistency and equity across the state.
Healey was joined in Dedham by Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll, Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler, Education Commissioner Pedro Martinez and American Federation of Teachers of Massachusetts President Jessica Tang. The Massachusetts Teachers Association, which led the ballot question effort against the MCAS graduation requirement, does not endorse the recommendations.
The end-of-course assessments would be administered at the end of specific high school courses, like Algebra I, English Language Arts, Science and Social Studies. “The recommendation for end-of-course assessments functions alongside the recommended program of study,” the recommendation document says.
“Research on EOC assessments specifically has found that EOC assessments are generally positively correlated with high school graduation rates, with the impacts of Math and English Language Arts EOC assessments being statistically significant,” the document says. “Additionally, administering a greater number of EOC assessments generally correlates with higher graduation rates.”
A press release from the governor’s office says the end-of-course assessments “are different from high stakes testing because students do not have to pass an EOC to graduate. EOCs will be a more targeted and relevant approach to assessment than our current high school MCAS.”
The 100-page recommendation document is due to be followed by the council’s final report in June 2026. The recommendations require legislative action after they are filed, according to the Executive Office of Education. July is the last month for scheduled formal legislative sessions in 2026.   
“The administration is assessing the best way to approach implementation,” said EOE spokesperson Alana Davidson.
Over the next six months, the council will discuss which courses should have an assessment, the weight and role of the tests as a component of a system that determines readiness to graduate, and accommodations and alternative formats for students with disabilities, English learners and newly-arrived immigrant students.
The council’s report also outlines the purpose behind redesigning the graduation framework. Co-chairs Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler and K-12 Commissioner Pedro Martinez wrote that the post-MCAS transition offers Massachusetts “an opportunity to update what it means to graduate from a public high school… prepared for today’s workforce and postsecondary education opportunities.”
“What we’re releasing today,” Tutwiler said, “is an initial framework, a starting point. It outlines the importance of coursework, offers more opportunities for students to demonstrate their learning in ways that reflect their strengths, and supports them in planning the next chapter of their lives.”
The report frames the effort as a response to concerns about inconsistent expectations across districts and says a uniform statewide requirement is intended to support “rigorous, uniform, and equitable” standards for all students. It further situates Massachusetts’ work within national trends. A review of other states’ graduation requirements found growing use of flexible pathways, mastery-based demonstrations, and combinations of coursework and performance tasks.
The council wrote that a statewide requirement supports “mobility, consistency, accountability, and transparency” for students and families, and argues that a Massachusetts diploma should signal that graduates are well-prepared for college, career and civic life.
Brooke Thomson, president and CEO of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, said the business group supports the standards.
“Massachusetts’ economic future depends on a strong and measurable education system. Ensuring that all students meet clear and standardized expectations in core subjects is critical not only for their own success, but for the long-term competitiveness of our state,” Thomson said. “AIM urges parents, employees, and employers to engage in this work in supporting this vital set of recommendations to ensure Massachusetts remains a leader in educating our children and our future workforce.”
Though the governor’s advisory said union officials were joining Monday morning’s press conference, the Massachusetts Teachers Association — the largest teachers union in the state — said they are not endorsing the recommendations. 
“By making new state standardized tests a central component of the new graduation requirements, the proposal defies the will of voters who made clear their wishes in the 2024 Question 2 referendum, which passed by nearly 60 percent in favor,” MTA President Max Page and Vice President Deb McCarthy said in a statement.
Healey shot back at the union.
“Let me be perfectly clear, the end-of-course assessments are not a high-stakes test. They’re not. So that’s an inaccurate characterization by the Massachusetts Teachers Association,” Healey told reporters in Dedham. “What the end-of-course assessments are, are basically the tests you take normally at the end of your course… That gives us the opportunity to assess how much the students learned, whether the right kind of progress has been made.”
Though the union is represented on the council, they say members “did not vote on the recommendations; these are the recommendations of the secretary and commissioner, speaking on behalf of the Healey administration.”
Tang, representing the second largest teacher’s union in the state, stood by the governor’s side for the unveiling of the recommendations in Dedham. 
“This is a starting point,” Tang said. “Our hope is that the final recommendations accurately reflect what we know residents want: a better secondary school graduation system that moves away from high-stakes testing as well as over testing. There is an opportunity here to create a better system that authentically reflects and supports the current educational needs of our students, including a focus on deeper learning, critical thinking, life long learning and preparedness for college, vocation, and career.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Yes-on-2-Max-Page-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C793&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-01 15:58:33.787770

“Compassion is strength, not weakness,” Guckian, told the crowd of supporters gathered at Brewed Awakenings Coffee House in Warwick Monday morning. “That’s the Rhode Island I believe in, one where families can afford to live and work, where compassion meets common sense, and where every child growing up here, the American Dream is still within reach right here in the Ocean State.”

Don Carcieri. 
Throughout his kickoff speech Monday, Guckian frequently invoked his former State House boss and mentor Carcieri, who led the state for two terms from 2003 to 2011 and was the last Republican to hold the governor’s seat in Rhode Island. 
Like Carcieri, Guckian espoused a message of fiscal responsibility, calling for the state to rein in spending and get rid of burdensome taxes and fees on small businesses and residents. But the familiar GOP talking points were married with moderate takes on mental health care, housing and renewable energy, reflecting Guckian’s personal experience and breadth of professional roles. 
Indeed, it’s hard to find a sector Guckian hasn’t touched, from his background as an opera singer and music teacher at North Kingstown High School, to several stints in banking, as fundraising head for the Rhode Island Foundation, and, most recently, executive director for the Rhode Island Dental Association. He recently stepped down from the leadership role representing dental providers and promoting access to care after nearly three years.
Guckian ran for lieutenant governor in 2022, losing to Democratic incumbent Sabina Matos by eight percentage points in the general election.
Reflecting back on his failed state office bid four years ago, Guckian said he started too late — a mistake he hopes to avoid this time by launching his campaign earlier.
“It was like ‘Rocky 1,’ and I want to get to ‘Rocky 2,’” Guckian said, referring to the first two films in the fictional franchise of boxer Rocky Balboa.
Guckian is also looking to grow his campaign finance account — which held about $2,000 as of his most recent filing in January —- by taking advantage of a state law that offers matching public funds to general officer candidates who raise money on their own and agree to spending caps. 
The 1988 law, adjusted at the start of each year by the state elections board, lets general office candidates receive taxpayer-funded matches for up to 20% of the total amount raised, providing they meet conditions around minimum donor numbers, among other requirements. 
“I think I can raise the money to be competitive, and once you get the match, then it all has to do with the person’s heart, soul, conviction, and who they are as a candidate, and I know that I will resonate with the state of Rhode Island, because people want change,” Guckian said.

The competition 
Gov. Dan McKee and Helena Buonanno Foulkes, the two most prominent declared Democratic gubernatorial candidates and 2022 rivals have been actively fundraising for nearly a year. As of Sept. 30, Foulkes had $2.4 million cash on hand in her campaign account, while McKee ended the reporting period with $1 million, according to reports filed with the Rhode Island Board of Elections. 
Gregory Stevens, who owns the trio of local Pat’s Italian Restaurants, also filed his paperwork to run as a Democrat earlier this month, according to news reports.  
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, widely speculated as a fourth potential Democratic candidate for governor though he has not confirmed it, remains the top fundraiser of any state official, with $4.2 million cash on hand.
McKee’s campaign took aim at Guckian in a statement ahead of the event on Monday.
“Aaron Guckian is back with the same tired Republican playbook that would turn Rhode Island into a testing ground for Donald Trump’s agenda,” McKee’s campaign said. “While he will continue to push the same Trump economic agenda that is raising the cost of living in Rhode Island, Governor McKee is focused on what actually matters: lowering costs for families, strengthening our public schools, and keeping Rhode Island’s economy moving forward. Governor McKee will put his record of real results up against Aaron Guckian or any Trump-aligned Republican who intends to run.”
Jon Romano, a spokesperson for Foulkes’ campaign also issued a statement but did not name Guckian at all. 
“As we face an increasingly chaotic and unpredictable Trump administration in Washington — Rhode Island needs a strong Democratic governor now more than ever,” Romano said. “We need a governor who will address our housing affordability crisis, bring down costs for working families, protect our rights and values, and provide the steady, competent leadership our state deserves.”
Guckian also faces competition from within his own party. Retired comedian Elaine Pelino quietly unveiled a campaign website in July. Local businessman Robert Raimondo, a distant cousin of former Gov. Gina Raimondo, filed his candidacy paperwork in November. Neither has held a formal kickoff events or promoted their campaigns to the press.
Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz and 2022 Republican gubernatorial candidate Ashley Kalus are also rumored to be mulling a run for governor. Guckian said he had not spoken with Kalus since her 2022 campaign. He called de la Cruz a “good friend,” and said she had not indicated to him that she planned to run for governor.
A spokesperson for de La Cruz did not respond to inquiries for comment on Monday.
Guckian drew several big names in the state GOP to his campaign kickoff, including GOP Chairman Joe Powers, former Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Bob Flanders and David Levesque, coffee shop owner and co-founder of the new political action committee, The League of RI Businesses. Cranston Mayor Ken Hopkins introduced Guckian to the crowd Monday.
“His commitment to public service is not just a political ambition,” Hopkins said. “It’s a calling. He knows that every decision that we make impacts our neighbors, our friends and our families.”

‘Get up and grind’
Guckian emphasized his humble beginnings as the son of a plumber and respiratory therapist who instilled in him the value of hard work, even when it requires long hours.
“You got to get up and grind,” Guckian said. 
The grind mentality is what Guckian sees as missing now, both from state leaders and the state’s overall attitude. 
“People love to talk about problems” he said. “They love to run to Twitter. They love to say, ‘Oh, this is the problem, but how are we going to get to the solution?’ And it’s very simple. You get people in the room, you tell them, how can we do better? And you remove obstacles. And ladies and gentlemen, that’s what I do every single day.”
Guckian pointed to his track record leading the state dental trade group as evidence of his ability to work across the aisle and achieve results, including increasing Medicaid fees paid out for dental work and a state review at provider reimbursement rates. Guckian also helped to influence Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha’s directive to use the bulk of an $11 million state settlement with Route 6/10 Interchange contractor Barletta Heavy Division to pay for dental care for children in underserved neighborhoods of Providence.
His rousing speech grew somber as Guckian explained his own battles with health care challenges, specifically the difficulty of getting sober. He did not elaborate on his sobriety, but stressed the need to prioritize addiction treatment and mental health care.
Guckian repeatedly steered focus back to state issues despite repeated reporters’ questions about his view on President Donald Trump and the national Republican agenda. 
But, Guckian acknowledged that he did not agree with the Trump administration’s halt to work on the Revolution Wind project this summer — reversed a month later under a federal judge order. And on social issues like gay marriage and abortion, Guckian said he would not reverse the protections already enshrined in state law.
“You have to have a bipartisan spirit,” Guckian said. “You have to work with the legislature. You have to not always talk about the things that you disagree with, but what do you agree with?”
Guckian gave a measured response when asked about firing McKee’s cabinet members, specifically Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr. and Rhode Island Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education Angélica Infante-Green. The former faces public scrutiny for his handling of the Washington Bridge collapse and rebuild and the latter for student performance in Providence schools.
Guckian understood the frustrations over the continued traffic delays created by the bridge rebuild, but said it was too soon to commit to firing anyone. But, he said he would do a “hard analysis,” agreeing that “things are not going well” with state traffic and infrastructure work generally.
He also pledged to find unspecified “efficiencies” in state government to help reduce costs and burdens on taxpayers, while also incorporating “modern technology” to better serve people. But not, Guckian cautioned, at the expense of jobs. He stressed the need to bolster workforce training programs, collaborate with unions, and support frontline workers like health care providers through student loan reimbursement programs and other incentives.
On housing, Guckian backed the move to reduce local permits and red tape stymieing affordable housing, the same strategy championed by Shekarchi, though Guckian said  he did not believe in state mandates.
While Guckian might be the underdog in experience in state office, he’s not small in stature. “Think BIG” is Guckian’s campaign slogan, a literal nod to his towering 6-foot-7 frame.
A campaign rally for Guckian is scheduled for 6 p.m. Monday, also at Brewed Awakenings in Warwick.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)In a rare moment in Virginia’s legislative history, the Senate on Monday invited higher education leaders from the University of Virginia and Virginia Military Institute to speak in an open forum about how they are choosing their institutions’ leaders, and why UVA opted to sign a controversial agreement with the federal government to suspend civil rights investigations. 
Monday’s meeting comes as lawmakers are preparing to return to Richmond in January to develop the state’s next two-year budget that would include state funding to support Virginia’s colleges and universities’ operations and capital projects. The schools’ decisions raised alarms among lawmakers, who are charged with financially supporting the institutions and appointing governing board members. For months, Democratic legislators have expressed concern about federal overreach at Virginia’s universities. 
Senate Appropriations Subcommittee Chair on Higher Education Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, highlighted the stakes of the situation at Monday’s gathering, saying Virginia’s nationally ranked institutions have been one of the key drivers of the state’s success.
“They are one of the biggest components for the commonwealth, scoring highly on being the best state for business,” said Locke. “However, there have been recent actions at multiple institutions by their board members that could endanger the world-class nature of these institutions.”

Those actions could have both “direct and indirect financial impact,” Locke said. The meeting came as several Democratic lawmakers remain locked in a lawsuit over their rejection of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s appointees to the governing boards at UVA, VMI and George Mason University, which they said was an attempt to block the politicization of the universities’ governing bodies.
Here are five takeaways from Monday’s meeting.
 Interim President stands by UVA-DOJ agreement

UVA Interim President Paul Mahoney continued to defend the school’s agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to suspend seven investigations into the institution. The DOJ claimed UVA’s admissions, hiring, diversity, equity, and inclusion programs violated federal civil rights laws, and that its campus culture was inhospitable to Jewish students. 
While UVA leaders rejected the claims, the federal government’s investigation is part of a broader effort by President Donald Trump’s administration to align colleges and universities with its views and crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.
Some lawmakers, mostly Democrats, alumni and faculty opposed the agreement and said it opened the school up to legal liability conflict with existing law, and infringed on state sovereignty.

Still, Mahoney said, the agreement suspends costly and disruptive investigations and preserves institutional autonomy and academic freedom.
“For all of those reasons, I believe that signing the agreement was the best option available to us. In fact, we are in a clearly better position than if we hadn’t signed.”
Mahoney said that of the seven investigations, five have been suspended. Two of them were closed.
Lawmakers also questioned Mahoney about the agreement’s consequences. 
Compared to other institutions, UVA will not have to invest any money like Cornell or repay any money to the federal government Northwestern University. But senators wanted to know if there were other strings attached to the UVA-DOJ deal that put the investigations on ice, and questioned the efficacy of the federal department.
“I find it disappointing that institutions have been bullied into capitulating to the Department of Justice,” Locke said, “and I find the word ‘justice’ also moronic in this day and age, because that department is certainly rogue these days, and I certainly take issue with the idea of ‘seasoned investigators’ coming out of that department, because that’s a very toxic environment that’s operating there now, because many of the seasoned individuals have been fired or left of their own accord.”
 UVA’s presidential search won’t be impacted by the federal investigations

Mahoney doesn’t expect the issues surrounding the institutions to negatively impact UVA’s search for the next president.
Quoting Issacson, Miller, the firm advising UVA on the search, Mahoney said every institution has its own challenges but now that there is an agreement in place, the uncertainty about the number and quality of candidates has diminished. 
“The search firm stated that there was a surge of very high-quality applications right after that agreement was signed, so I am not persuaded that we will not receive high-quality applications,” Mahoney said. “Obviously, the search is confidential. I have no way of knowing who is or isn’t a candidate, but at least the search consultant has expressed confidence that we are receiving high quality applications.”

Last month, Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger asked UVA leaders to suspend their search for a new president until vacant seats on the governing board are filled and confirmed, likely in the upcoming legislative session. Spanberger said the board members “severely undermined” the public’s confidence in their abilities amid the agreement with the DOJ.
Youngkin, who is term-limited, said UVA should not delay its decision and characterized Spanberger’s request as an improper attempt to interfere with the hiring process and an incorrect depiction of board members’ efforts.
“It’s dangerous to wrongfully disparage committed individuals who volunteer to serve on university boards and the serious work they do,” Youngkin wrote in a letter in November. “Further, the governor of the commonwealth should speak thoughtfully and honor the service of those individuals.”
 UVA rectors are a no-show

Rachel Sheridan and Porter Wilkinson, the rector and vice rector of the UVA Board of Visitors, were not present at the meeting, although their names appeared on the initial agenda last week.
Jim Ryan, former UVA president, recently wrote that the two worked with the Department of Justice and Youngkin’s office to pressure him to resign. The governor’s office has not responded to earlier questions from the Mercury on the matter.
Locke said there are plans to invite them to a future meeting before the start of the next session. Other institutions may also be invited as well. The committee did not provide a date. 
 Senators meet new VMI superintendent

Senators also met newly appointed Virginia Military Institute Superintendent Lt. General David Furness Monday, who provided an update on institutional leadership and finances.
Senators questioned Furness about his working relationship with the institution’s governing board, which is appointed by the governor and confirmed by the General Assembly, like all public university boards in the state. He was appointed in August.
“Well, they are my, what I would refer to as my higher headquarters,” Furness said. “They’re appointed by the governor, confirmed by the legislature, and they’re going to direct me and the daily prosecution of my duties.”

Furness stated that he is accountable to the board for fiscal matters, good order, discipline, and daily operations, and that he maintains regular communication with the board president and members. 
He highlighted the board’s significant representation of VMI alumni, noted the importance of balancing tradition with change, and described his approach as “open” in his engagement with board members, seeking consensus and keeping them well-informed to ensure strong governance while advancing VMI.
Furness replaced former Ret. Major Gen. Cedric Wins, the first Black superintendent who was ousted by the governing board earlier this year. Since the decision, the governing board has made significant changes to its bylaws and modified the board’s responsibilities relating to diversity and inclusion.
 Institutions make legislative and funding pitches

In another segment of the meeting, Virginia’s higher education leaders provided an overview of budget requests and their legislative priorities ahead of the upcoming General Assembly session. The presentations come at a time when public perceptions of the value of a college education have greatly declined, prompting lawmakers to consider ways to support institutions facing uncertainty in enrollment.
“My read of the data is that higher education has never been more valuable than it is right now,” said State Council of Higher Education for Virginia Executive Director A. Scott Fleming, adding, “students who have not earned a credential, post-secondary credential, are struggling much more in the current workforce than those who have.” 
Council of Presidents Chair and President Troy Paino added that he believes access to and completion of college is vital, particularly for low-income and Pell-eligible students.
Paino, who is also the president of the University of Mary Washington, said financial barriers are the primary reasons students are not graduating, and that expanding support is essential moving forward.
The two leaders advocated for continued and increased state investments for operations, student financial aid, workforce development and capital projects.
“We have a significant responsibility in crafting those budgets,” said Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, who spoke with reporters after the meeting. “We, by all accounts, are going to have a challenging budget environment coming up, and more information is always better than less. There’s an awful lot that is on our plate right now, and hearing from SCHEV and from the Council of Presidents and from these two institutions was certainly important.”

(Getty photo by Coral222)No matter what a federal advisory committee recommends later this week, the Rhode Island Department of Health on Monday reasserted the state’s commitment to preserving continued access to the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns.
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is scheduled to discuss and potentially vote on changing the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants when it meets Thursday at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. The panel spent hours during its last meeting in September discussing a proposal to delay the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine after several members raised issues about the available data. 
The standard vaccination schedule calls for a hepatitis B vaccine birth dose within 24 hours of delivery, regardless of whether a birth parent has been infected. All children complete the full vaccination series within 18 months. A chronic hepatitis B infection can lead to liver damage, liver failure, liver cancer or death. 
“The hepatitis B birth dose helps prevent a lifelong, potentially fatal, chronic infection, which can lead to serious liver disease and liver cancer later in life,” Director of Health Dr. Jerry Larkin said in a statement. “The hepatitis B vaccine has been tested extensively for safety, and we know that it works. Since 1991, when we started recommending it for all newborns, infections with hepatitis B virus in children and teens have decreased by 99%. No matter what is happening at the federal level, in Rhode Island, vaccine policy will continue to be grounded in science, data, and facts.”
Last week, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey’s administration also announced it would take all necessary steps to preserve continued access to the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns, regardless of any future action by the federal panel. 
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices can have up to 19 voting members who are independent medical and public health experts who are not employed by the CDC. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired all the panel’s members earlier this year, replacing them with 12 new advisers. The American Academy of Pediatricians and  other medical organizations filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Kennedy, saying the committee’s new appointees lack credentials and experience required of their role and asked for the group’s votes to be overturned.
Rhode Island’s health department joined a consensus statement on hepatitis B and newborns from the Northeast Public Health Collaborative, a coalition of public health agencies working together to share expertise, improve coordination, enhance capacity, strengthen regional readiness, and protect evidence-based public health.

A Superior Court judge ruled Saturday that he would not grant an injunction of the state’s return-to-office policy, paving the way for the state to enforce its Dec. 1 deadline for employees to begin in-person work. 
The Vermont State Employees’ Association had filed the lawsuit last month to challenge Gov. Phil Scott’s decision to order almost all state employees back to in-person work three days a week. 
In court last Wednesday, the union’s attorney argued that the policy would cause irreparable harm to certain employees forced to relocate or change their child care arrangements, among other impacts. That irreparable harm, Alfred Gordon O’Connell said, gives the court the right to intervene.

But in the ruling, Washington County Superior Court Judge Daniel Richardson sided with the state’s argument that employees have sufficient relief available through the state’s exemption process, in which employees can request temporary or long-term exemptions for their personal circumstances. 
Of the 3,000 employees newly expected to come into the office, 425 have requested exemptions, according to the state’s data cited in the decision. Only 25 exemptions have been granted, while the rest are pending. 
“On the present record, the Court would be speculating as to the scope, nature, and even severity of the harm if it went forward to grant relief in this case,” Richardson wrote.  
“This is not to say that there are not State employees who will be affected by this policy,” he continued. “Nor is it to minimize the hardships or concerns of those individuals, but it is to recognize that there are several processes in play, presently, that render a decision at this time from this Court inappropriate.”
The union has also filed complaints with the Vermont Labor Relations Board, which has scheduled an investigatory conference on Wednesday to determine whether the case should move forward, O’Connell said at the hearing.

It will now be the Commission on Fairness and Public Trust, the court announced in an order issued on Wednesday.
“The Commission became aware of two seemingly contradictory facts: that ‘DEI’ is now a polarizing concept in American life, while, at the same time, a commitment to fairness, acceptance of others, and equity is not,” Justice Elizabeth Welch, who served as one of the initial co-chairs of the Commission on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, explained in a concurring opinion to the order that called DEI a “political lightning rod.”
The purpose of the commission will now be to “ensure that all those served by the justice system are heard, valued, and respected,” while the previous version of the commission, which was initially formed in 2021, had a stated goal of the “elimination of disparities within the justice system.”

“The action of the Michigan Supreme Court is disappointing,” Lynna Kaucheck, the director of communications and coalitions at Michigan Voices, wrote in response to the change. “What remains to be seen is if this name change negatively impacts the original intent of commission, the consequences of that could devastate the progress that many of Michigan’s marginalized communities have made in recent years.”
The structure of the commission will remain largely unchanged in terms of membership and terms, but the duties of the commission will no longer focus on specifically demographic disparities, instead broadening to any disparities in the courts. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The change comes as diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, especially in government, have come under fire in national politics, with President Donald Trump on his first day in office referring to such policies as “radical” and “shameful discrimination.”
“Now more than ever we must remain committed to ensuring that no matter what you look [like], where you come from, or how much money you have in your wallet you should have equitable access to all the resources and opportunities that are necessary to thrive,” Kaucheck continued. “Removing references to DEI amounts to nothing more than kowtowing to the Administration’s continued attacks on marginalized communities.”
Justice Brian Zahra, the sole Republican on the court, expressed his concerns with the change in a dissenting opinion.
“What does it say about our commitment to transparency that this Court is willing to scrape the name off its DEI Commission at a time when DEI just so happens to be losing its popularity among the people?” he asked in the dissension. “Is it transparent to alter the name of this Commission but leave its members and its powers unchanged?”
Justice Brian Zahra
Zahra also noted his concerns with DEI more broadly, noting that the changes in the order were not making any meaningful changes to the commission’s purpose, only obscuring the fact that it was originally a DEI commission.
“This is a DEI Commission, no matter what name the Court now intends to give it or how vaguely the Court intends to phrase its goals,” he wrote. “The majority ought to have stood by their conviction that DEI was necessary and allowed Michiganders to judge, on the basis of clear facts, whether they approved of this Court’s exercise of its authority.”
Welch pushed back against some of Zahra’s concerns, especially his concerns about the transparency of this change, by citing how closely the goals align with the Justice for All Commission, another Supreme Court body that Zahra chairs, which seeks to increase access to the legal system.
“The FPT Commission was created precisely to ensure that we center service to the people of the state and remain steadfast in our commitment to transparency, best practices for retaining and attracting talent, and processes that ensure dignity and fairness for every person who walks through our courthouse doors,” she wrote.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8824-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 15:58:33.787770

Sheldon Timothy Herrington Jr., the University of Mississippi graduate accused of killing a fellow student and well-known member of Oxford’s LGBTQ+ community, pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree murder and tampering with evidence. 
The son of a prominent family in Grenada, Herrington was facing capital murder – and a potential sentence of life in prison – for killing Jimmie “Jay” Lee in the summer of 2022 and hiding his body. During a previous trial that ended in a hung jury, prosecutors alleged Herrington’s motive was to preserve the secret of his sexual relationship with Lee. 
The prosecution said it will now recommend a 40-year sentence with 10 years suspended. 
“He has accepted responsibility on his own instead of a jury placing responsibility on him,” said Lafayette County District Attorney Ben Creekmore. 
The plea deal came two and a half hours into jury selection in Madison County for the second trial. A judge ordered jury selection to take place outside Lafayette County, where trial was to be held, due to media coverage there.
It would have been the second time Herrington faced a jury. At the time of the first trial in December of 2024, law enforcement had not yet located Lee’s remains – a reason one juror reportedly refused to convict, causing a hung jury, according to Action News 5. This time, though, the state had Lee’s remains, which were found earlier this year in a wooded gully in Carroll County close to Herrington’s parents’ home. 
Herrington had been in jail since he was indicted for a second time earlier this year. 
Lee’s older sister, Tayla Carey, said she was “overfilled with happiness” at the plea, adding, “it’s well overdue.” 
Shortly after Lafayette County Circuit Court Judge Kelly Luther began winnowing the jury pool, a clerk approached the bench with papers. This prompted Luther to pause the selection and issue a warning to the nearly 150 potential jurors not to speculate or discuss the subject of the case before releasing them into the hallway.
An hour later, the prosecution and Herrington’s defense, Jackson-area attorney Aafram Sellers, reached a deal. Herrington’s mother tearfully met with the defense lawyers before she left the courthouse. 
Sellers did not want to comment on the plea until after sentencing, scheduled for Tuesday at 10 a.m. in Oxford. But he said the deal was possible once both sides “got to the courthouse steps.” 
Creekmore said the deal was unexpected. Though the defense had initiated some negotiations, he said they were “not robust.” Hotel rooms in Oxford had been booked for the jury; lunches and dinners ordered.
Though Lee’s family was already in Oxford, Creekmore said that Herrington was present for the deliberations in Madison. 
This resolution saves Lee’s family the agony of another trial and potential appeals, Creekmore said. It also adds back the charge of tampering with evidence, which Sellers had been successful in removing due to the statute of limitations. 
“It’s a terrible, sad, tragic story, and I’m relieved that the family does not have to relive the trauma of what happened to Jay Lee again,” Creekmore said. 
In Madison, some of the potential jurors said they knew what the case was about. One woman said it had been on the news this morning. But others were unaware, even after learning they had been called for a case from Lafayette County. 
Last night, some of Lee’s friends gathered outside the Lafayette County Courthouse with members of the local LGBTQ+ community.

The spike is an early estimate. Still, it’s likely to provoke fear for taxpayers, lawmakers and school administrators weary from years of rising costs.

Vermonters could see a nearly 12% property tax increase in 2026, according to early estimates from the state. 
The news arrived Monday in the form of the “Dec. 1 letter,” an annual Tax Department projection that represents the first public-facing estimate of the average expected education property tax rates. The estimate relies on data from the state Agency of Education and local school districts, which are already engaged in their budget-making processes, and is produced in collaboration with the Vermont Legislative Joint Fiscal Office. 
“The rate of increase that we’re talking about is simply unacceptable and certainly defines unaffordability,” Bill Shouldice, Vermont’s tax commissioner, said in a media briefing on Monday.

Education property taxes have risen more than 40% in the last five years, according to the Tax Department, even while student enrollment in Vermont has dropped. 
About half of the projected 11.9% average increase is due to anticipated increases in school district spending in the 2026-2027 school year, according to the Tax Department. The other half of the increase comes from not having the one-time allocation of roughly $100 million used last year to lower tax rates, a common practice in recent years adopted by the Legislature and governor. 
Property taxes rose on average by about 1% in 2025, though increases varied in towns and districts across the state. The modest increase resulted from lawmakers offsetting a 5.5% increase in school spending using one-time buy-down funds, a decision that makes this year’s increase appear higher.    
Rising property taxes — and the cost of public education — have been the driving force in Montpelier politics over the last two years. In the 2024 legislative session, property taxes were projected to rise by an average of more than 18%, leading voters to reject a historic proportion of school budgets. Reductions in spending and offsetting funds lowered the tax increase to less than 14%, but that spike fueled a wave of Republican House and Senate victories last November. 
Last legislative session, in response to rising education property taxes, lawmakers passed Act 73, setting in motion generational change to how education is paid for and governed in Vermont. But the bill depends on lawmakers approving new, consolidated school district maps this upcoming session. That requirement hit a speed bump last month, when the group tasked with proposing maps chose to endorse voluntary — rather than mandatory — district consolidation. 
Gov. Phil Scott labeled the task force’s recommendation a failure. Education Secretary Zoie Saunders added further criticism on Monday, arguing the state needs to act now to prevent an endless cycle of property tax increases and cuts to school budgets. 
“Rising property taxes have not prevented staffing cuts and school closures. Rising property taxes have not facilitated equitable opportunities for students in every community across Vermont, and rising property taxes have not moved the needle on improving educational quality,” Saunders said at the briefing. “Instead, we are contending with two enormous challenges: property taxes that families cannot afford and an education system that local communities cannot sustain.”
The 11.9% estimate was formulated using preliminary school budgets from about two-thirds of districts, according to the Tax Department. In years past, the Dec. 1 estimate has been higher than the ultimate average tax bill, as lawmakers have used new taxes and one-time money to bring down rates. School districts may also lower their budgets before votes on Town Meeting Day. 
Officials said Monday it was too soon to say whether Scott and his team would recommend budgeting money to buy down property tax rates this year. 
In the wake of the tax department’s Monday estimate, state political leaders chimed in to decry expected double-digit hike.
“The choice before lawmakers in 2026 is clear: show courage by working together to keep moving forward with our bipartisan transformation plan,” Scott said in a statement, “or explain to Vermonters why yet another double-digit tax increase is acceptable, and why we’ll continue to see them well into the future if we abandon our efforts.”
Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, said in a statement the pattern of property tax increases could not continue. 
“The truth is that Act 73’s success depends on even harder work being accomplished this session. I am committed to continuing this mission — in collaboration with the Governor, the House and my colleagues in the Senate,” he said. 
Baruth’s counterpart in the lower chamber, House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, echoed his call to action in a separate statement. 
“​​It’s important for all of us to remember that the challenges before us are decades in the making,” she said, “and we will continue to see double digit property tax projections and loss of educational opportunities for kids if we do nothing.”

(Photo by Jim Obradovich for Iowa Capital Dispatch)Whatever the unfortunate topic, people think, “Oh, that will never happen to me.” Maybe they believe it, or maybe they are just putting it out into the universe hoping the proclamation will protect them. Either way, I am here to tell you that it absolutely can happen to you — just like it did to me.
First off, let me say that this story is not typical of what I write here. However, it is about life in the Midwest, or anywhere for that matter. I also want to say that I struggled a lot with deciding to put it out here. Vulnerability is a hard thing. You leave yourself open to criticism, judgment, pity, bullying, and all kinds of things we don’t want to deal with. Telling the story is hard enough, who wants to deal with that kind of backlash on top of it? BUT — I decided this story is important, and now is the time to tell it. And please know: If you find yourself anywhere in this story, you are not alone.
So I am going to tell you how I found myself in need of food assistance. Did I EVER think that would happen to me? Certainly not. I was raised in a middle-class family that really never wanted for anything. We weren’t rich by any means, but we did OK. As life went on, I attended a good high school, went to business school, got a job, and found myself in a very short “practice” marriage. After having practiced long enough to figure out that was not the real deal, I later had another marriage that I imagined would be the last one. But, not so fast. After 12 years, I knew it was time to make a change. That I needed to make a change.
So with two small daughters, I found myself on my own. And I was more on my own than I ever imagined. Once the exceedingly long divorce ordeal finally ended, I found myself with nothing. Nothing. Somehow everything I had owned and all my money — every bit of it — had mysteriously been signed over to someone in my ex-husband’s family. “Devastated” does not even begin to explain how I felt. “Panicked” might be the word I want. What was I going to do?
Well, I had a pretty good job, but I knew I needed more, so I quickly found two others: Working part-time at the local Barnes and Noble bookstore and baking cookies for a coffee kiosk in the downtown skywalks. All the while trying to spend time with the girls. A trick for sure. But then it got even trickier, as my ex-husband managed to take over half of my income. With my house in foreclosure, and my hard-earned money going to someone else, I had to do something. I am telling you the truth when I say that some days, I did not have one dime to my name. Literally.
Through my bank, I was connected to an amazing person employed by the federal government who could help me with the house issue. She managed to get a low-interest second mortgage for me (that didn’t have to be paid back until I sold the house) that would take me out of foreclosure and allow me to get back to making regular house payments. That was a huge load off my mind — and checkbook — but I still had NO money.
Most of the time, I had to choose between driving somewhere and using precious gas, paying for a school activity, or buying food. Every single month I had to go down to the Waterworks office to pay my late bill in cash in order to keep the water on. Trying to be helpful, the woman who assisted me with the mortgage encouraged me to file for food stamps. But I just did not want to do that. What self-respecting member of society does that? Not me. That doesn’t happen to me.
Well, it did happen to me. Finally, armed with all my paperwork, including paystubs and tax documents that showed how much of my income did NOT come into my home, I gathered up all I had within myself and headed downtown to get food assistance. But — joke on me — at that time your eligibility was determined by your gross income. Not the net that you actually brought home. I’m not sure what the requirements are now, but according to the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services website, one must now meet both gross and net requirements.
So it turned out that, of course, between my three jobs, I made “too much money” to be considered for food stamps. I could not believe that no one considered how many dollars actually came through one’s door. The actual money available. Having been courageous enough to even try to get food assistance, the woman helping me saw how disappointed I was with the news I had received.
So she said, “Well, you can always get food from a food pantry.” And, truth here, I laughed out loud and replied, “No matter how much I don’t have, I always put something in the food pantry barrel at my grocery store.” And I left to go home to try to figure it all out. Again.

And somehow, I managed without ever visiting a food pantry. I’m not sure how, but I did. I just couldn’t make myself go even though I knew there was no shame in that. None. But I feel that people seem to think it’s an admission of failure, when really, it’s just accepting needed help. And we all need help now and again. In the end, what kept me from going was that I knew it would add one more notch to the I’m-going-to-take-her-down belt of my ex-husband.
But going down was not an option for me and I did make it. I kept the house until I was ready to sell it and — literally –move on. The girls graduated from high school and attended college, and I eventually had all my money coming home with me again. I had finally reached that seemingly elusive point where I could look back and say, “That was horrible.”
Fast-forward to today. Now. As I sit here remembering that time in my life, I am lucky enough to not have to worry about food. At least not right now. But who knows? So for many years I have made it a point to send an automatic monthly monetary donation to DMARC. As their website states “The DMARC Food Pantry Network consists of 14 individual partner pantries, multiple mobile food pantry sites, and a home delivery service. DMARC provides a guaranteed supply of food to our partner pantries, free of charge, and operates a centralized intake database.” I also deliver a box of food I’ve purchased to the West Des Moines Human Services folks every couple of weeks.
Food insecurity is a crisis in our country, and even more so right now. But for any one individual it might be a crisis on any given day. I know. I’ve been there. So of course I’m donating right now, but I’ve made those two donations mentioned above for many years and will continue to do so for as long as I am able. Because you never know when, through no fault of your own, it might happen to you.

Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, holds up his proposed mid-census redistricting ban outside the Senate chamber on Monday, Dec. 1, 2025. He walked inside to file the bill. Qaddoura told reporters he would also request a meeting with the Senate's GOP leader and ask him to hear the bill. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)An Indiana Democrat on Monday filed a bill to ban early redistricting as Republicans heed President Donald Trump’s call for a 9-0 sweep of the state’s congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, knows his bill is a long shot, but said it “protects voters, safeguards democracy and ensures that political power is earned, not manipulated.”
He spoke during a news conference at the Indiana Statehouse, an hour after House Republicans unveiled their proposed map.
Redistricting is typically done every decade, with the release of new census data. Republican supermajorities drew the current maps in 2021, and they’re not due for a refresh until 2030.

Fady Qaddoura, and League of Women Voters Indiana President Linda Hanson speak at a news conference about Qaddoura’s proposed mid-census redistricting ban on Monday, Dec. 1, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
The new map pulls from the same 2020 census data. It splits the Democrat-held 1st District into two. The 7th District, a Democrat-controlled seat that largely follows Indianapolis’ borders, is splintered across four districts.
“This is a pure political hijacking of the voters’ will,” Qaddoura said.
His legislation would prohibit mid-census redistricting unless a court orders a redraw because of a constitutional violation — “not because one party is losing power, and not because a president wants to tip the scales, and not because insiders fear competition,” Qaddoura said. It would be effective upon passage.
He was joined by a coalition of voting rights groups known as ALL IN for Democracy.
“This bill is clearly necessary at a time when partisan politics is infiltrating everything we do in state government,” said Julia Vaughn, executive director of Common Cause Indiana.
After the news conference, Qaddoura walked to the Senate offices to file his legislation.

He told reporters he’d also ask for a meeting with Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray — and request a committee hearing for the proposal. Without a hearing, it will die early.
Qaddoura said the bill would have bipartisan support on the Senate floor, if it gets that far.
“Due to the political environment and the attacks against many Republicans, they preferred not to be publicly identified as sponsors or authors on this legislation, really, because of security issues,” he said.
Several GOP senators and Indiana Gov. Mike Braun have reported swatting, intimidation and and bomb threats. Their stances on redistricting run the gamut, from opposed to undecided to supportive.
“I honored their will … but I received their full support,” Qaddoura added. “If this legislation makes it to the Senate floor, they will be voting in favor of it.”
House Speaker Todd Huston previously said he’d support a federal ban.
“Ultimately, I hope Congress takes action to prohibit mid-decade redistricting to ensure every state is operating under the same rules,” he said in a statement last month. “But … the fight is already here. The choice is whether we choose to unilaterally disengage or use every legal tool at our disposal to win and ensure Republicans have a fair chance in upcoming federal elections.”

	“John Crowther brings a deep understanding of Alaska’s natural resources and a proven commitment to responsible stewardship. His balanced approach to development and conservation makes him an exceptional choice to lead the Department of Natural Resources and serve the long-term interests of Alaskans,” Dunleavy said in a statement.
Crowther is a department veteran, having joined DNR in 2012. Prior to being named acting commissioner, he served as deputy commissioner managing the department’s oil and gas project permitting and geological survey divisions.
After his first years working for DNR, Crowther served from late 2017 to January 2019 as Alaska’s director of state and federal relations under then-Gov. Bill Walker, according to his professional biography. From January 2019 to January 2021, he served as a U.S. Senate Natural Resources Committee aide to Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. After that, he returned to DNR, the governor’s statement said.
“The Department’s constitutional mission to develop, conserve and maximize the use of Alaska’s natural resources is critical to our state,” Crowther said in the governor’s statement. “I will continue working as hard as I can to advance this mission and improve Alaska’s future through stewardship and responsible use of our resources.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)With one day to go until the Middle Tennessee U.S. Congressional special election, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson headlined a rally in Franklin for Republican Matt Van Epps, while Democrat Aftyn Behn campaigned in Clarksville.
The two candidates are locked into a tight race, vying to replace former Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Green, who resigned from the seat in July. 
Johnson and other speakers — including President Donald Trump, who Johnson called mid-rally — not only promoted Van Epps but also heavily criticized Behn. 
“You’ve got a radical on the ballot, we can’t hardly believe it,” said Johnson. “I thought Tennessee was deep red — how did it happen?”
“This is not a game: this is a dangerous far leftist, and (Behn) will be a rubber stamp for (U.S. House Minority Leader) Hakeem Jeffries and (U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez) and all the radicals in Congress,” he said.

Trump called Van Epps “fantastic.”
“He’s for everything that we represent,” said Trump, before saying Behn is getting “a lot of publicity cause she’s got a little something weird and television is doing whatever it can.”
While campaigning in Clarksville, Behn countered the Republican attacks by saying the Republican Party has no plans for lowering cost of living.
District 7 is a Republican stronghold which Trump won by 22% in the 2024 presidential election. The GOP has held the seat since 1982, through several redistricting cycles. 
But the race has become a priority for both parties since Democrats swept the Nov. 4 elections in other states, including New Jersey and Virginia — both of which elected Democratic governors — and in New York City, where Zohran Mandami won the mayoral election. 
Democrats across the nation drew hope from the November results and gave Republicans, who hold a three-seat majority in the U.S. House, anxiety about winning in Tennessee. A recent Emerson College/The Hill poll showed the race has narrowed to a 2% margin between the two candidates heading into Election Day.
Behn was elected to the legislature in a 2023 special election to replace the late Rep. Bill Beck. She beat three other candidates — including fellow state Reps. Vincent Dixie and Bo Mitchell  — to win the Democratic nomination. During her House tenure, she has twice proposed bills that would eliminate Tennessee’s grocery tax. 
GOP rally draws every prominent state Republican
Other speakers at the Van Epps rally included U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, U.S. Reps. Tim Burchett, Andy Ogles and John Rose, as well as several candidates who lost to Van Epps in the Oct. 2 Republican primary. 
One of those, Rep. Jody Barrett, the Dickson Republican who finished second in the primary, said it was the first Van Epps event he attended. 
About 300 people attended the event, held at the home of Willis Johnson, a billionaire and Republican donor, who is also the grandfather of state Rep. Jake McCalmon, a Franklin Republican. 
In making what is one of his final pitches to GOP voters, Van Epps said he plans to win decisively.

“We have the right solutions, the right plan to address affordability to drive down costs, to work on health care, childcare, housing and energy,” he said. “That’s what the president stands for, that’s what the speaker (Johnson) stands for.”
“The alternative is unacceptable,” said Van Epps. 
Mike Sholar of Franklin, who said he attended the rally because Van Epps shares similar values, referenced Mandami in speaking to the Lookout. 
“I am scared to death that what happened in New York will happen in my backyard,” he said.

Donations lean towards Behn, dark money spending split
Since the primary, Behn has out-fundraised Van Epps, posting just over $1 million in donations raised between the Oct. 15 pre-primary financial disclosure with the Federal Election Commission and the Nov. 12 filing. For the same period, Van Epps reported raising $590,000. 
Money from independent groups has poured into both sides, with about $7 million being spent as of Nov. 25. 
Johnson is only one of the national politicians who have weighed into the race: Trump endorsed Van Epps in the primary and has held two tele-rallies for him, with another scheduled for Monday night. 
Former Vice-President Kamala Harris urged Democrats to vote during a visit to Nashville in November, and former Vice-President Al Gore, a Tennessean, will join U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York and Pramila Jayapal of Washington in a Monday tele-rally. 
Hagerty told the Lookout that despite the district’s regular Republican voting record, he takes nothing for granted.
“This is a special election, typically low turnout. That means they’re vulnerable to being gamed and we could get a result that doesn’t reflect the district.”

This story was originally reported by Ebony JJ Curry of The 19th.  Meet Ebony and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Seventy years have passed since Rosa Parks refused to surrender her seat on a Montgomery bus, and yet the country still tries to shrink her into that single moment — a tired seamstress who’d simply had enough.
Detroit, the city where she chose to continue her life, insists on remembering her differently. Not as an icon frozen in time, but as a Black woman whose lifelong organizing stretched from sexual violence cases in rural Alabama to open housing fights on Detroit’s west side.
That fuller story  — truth beyond the myth — is exactly what the Rosa Parks Scholarship Foundation has fought to tell for 45 years.
The Rosa Parks Scholarship Foundation (RPSF) has awarded more than $3 million in scholarships to more than 2,250 high school seniors since its founding by The Detroit News and the Detroit Public Schools (DPS) in 1980.
“Most people actually don’t know the story of Rosa Parks,” said Dr. Danielle McGuire, RPSF board member, historian and author of “At the Dark End of the Street”, whose research permanently shifted how historians write about Parks and the civil rights movement. “She’s so much more interesting, so much more radical, and so much more involved in all kinds of things that we forget about. We keep her stuck on the bus in Montgomery in 1955.”
According to Kim Trent, a  Detroit civic leader and former board president, the foundation, created through a racial discrimination lawsuit settlement involving Stroh’s Brewing Company, became one of the rare instances where federal accountability for racism produced long-term investment in Black futures.












Most people actually don't know the story of Rosa Parks.


– Dr. Danielle McGuire




A judge, DPS and The Detroit News agreed the money should honor Parks — who was living in Detroit and working for Rep. John Conyers at the time — by funding scholarships for Michigan students devoted to service and social change.
It is a statewide program, reaching students from Detroit to Grand Rapids to rural school districts where scholarship dollars often determine whether higher education is possible at all.
That framing makes her legacy active, not ceremonial.
“As part of her family, I feel grateful to be able to work together with my fellow board members to keep fighting for more opportunities to continue to provide scholarships,” said Erica Thedford, Parks’ great-niece and a foundation trustee. “I think Auntie Rosa would be extremely proud of what the Foundation has been able to achieve.”
The numbers tell one story — more than 1,000 scholars, millions awarded, forty $2,500 scholarships each year — and the essays tell another. Applicants must identify a modern social issue and explain how they would confront it using principles Parks embodied: discipline, non-negotiable dignity, community before self.
“Reading the essays of the students who apply is a great reminder that each person doing one act, no matter how small, creates a stronger network of love and kindness,” Thedford said. “Some of these students come from extreme hardship and still find the time and resources to volunteer at food banks, shelters… Some even take it upon themselves to be the organizer of ways to help the less fortunate at their schools.”
The award is one-time, not renewable, yet its impact stretches across decades.
“Once you become a Rosa Parks Scholarship Foundation recipient, you are a Rosa Parks Scholar for life,” Thedford said. “These students are now part of a network of people who root for each other, and that kind of support system is important.”
Trent knows that firsthand: She was a Parks Scholar herself when she graduated from Cass Tech High School.
“I received the scholarship in 1987,” she said. “Ironically, not only did I get it, but my best friend… also received the same scholarship. And then her son got the scholarship like 30 years later.”
Trent said the scholarship’s origin mirrors Parks’ life — created in response to injustice and sustained through community action.
“It’s one of those rare occasions where something beautiful grew out of an instance of racism and oppression,” Trent said.
Over the years, some Parks Scholars attended community college. Others enrolled at flagship universities. All had to articulate how their education would serve a community beyond themselves.
Some, like Emmy-winning actor Courtney B. Vance, who’s from Highland Park, Michigan, went on to shape national culture. Others are now attorneys, educators and nonprofit leaders across the state.
“What gets lost in what she did is the reason she did it,” Trent added. “It wasn’t just so she could sit on a bus. It was because she was trying to open up opportunity for people who had been denied opportunity.”
That is the heartbeat of the foundation’s lineage.
Parks was not simply resisting segregation. She was rejecting the entire machinery that kept Black women from safety, education and economic autonomy.
McGuire’s research highlights how Rosa Parks was investigating sexual violence cases long before #MeToo, defending Black girls like Recy Taylor, whose voices were dismissed in courtrooms and newspapers. She worked alongside the NAACP on equity cases. When she left Alabama under threat of death and moved to Detroit, she became the neighbor who knew everyone’s children, the church member who attended every meeting, the woman who collected information and names and needs.
“She was the person in the neighborhood who knew all the kids, who worked in almost every community organization you can imagine, to make life better for her people,” McGuire said. “The scholarship foundation is an example of that — just one of many.”
Every year, nearly 400 applicants encounter that fuller history — the Parks who fought for open housing in Detroit, who believed in Black self-determination, who, as McGuire notes, “never stopped fighting for equality and justice for people who didn’t have a voice that was being heard.”
That is not accidental. It is by design.
“We ask our applicants to become familiar with Rosa Parks and the tactics and strategies she used to make changes in her community and how they will do the same,” McGuire said. “I think it gives them hope. It links them to a tradition and a history of hope and change.”
This anniversary of Parks’ arrest arrives as school boards strip Black history from K-12 classrooms and as scholarship programs for marginalized students come under attack. Thedford sees the foundation’s work as a refusal.












No matter how hard people try to cancel the past, the past is very much alive.


– Dr. Danielle McGuire




“During this time, when we are hearing of funding being pulled from schools and programs that are needed to serve our youth, the Foundation is able to continue its provision of funds,” she said.
McGuire is blunt about what that represents:
“No matter how hard people try to cancel the past, the past is very much alive,” she said. “Rosa Parks’ history gives us so much honesty about America… and studying her is paramount to getting through any difficult time.”
Seventy years later, the lesson remains unchanged: Rosa Parks did not fight for a place to sit, she fought for the generations who would rise. Today, those students are still applying, still studying her strategies, still refusing to yield.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rosa-Parks-statue-Nov-14-2025-700x467-1.jpg,,,2025-12-01 14:57:13.655869

(Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Minneapolis-based attorney Chris Madel, whose high-profile defense of a state trooper charged with murder raised his profile last year, launched a campaign for Minnesota governor Monday. He joins a growing field of candidates who will battle for the Republican nomination.
Madel represented State Patrol Officer Ryan Londregan, who was charged with murder and manslaughter after he shot and killed Ricky Cobb II in 2023. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty wound up dropping the charges against Londregan.
Madel is also an attorney for the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association and the conservative news site Alpha News.
“Minnesota has been bled dry by special interests and fraudsters under Tim Walz’s failed leadership,” Madel said in a statement. “This needs to end and it will end with me as governor of Minnesota.”
Madel grew up in Waseca and was a trial attorney in the U.S. Department of Justice’s antitrust division. He has a long history of defending law enforcement and white collar criminals, and he helped the late Minnesota Twins Hall of Famer Kirby Puckett win an acquittal against felony criminal charges in 2003.
Alliance for a Better Minnesota, a well-financed group aligned with Democrats, released a statement, saying Madel would be a “rubber stamp on President Trump’s harmful agenda.” Perhaps seeking to help his Republican opponents, ABM pointed out that Madel has contributed to Walz’s previous campaigns.
Other Republicans running include Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth; Republican Rep. Kristin Robbins; 2022 GOP nominee for governor Scott Jensen; and Kendall Qualls, an army veteran and health care executive.
If Republicans can raise money and blanket the media, they’ll have plenty to work with to attack Walz’s nearly eight years in office, especially the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars from government programs.
In the past week, Walz and the state garnered national attention for the fraud that has infiltrated at least two of Minnesota’s Medicaid programs, in addition to the pandemic food aid program fraud known as the Feeding Our Future scandal. Trump has been attacking Walz and Minnesota’s Somali community for days.
The New York Times over the weekend published a front-page article detailing the fraud that has occurred in recent years.
Walz — who is seeking a third, four-year term — went on “Meet the Press” Sunday, where he was asked about Trump’s comments and his stewardship of Minnesota.
“I take responsibility for putting people in jail. Governors don’t get to just talk theoretically, we have to solve problems. And I will note, it’s not just Somalis. Minnesota is a generous state, Minnesota is a prosperous state, a well-run state. We’re AAA bond rated. But that attracts criminals. Those people are going to jail. We’re doing everything we can. But to demonize an entire community on the actions of a few? It’s lazy,” Walz said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/P1163918-scaled-e1764617500172-1024x635.jpg,,,2025-12-01 14:57:13.655869

(Getty Images)The Florida Bar last week opened a disciplinary file on a Miami Beach City Commission candidate accused of defaming a local filmmaker who reported on her lasting affinity for her father, the serial killer inspiration for “Dexter” executed in 2012.
Monique Pardo Pope, one of two candidates in the Dec. 9 run-off election for the seat, has until the day after the election to respond to allegations that she defamed South Florida filmmaker Billy Corben when she claimed that he’d lost a defamation case.
This came after Corben discovered that her father was Manuel Pardo, an ex-cop turned drug dealer who murdered nine people in the 1980s and was executed for his crimes in 2012. Pardo Pope has since called her father her “hero,” signing off one Instagram post with his last words on the Florida State Prison’s execution table.
Opening a disciplinary file is the second step in a lengthy process to determine whether a Florida attorney has violated the Bar’s rules, although just 25% of yearly complaints against lawyers reach this step. This step simply means that if a complaint’s accusations are proven true, Bar rules would have been violated.
It is not an outright sign of guilt or non-compliance.
“The enclosed letter is an official inquiry by bar counsel,” reads the notice of grievance procedures emailed to Pardo Pope on Nov. 25, five days after Corben filed his Bar complaint.  “If you do not respond, the matter will be forwarded to the grievance committee for disposition … . Failure to respond may also be a matter of contempt.”
The letter asks the candidate to respond to Corben’s allegations by Dec. 10 via mail or email.
What happened?
The case emerged after the Miami New Times picked up Corben’s Sep. 25 report on Instagram that Pardo Pope’s father was a pro-Nazi, anti-Black serial killer executed by the state for the deaths of South Florida drug dealers and bystanders alike. Pardo Pope was four years old when the crimes occurred.
When the Times asked her to respond to Corben’s claims, she accused the filmmaker — known for documentaries like “Cocaine Cowboys” — of making a career off of “slinging mud, which has even resulted in losing a defamation case.”
Corben, who had not lost the defamation case against his movie-making company, in turn filed a Nov. 20 Bar complaint against Pardo Pope for allegedly defaming him.
He told the Phoenix at the time that his complaint was “not about the sins of the father, but about the lies of the daughter.”
When searching the Pardos family’s Hialeah apartment at the time, Corben said, officers found a family dog named “Satan,” tattooed with a swastika, Polaroid photos of Pardo’s victims, and a slew of anti-Black and anti-Jewish memorabilia.
After his death, Pardo Pope lauded her father as a “guiding light” on social media, vowing to bring the “kind of leadership” she learned from her family to City Hall.
“Happiest of Birthdays to this little girl’s first true love — her Daddy. You would’ve been 59 years young today. Missing you each and everyday, mi papi bello….my guiding light in the sky, my eternal best friend,” she wrote in 2015, including a photo of him holding her as a baby.
She signed it off with his final words on the execution table, “Airborne forever, love your Michi girl.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-01 19:22:35+00:00,CT Mirror,New Haven plant now the East Coast’s largest producer of biofuels,P.R. Lockhart and John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/01/american-greenfuels-biodiesel-energy-manufacturing-ct/,American GreenFuels' growth has been spurred by laws requiring fuel dealers to blend home heating oil with biodiesel to reduce emissions.,"Inside a green metal-clad building in the Port of New Haven, a kind of modern day alchemy is at work, turning used cooking oil into fuel capable of powering trucks and heating homes.
Within a maze of tightly stacked tanks, pipes and collection units, workers take the grease — or other available waste products such as animal fats, tallow and vegetable oils — and add an alcohol catalyst to trigger a chemical reaction that produces biodiesel, which is marketed as a more climate friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuels.
A series of rapid expansions in recent years has made the plant, home of American GreenFuels, the largest producer of biodiesel on the East Coast.
Originally opened in 2011 as Greenleaf Biofuels, the plant was later purchased by the American division of Swiss commodities trader Kolmar Group and renamed American GreenFuels. Since 2016, its output has quadrupled, from 15 million gallons to nearly 60 million gallons a year.
The most recent expansion, completed this summer, added a second story to the production floor.
“It often smells like french fries, as you might expect,” said Paul Teta, the vice president and general counsel for Kolmar Americas, which is based in Shelton.
The company’s growth has been spurred, in part, by government subsidies and laws requiring fuel dealers to blend home heating oil with biodiesel in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. Teta declined to say how much the company has invested in its New Haven plant, other than to say it was in the “many millions of dollars.”
According to Kolmar, the biodiesel made at its New Haven facility produces 86% less greenhouse gas emissions, on average, compared with ultralow-sulfur heating oil. The emissions reductions are even more substantial when the fuel is sold and burned in Connecticut, removing the need to transport it long distances on trucks.
New York City passed the nation’s first blended biofuel mandate in 2012 and was followed by a state laws in New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island.
Connecticut’s law, Public Act 181 of 2021, required that heating oils contain at least a 5% blend of biodiesel starting in 2022. That amount increased to 10% this year and is set to grow steadily until reaching a minimum 50% blend in 2035. (Roughly 400 million gallons of fuel oil is delivered each year in Connecticut, according to the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association.)
In addition to state incentives, biodiesel fuels were previously eligible for a $1 per gallon federal tax credit. As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, those credits were replaced by other tax incentives based on lowering carbon emissions. Despite what he called an “ambiguity” around the changes to federal policy, Teta said that increasing blended fuel ratios in the Northeast has provided stability to the industry.
“When the law got passed, that gave us enough certainty to be able to make the next level of investment,” Teta said.
“The federal program’s certainly still important, because it incentivizes the price, otherwise biodiesel would be more expensive,” he added. “We want to keep the price low. So all put together, it has been a good mix for us to be able to expand.”
A controversial energy source
Not everyone is happy about the push to adopt biofuels. Environmental advocates, including the Sierra Club, have argued that biodiesel perpetuates a reliance on fossil fuels and that states should instead seek to transition as rapidly as possible to all-electric options such as heat pumps.
“Electrification is really the answer for reducing emissions from vehicles and from home heating,” said Samantha Dynowski, the president of the Connecticut chapter of the Sierra Club. “We just want to make sure that our emphasis is on the long term solution, not kind of a bridge, because the more we invest in this, the less you can get off of it.”
Supporters of biofuels, however, say they offer a path for states like to Connecticut to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next several decades. Earlier this year, Gov. Ned Lamont signed a law setting a statewide net-zero emissions target by 2050.

Chris Herb, the president of the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association, said the state’s reliance on natural gas to meet its energy needs, along with the high cost of building out greener technologies such as solar and wind, make the expansion of biofuels essential to meeting to those targets.
“There’s no way to blend [natural gas] down like we can petroleum,” Herb said. “Our industry is the only way we, the state of Connecticut, are going to be able to continue to make gains in carbon dioxide reductions in the fastest, least expensive way.”
But even biodiesel production has faced concerns around environmental pollution. In September, the EPA announced that American GreenFuels will pay $143,000 to settle penalties in the wake of Clean Air Act violations that occurred at the plant between 2020 and 2022. In a press release, the federal agency explained that it “found that the facility failed to control the release of certain air pollutants” during maintenance and system repairs. 
When asked to respond to questions about the violations and the settlement, Kolmar Americas did not offer a detailed response. 
“American GreenFuels, LLC is in compliance with the Clean Air Act,” Teta said in an email.
When it comes to the carbon-reducing benefits of biofuels, it also depends on the kind of feedstock that goes into the production process.
Oils that are processed directly from crops such as soybeans and corn require land clearing and mechanical harvesting that itself produces more emissions than recycled feedstocks such as used cooking oil. Only 36% of the biofuels produced nationally in 2022 came from waste or recycled feedstocks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Teta declined to say what percentage of American GreenFuels’ products is recycled, but he said historically the company has sourced most of its feedstock from waste products.
That could change next year, he said, due to the elimination of tax penalties for biofuels derived directly from crops. The change, which was implemented as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald Trump in July, is likely to result in American GreenFuels using more bean oils in its production.
“We are mindful that we must remain competitive and diffuse the market’s concern that we will be priced out of the market for waste feedstocks and therefore become uncompetitive,” Teta said in an email. 
Currently, Teta said the company sources cooking oil from more than 5,000 locations, including restaurants in New York City where it’s shipped to New Haven on trucks or barges. Middlemen who pick up the oil from the restaurants or food manufacturing facilities are supposed to filter it to remove bits of food and other impurities. Still, workers sometimes have to remove those impurities once the feedstock arrives or rejigger their process based on the types of oil used in frying machines.
“Using all these waste streams, all these different types of oil, it makes it harder on ourselves,” said Sean Hayden, the quality lab manager at American GreenFuels. “Luckily, our formulation is flexible.”
A growing business
The biodiesel industry has expanded considerably in recent years, a shift that has helped expand biodiesel applications beyond transportation to include uses like electric power and heating oil, one of the main uses of biodiesel in Connecticut. Those changes have had broader economic effects: Recent research found the biodiesel industry generated nearly $42.5 billion in economic impact nationally in 2024, along with 107,400 jobs and $5.8 billion in wages.  
While American GreenFuels is one of a handful of East Coast operations, much of the growth in biofuels — a broader category that includes ethanol, biodiesel, and renewable hydrocarbon fuels— has been concentrated in the Midwest. The majority of corn-based ethanol and biodiesel production takes place in states like Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, where crops used for these fuels are grown. That expansion has led to concerns that some crops, like corn, are being diverted to biofuel production rather than the food supply.

The exact impact of corn-based biofuel production on food supplies and prices has been a point of contention between environmental groups and biofuel supporters. Biodiesel industry experts say other production methods, like the use of soybeans and specific operations like American GreenFuels’ use of previously used oils and fats, sidestep those tensions.
“There’s no food-for-fuel issue,” said Stephen Dodge, the director of state regulatory affairs for Clean Fuels Alliance America, the trade organization that represents American GreenFuels and other member organizations. “It’s not like ethanol.” 
In its latest biodiesel plant production capacity report, the U.S. Energy Information Administration found there were 48 biodiesel production plants operating in the U.S. as of January 2025. Collectively, those plants are capable of producing nearly 2 billion gallons of biodiesel in a year.  
And the industry is expected to grow further. Estimates currently suggest that biodiesel use could top 6 billion gallons by 2030 and reach 15 billion gallons by 2050. 
But production has faced headwinds in 2025, with biodiesel output falling earlier this year due to uncertainty around the future of federal tax credits and lower-than-expected profit margins.
Even so, American GreenFuels’ growth has made it a notable example of the manufacturing industry’s efforts to bounce back in Connecticut. The biodiesel industry supports some 1,250 jobs in the region, according to Clean Fuels Alliance America, and brought in some $47 million in revenue, according to Dodge. 
Supporters of biofuels argue that the energy source can help serve as a transitional step as the country moves towards electrification. 
“It’s really paramount upon private industry and government to do everything they can to start reducing carbon emissions as quickly as they can,” said Dodge. “We think that biomass-based diesel is the way to go.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GreenFuels-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-01 14:57:13.655869

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship announced Monday that applications were open to farmers, small businesses and nonprofits for cost-share grants to improve processing, equipment, facilities, training, food safety, continuing education and more. 
Iowa producers of locally made and raised products are eligible for up to $25,000 in matching funds, per project, from the state as part of the Choose Iowa program.
Choose Iowa is a network of more than 300 farmers, businesses and nonprofit organizations selling Iowa-made goods. The program is sponsored and marketed by the state. 
In April, IDALS awarded 33 value-added grants to producers. The grant requires a one-to-one match from recipients, which brought the 2025 investment total to $1.3 million for value-added improvements. Awarded projects included storage improvements, well and irrigation systems, automated bagging equipment, refrigeration and on farm-sale systems, according to the April release from IDALS. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said Monday in a news release Choose Iowa funding is helping farmers and small businesses “capture” the momentum building for local Iowa products. 
“These value-added grants make it possible for innovative projects to move from dream to reality, whether that’s expanding processing capacity, upgrading equipment, or creating new customer ready products,” Naig said. “I encourage farmers, small-businesses, and entrepreneurs to learn more and apply. Every successful Choose Iowa project strengthens our rural communities and gives consumers more access to the fresh and local products they are looking for.”
The Legislature allocated $500,000 for the value-added grants in 2025-2026 fiscal year. The Legislature also stipulated another $500,000 of the Choose Iowa total budget would go to the program’s dairy innovation grants, which similarly help local dairies with infrastructure and training improvement
Since 2022 IDALS has funded 100 projects with the Choose Iowa value-added grant program, with a total state investment of $1.6 million. 
Applications for the grant, and additional instructions are available online, where they must be submitted before noon on Jan. 16, 2026. IDALS said recipients of the grants will be announced in the spring.

(Phto by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)President Donald Trump’s unprecedented plan to redraw state congressional maps to preserve the GOP’s narrow majority in the House ahead of the 2026 election has hit some bumps, but Republicans appear confident they can flip several Democratic seats in Florida, where the first steps in that process will begin this week.
A select House committee on congressional redistricting will convene Thursday afternoon in Tallahassee. It’s the first legislative meeting on the issue since Gov. Ron DeSantis said in July that it would be “appropriate to do a redistricting” in the middle of the decade. He followed up on that in August, saying that he and Attorney General James Uthmeier supported an update to the 2020 Decennial Census.
DeSantis said Florida had been “shortchanged in the reapportionment stemming from the last census” in 2020, although no new update to that census has taken place.
Florida House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell slammed the proposal Monday, saying the only reason it is happening is because Trump wants to “rig” next year’s midterm elections because “he wants to stop Americans from holding his administration accountable for their bad decisions.”
‘Swamp-like cynical behavior’
“Any attempt to draw new maps in Florida right now is a direct response to the president’s pressure to stack the deck before the midterms, and that is illegal in Florida,” Driskell said on a Zoom press conference for Florida reporters.
“The Fair Districts amendments to the Florida Constitution outlaw drawing maps to benefit one party over another. Redistricting decides who represents us in our government. A process that must serve the people, not politicians. This isn’t something that the people asked for. This is just the swamp-like cynical behavior that people hate about politics.”
Florida’s Fair District amendments prohibit line-drawing that intentionally favors or disfavors a political party or incumbent.
With the Democrats in superminority status in both chambers of the Legislature, Driskell acknowledged her party can’t stop GOP members but said she is putting some hope in the Senate rejecting the move.
“We don’t have the numbers to stop this, but we haven’t seen what’s going to happen in the Senate yet and, interestingly, more and more we’re watching our state Senate become a backstop to guard against some of the more dangerous whims of the legislation that we see coming out from the House.”
Senate Republicans, who hold a 26-11 advantage over Democrats in that chamber, haven’t said much about the idea of congressional redistricting since the governor’s comments over the summer.
“I’d like to see some data on the magnitude of people in the state of Florida who might be here illegally who have been part of the calculation on re-districting,” Pinellas County Republican state Sen. Nick DiCeglie told the Phoenix last month.
“I think that we should have redistricting based on United States citizens, and we’ll see how that plays out here, if possible. It’s always good to focus on U.S. citizens and see exactly what needs to be done to accomplish that.”
Senate President Ben Albritton hasn’t made any comments about redistricting, and no committee that would oversee the issue has been formed yet in that chamber.
Driskell said she has taken solace from the fact that several Republicans in Indiana have spoken critically of congressional redistricting in their state. However, after pressure from the White House, Indiana House Republicans Monday proposed a redrawing that would let their party control all nine House seats (Democrats hold two of the state’s nine seats).
The first congressional redistricting took place in Texas earlier this year. That came after Trump said during the summer that Republicans were “entitled to five more seats” in the Lone Star State.
A federal court blocked Texas last month from using its new map, ruling that it is likely an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, and ordered the state to use its previous map in the 2026 election. The new map is now back in place, at least temporarily, after Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito granted the state’s request to pause that federal court’s ruling.
Tampa Bay-area Democratic U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor says Tallahassee Republicans should be focused on lowering Floridians’ property insurance and electricity bills, not redistricting. “I think it’s a waste of time and money,” she told the Phoenix last week.
Florida Republicans represent 20 of the state’s 28 congressional districts.
Ahead of the committee meeting Thursday, a group of voting and civil rights organizations calling themselves the “No Partisan Maps” coalition are scheduled to hold a protest in front of the Capitol. The Florida House Select Committee hearing on congressional redistricting will begin at 1:30 p.m.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_0003-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-01 14:57:13.655869

(Photo via James Clark, Facebook)A veteran from East Machias has entered the running for the open seat in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District.
James Clark filed to run for the now open seat in what is often considered one of the most hotly contested U.S. House seats in the country, according to paperwork filed with the Federal Elections Commission. He’s running as a Republican, which tees up a primary next June between Clark and former Maine governor Paul LePage.
Clark was a registered Democrat for years, but left because he believes he can “do the most good” with like-minded people in the Republican Party, according to his campaign website. 
Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, who has held the seat for eight years, said in early November that he would not seek reelection next year. In his announcement, Golden said he hoped his exit would clear the way for competitive primaries for both parties.
With Golden out of the running, there are currently three Democrats vying for the seat as well, including State Auditor Matt Dunlap, Louis Sigel, who formerly served as secretary for the Kennebec County Democratic Committee, and Jordan Wood, who switched from the race to unseat U.S. Sen. Susan Collins to the CD2 election after Golden’s announcement.
To qualify for the primaries, candidates for the U.S. House must gather between 1,000 and 1,250 signatures from registered voters by mid-March. Candidates can start circulating petitions after the new year.
Though the district has been held by a Democrat in recent years, 2nd District voters also backed President Donald Trump three times. 
In addition to fighting for free speech, excellence in education, secure borders, lower costs and smaller government, Clark described himself on his website as “pro-working class, pro-family, pro-opportunity, and very anti-authoritarian.”
With undiagnosed dyslexia and struggling grades, Clark said he dropped out during his sophomore year of high school and later enlisted in the military. 
He cites his difficulty in school as motivating his desire to see Maine and the nation receive top ranking for education. He would like to see more support for students to explore careers in the trades, as well as increased critical thinking, art and music education.

(Franklin County Property Valuation Administrator photo)The Kentucky Democratic Party has sold its longtime headquarters near Interstate 64 and plans to move to a new office in downtown Frankfort. 
The state party, which has seen its power dwindle in recent decades, will move to an office on Ann Street Friday, Dec. 5, in hopes of being more accessible to lawmakers, advocates and reporters working at the state Capitol.
The Kentucky Democratic Party (KDP) finalized the sale of the building on Tuesday to a business, Means Drive of Nicholasville, for $540,000, according to Franklin County property records.
Democrats bought the site on Democrat Drive near I-64 in 1973 for $25,000. The building was named in honor of former Democratic U.S. Sen. Wendell H. Ford, who represented the state in Washington until 1999. He was governor at the time the party bought the property.
The Republican Party of Kentucky, which celebrated the grand opening of an expansion of its party headquarters in November, called the Democrats’ move “another sign of their continual decline.” Around the turn of the 21st century, Democrats began losing ground in Kentucky, as Republican nominees regularly won the state’s electoral votes in presidential elections and the congressional delegation became a majority of Republicans. The GOP eventually took an overwhelming majority of seats in the state House and Senate. 
“Since Governor Beshear took office Kentucky Republicans have flipped voter registration, expanded our supermajorities and now hold nearly every federal and constitutional office,” said RPK spokesman Adam Hope in a statement. “The Beshear playbook is simple. Ride Republican success while ignoring the collapse happening inside your own party.”
However, KDP said the Republicans should have bigger concerns than where the Democrats’ headquarters is. 
“The Republican Party of Kentucky should be more concerned about Kentuckians losing jobs, food and health care as a result of the GOP-backed federal budget than they are about KDP headquarters,” said KDP Executive Director Morgan Eaves. “But we haven’t seen a GOP press release on those issues in a long time.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/kdphq-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 13:57:45.229773

The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown is causing heartache and consternation for thousands upon thousands of North Carolinians. What’s more it’s not just people lacking proper documentation who are being negatively impacted. As NC Newsline journalist Brandon Kingdollar recently reported, in many instances, it’s American citizens and lawful residents who are being wrongfully targeted and harmed, and recently, we caught up with Brandon to learn more. We also got a chance to ask him about another controversial federal law enforcement initiative – this one targeting a product that millions of Americans have grown used to being lawful.

Free.,Congress to probe U.S. strikes on boats in Caribbean,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-probe-us-strikes-boats-caribbean,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate and House Armed Services committees will open bipartisan inquiries into U.S. military strikes on suspected drug-running boats in the Caribbean Sea, with a focus on an alleged follow-on attack that The Washington Post reported killed two survivors of the initial operation.Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and ranking member Jack Reed, D-R.I., issued a joint statement Friday promising “vigorous oversight” of the killings.“The Committee is aware of recent news reports — and the Department of Defense’s initial response — regarding alleged follow-on strikes on suspected narcotics vessels in the SOUTHCOM (Southern Command) area of responsibility. The Committee has directed inquiries to the Department, and we will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances,” Wicker and Reed said.Similarly, House Armed Services Committee Chair Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and ranking member Adam Smith, D-Wash., said in a joint statement Saturday that the panel “is committed to providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defense’s military operations in the Caribbean.”“We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,” according to the statement.The inquiries mark a rare bipartisan check on President Donald Trump’s administration since his second term began in January. With the exception of voting to release the federal case files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which Trump eventually endorsed, Republicans have largely left Trump’s decisions and policies unchallenged.Follow-on attack reportedLawmakers’ attention was retrained on the already legally questionable U.S. operations targeting alleged narcotics boats after an investigative report published Friday by The Washington Post revealed Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth gave verbal orders to kill everyone during a Sept. 2 operation —  the first of several U.S. boat strikes in the Caribbean Sea that have killed roughly 80.According to the report, two survivors clung to burning wreckage after an initial hit. Adm. Frank M. “Mitch” Bradley, who was commanding the attack from Fort Bragg in North Carolina, ordered a second, or follow-on, strike to fulfill Hegseth’s order and kill the remaining survivors. States Newsroom has not independently confirmed the details.Hegseth called the report “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory,” in a post on social media Friday.Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told CBS News’ “Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan” on Sunday the follow-on strike could rise “to the level of a war crime if it’s true.”""If that reporting is true, it's a clear violation of the DoD's own laws of war, as well as international laws about the way you treat people who are in that circumstance,"" Kaine said.A working group of former military lawyers issued a statement Friday urging Congress to investigate the Sept. 2 strike.“Since orders to kill survivors of an attack at sea are ‘patently illegal,’ anyone who issues or follows such orders can and should be prosecuted for war crimes, murder, or both,” according to the statement published by Just Security, a journal focused on national security published by the New York University School of Law Reiss Center on Law and Security.A bipartisan effort, led by Kaine, to stop Trump’s deadly strikes in the Caribbean narrowly failed in the Senate in early November.Trump echoes Hegseth denialTrump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday he “wouldn’t have wanted that” when asked about the alleged follow-on strike that killed the two survivors.“The first strike was very lethal. It was fine, and if there were two people around — but Pete (Hegseth) said that didn't happen,” Trump told reporters. “Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,” Trump continued in a back-and-forth with the press.Trump also said Saturday he was closing the airspace above Venezuela, but told a reporter who asked Sunday if the move previewed a U.S. airstrike of the country not to “read anything into it.”“To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY,” he wrote on his own social media platform just before 8 a.m. Eastern Saturday.Trump confirmed reports he spoke to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro late last month but would not reveal details of the conversation.The U.S. has been amassing Navy vessels and troops off the coast of Venezuela for months, including the recent addition in mid-November of the Navy’s most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford.",,,,2025-12-01 13:57:45.229773

Everett Thomas Pierce passed away peacefully on November 28, 2025. Tom was born June 24,1947 to Yvette A. and Everett T. Pierce in Stamford, Connecticut where he was raised. After graduating from Saint Michael’s College in Vermont he returned to Connecticut to his first job in advertising in New York City during the MadMen days. Vermont had spoiled him so he returned to the Green Mountains to work with Fayston Company who owned and managed Glen Ellen ski area. In 1977 he partnered with Michael Kehoe to open a fine men’s clothing store on the corner of Church and College Street in the City of Burlington, where they had a partnership for 42 years. After Michael retired in 2020, Tom rebranded the business naming it MK Clothing, with partners Sadie and Hagen Peyser, who are long time friends.
Tom served on many boards over the years including the Associate Board of the University of Vermont Medical Center, Friends of the Vermont State House and UVM’s Fleming Museum of Art. He also served multiple positions in the Society of Colonial Wars in the State of Vermont through his 13th generation descent from his namesake Thomas Pierce of Charlestown, Massachusetts.
Tom served as the co-curator in 2001 of Vermont’s 19th century landscape artist Charles Louis Heyde, with an accompanying book, featuring the paintings that were highlighted  at the UVM Fleming Museum of Art.

Dick Harpootlian, seen during a South Carolina Senate Judiciary Committee meeting in Columbia, S.C. on Tuesday, March 15, 2022, is the author of a book about famous serial killer Pee Wee Gaskins. (Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — During a break in the 1983 trial that sent Donald “Pee Wee” Gaskins to death row, the serial killer called for prosecutor Dick Harpootlian.
“You know, you’re just like me,” Gaskins said.
“You like killing,” Gaskins added. When Harpootlian asked what he meant, Gaskins told him, “You like killing me.”
That interaction stuck with Harpootlian, a Columbia attorney and former state senator. He wanted for years to write a book about Gaskins’ life and the 13 people he confessed to killing during the 1970s but struggled with how to frame it. The moral question he faced over pursuing the death penalty became his angle, he said.
Gaskins “was pure evil, and he got in my head,” Harpootlian said. “The book is about how I got to where I got, how he got to where he got, and how you wrestle with that.”
Harpootlian’s book, “Dig Me A Grave,” comes out Dec. 16.
Harpootlian will launch the book that evening in a conversation with Dawn Staley, coach of the University of South Carolina’s women’s basketball team and a true crime fan, at Columbia’s 701 Whaley event space.
Soon after Gaskins was executed in 1991, a clerk asked Harpootlian if he wanted to keep any evidence from the case. Looking through photographs, records of Gaskins’ arrest and the 300-page written confession Gaskins gave in 1978, Harpootlian realized there was enough for a book, he said. He kept all of it.
“It was a treasure trove of files on Gaskins,” said Harpootlian, a Democrat later elected to Richland County Council and as 5th Circuit solicitor (chief prosecutor for Richland and Kershaw counties) before he became a defense attorney. In 2018, voters sent the former state Democratic Party chairman to the state Senate.
When the COVID-19 pandemic ended the legislative session early and suspended trials, Harpootlian decided to get serious about telling Gaskins’ story. An agent got him in touch with author and journalist Shaun Assael, whose most recent book explored the death of boxer Sonny Liston.
Together, Harpootlian and Assael combed through the old case files and interviewed police officers and other witnesses involved in Gaskins’ investigations and trials. Harpootlian wrote down what he could recall and checked his own memories against those of other people involved, he said.
“I think there’s less speculation in this book than any other true crime book I’ve ever read, because I was there,” Harpootlian said. “I prosecuted. I saw every document. We interviewed every witness. I was in the courtroom for six weeks.”
Harpootlian was even on a first-name basis with Gaskins, a first for the then-prosecutor. The killer could charm just about anyone, and on his first day in the courtroom, he greeted Harpootlian by name.
“From then on, it was Dick and Pee Wee,” Harpootlian said.
Preparing to prosecute Gaskins for the killing of fellow inmate Rudolph Tyner, Harpootlian learned all the brutal details of how Gaskins killed at least 13 people and raped several of them. Gaskins drowned, beat and shot his victims to death, including a 2-year-old and her pregnant mother.
Gaskins later claimed he killed dozens more, but investigators only definitively linked him to those 13 cases.
Although a jury recommended the death penalty during Gaskins’ first murder trial in 1976, after finding him guilty of one of the killings, the state Supreme Court later changed his sentence to life in prison, finding the state’s law about executions unconstitutional.
A year later, a second jury found Gaskins guilty of killing farmer Silas Yates, but because the state’s death penalty law was still considered unconstitutional, Gaskins received another life sentence. Facing a third murder trial, Gaskins pleaded guilty to the 13 killings investigators had linked to him in exchange for eight more life sentences.
By the time Harpootlian stepped in to prosecute the 1982 killing of Tyner, a U.S. Supreme Court decision reinstating the death penalty nationwide made it an option once again. Harpootlian just had to decide whether to try again for a death sentence or allow Gaskins to remain in prison for the rest of his life.
The decision weighed on Harpootlian. He personally opposed the death penalty, but as a prosecutor, he took an oath to uphold the law, he said.
He also had to weigh any decision he made in the context of his own political ambitions.
Harpootlian went to his father, a World War II bomber, for advice. When Harpootlian asked whether his father regretted his actions during the war, his dad responded that everything he did was in self-defense.
Considering Gaskins found a way to kill a man inside the state’s most secure prison facility, Harpootlian decided the same thinking applied in his decision. Executing Gaskins would prevent him from harming anyone else in a way prison walls couldn’t, he said.
“I think the death penalty is appropriate where it’s self-defense,” Harpootlian said. “And Gaskins is self-defense.”
That much was clear when Gaskins attempted to hire someone to kidnap Harpootlian’s then-4-year-old daughter ahead of his execution date, Harpootlian said. When the time came for Gaskins’ 1991 execution, Harpootlian decided not to attend, in part out of fear over leaving his family alone and in part because he didn’t want to watch a man die.
Death row inmate becomes 3rd in SC executed by firing squad

“Wanting to watch somebody die would be what Pee Wee would do,” Harpootlian said. “And I’m not him.”
Grisly descriptions of Gaskins’ death in the electric chair prompted Harpootlian to propose as a legislator giving death row inmates a firing squad option.
His proposal came during Senate floor debate on legislation reverting to electrocution as the state’s primary execution method, which was signed into law in May 2021. Since the state Supreme Court upheld that law last year, three inmates have chosen to die by firing squad.
Harpootlian again ended up in the national spotlight defending Alex Murdaugh, who was convicted in 2023 of killing his wife and son two years prior. Perhaps one day he’ll write a book about that saga, which captured the attention of millions of people, he said.
But Gaskins’ story felt too unique to ignore, he added.
“Gaskins is, thank god, one of a kind,” Harpootlian said. “He was the most evil man I’ve ever met, and when you spend time with and become on a first name basis with evil, it haunts you even after he’s dead.”

Iowa Board of Regents President Sherry Bates announced Monday in a news release she will resign from the governing board Dec. 4, the day after a meeting is scheduled to elect new leaders. President Pro Tem Greta Rouse also stated she will step down from the position but remain on the board as a member. Her term as regent expires in 2027.
Bates said in the release she’s been “fortunate enough to serve on the board for nearly 11 years,” during which she worked with “outstanding” regents and staff, both for the board and universities, to accomplish their duties.

“It’s time for me to step back, spend more time with my family, and allow the next generation of Regent leadership to continue our good work,” Bates said in the release. “Iowa, Iowa State and UNI are among the best public universities in the country, and I look forward to seeing them continue to grow and excel.”
She also thanked Gov. Kim Reynolds and former Gov. Terry Branstad, who appointed and reappointed her to the board during her service. Bates’ term was set to end April 30, 2029, the release stated.
Rouse, who first served on the board as a student regent from 2008-2012, was appointed by Reynolds to the board again in 2021. She stated in the release she wants to focus on her family and “still young” children, and being a leader on the board is an “additional time commitment.”
“Iowa’s universities inspire the next generation, drive our economy, advance research, and enrich communities across the state,” Rouse said in the release. “Stepping down from leadership will allow me to do that while continuing to support their important work.”
Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, released a statement on the announcement from Bates and Rouse, saying the changes in leadership “presents an opportunity to chart a new path for the Iowa Board of Regents.”
Collins has been outspoken about decisions made by the board of regents as well as state universities, including when university employees came under fire for discussing circumventing diversity, equity and inclusion changes on campus and posting on social media about right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk after his death and when President Donald Trump announced a new higher education compact.
“For years now, lawmakers have called for a change in direction for not only our universities, but also the Board of Regents,” Collins said in his statement. “I look forward to working with the next board president to continue to reform Iowa’s higher education system.”

Oct. 18, 2025. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)A key environmentally-focused political group in Maine is backing Hannah Pingree for governor. 
Maine Conservation Voters Action Fund announced its support for the Democrat at a news conference Monday in Portland. The political action committee picked Pingree for the June 9 primary from a crowded field of big name Democrats because of her work related to climate change and transitioning to clean energy. 
Though the organization works to elect “climate and environmental champions” to serve as state legislators and governor, this is the first time it has made an endorsement in a gubernatorial primary.
“Maine needs a governor who has the courage to stand up to President Trump, and the savvy to win when she does. We need a governor who can build lasting coalitions and bring people together, but who will never compromise on her values and will fight for Maine’s people and communities,” said Maureen Drouin, executive director of Maine Conservation Voters.
So far in the president’s second term, the Trump administration has enacted a sweeping agenda to roll back environmental regulations, including on coal-fired power plants, water pollution, vehicle emissions and more. The administration has also sought to downplay the impact of global warming, such as with an executive order to remove signs throughout the nation’s national parks that explained how climate change was contributing to changing landscapes and what steps visitors could take to reduce their carbon emissions.
In light of that federal posture, the group highlighted Pingree’s current and former work in Maine to protect natural resources and public health. The speakers at the news conference Monday specifically mentioned legislation she sponsored as a state representative in 2008 to reduce children’s exposure to concerning chemicals, as well as a 2007 bill she led to ban toxic chemical flame retardants.
Pingree’s more recent work as part of the administration of Gov. Janet Mills also helped win her the favor of Maine Conservation Voters. As co-chair of the Maine Climate Council, she helped develop the state’s climate action plan. Through that work, the state created a storm recovery fund and programs to protect working waterfronts and other critical infrastructure from climate catastrophes. 
Pingree, who said she was honored to earn this endorsement, said that she would continue to fight on behalf of Maine’s people and environment if elected governor. She noted that she’s spent most of her life living in the island town of North Haven, including the time she served in the Maine House “representing my neighbors who make a living on the ocean where a clean environment is tied to livelihoods and the future of our communities.”
From 2019 to earlier this year, Pingree served as director of Maine’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, where she worked to make the state more resilient against extreme weather and led initiatives to help people lower their energy costs and transition their homes from fossil fuels to heat pumps.

It’s called End Stigma CT and is backed by a $10 million federal grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Stigma can lead to social isolation and prevent people from seeking treatment for a substance use disorder, according to the 2024 Shatterproof Addiction Stigma Index (SASI).
Stigma can take many forms: ER staff showing a bias when assessing pain in patients with substance use disorders, or people with substance use disorders avoiding police in emergencies because they fear arrest.
And stigma is a reality playing out across the country, including New Haven County, said Maritza Bond, health commissioner for the city of New Haven.
“Last year we saw that one in five individuals, who needed treatment for a substance use disorder received it,” Bond said, citing national data. “We want to increase that number.”
The campaign’s theme “It Started With” seeks to educate the community about stigma’s impact on people seeking help and to build empathy around how drug use can start for many people.
The concept was created following research with people who shared their experiences with opioids after an injury, or to cope with emotional or mental trauma like losing a family member, a divorce, or post traumatic stress disorder.
“Research shows that stigma is one of the greatest obstacles people face when trying to seek help,” Austin Telfold, overdose prevention navigator, Naugatuck Valley Health District, said in a statement. “We want our community to understand that addiction is not a moral failure — it’s a health condition that deserves empathy, treatment, and hope.”
The grant money will be used to hire patient navigators to go into communities and talk about stigma.
In the Eastshore Health District, which includes Guilford, Madison, Branford, East Haven and North Branford, stigma could look like denying that substance use exists in wealthy communities, said Theresa Heier, a nurse with Eastshore.
But substance use is a problem in wealthier communities, too, she said.
“It’s happening mostly in the home,” she said. “It’s not exactly happening on the streets where they can see it.”
“Part of the stigma campaign, we go into the community and try to normalize that, yes, this is a chronic disorder, just like diabetes or heart disease or anything else,” Heier said.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)President Donald Trump suffered another loss Monday in his ongoing fight to make his former personal lawyer the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey, with a federal appellate panel upholding a lower court ruling that disqualified Alina Habba from the post.
U.S. Third Circuit Judge D. Michael Fisher, writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, said Habba’s continued service in a job she first took in March violates the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and undercuts constitutional protections meant to ensure the three branches of government remain separate but equal.
Fisher barred Habba from the job, affirming U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann’s August ruling, which Brann had put on hold pending appeal. This is a fight the Trump administration has been waging elsewhere in the country, including Virginia and Nevada, so Monday’s precedential ruling promises far-ranging impact.
Fisher noted that the Senate did not act to confirm Habba within the 120 days the Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act requires, triggering a provision in the 2007 law that authorizes federal judges to appoint an interim replacement if the clock runs out without Senate action.
When New Jersey’s federal judges appointed Desiree Leigh Grace in July instead of Habba, Trump administration officials fired her and resorted to a string of maneuvers to keep Habba in the job. Those maneuvers served to “sidestep” the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and statutory requirements reflecting Congress’s intent for someone with “a breadth of experience to properly lead the office,” Fisher wrote.
“It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place,” Fisher wrote. “Its efforts to elevate its preferred candidate for U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, Alina Habba, to the role of Acting U.S. Attorney demonstrate the difficulties it has faced — yet the citizens of New Jersey and the loyal employees in the U.S. Attorney’s Office deserve some clarity and stability.”
Fisher’s ruling, which came after both sides argued the case in October in Philadelphia, did not answer the question of who is the U.S. attorney in New Jersey, with Habba now disqualified. Spokespeople in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s office and the Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment.
Others celebrated the decision.
Abbe David Lowell, Gerald Krovatin, and Norm Eisen, three of the attorneys who had challenged Habba’s authority, vowed to continue challenging “President Trump’s unlawful appointments of purported U.S. Attorneys wherever appropriate.”
“The court’s decision affirms that U.S. Attorney Alina Habba is unlawfully and invalidly serving as the chief federal law enforcement officer in New Jersey, marking the first time an appeals court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions,” the attorneys wrote in a statement.
U.S. Sens. Cory Booker and Andy Kim, Democrats whose support the Trump administration would need to advance a U.S. attorney nominee for New Jersey, hailed Monday’s ruling as one that vindicates their concerns about the “extraordinary and unlawful steps taken by the Trump Administration to keep Habba in office without Senate confirmation.”
“The Court’s ruling underscores a simple but fundamental principle: U.S. Attorneys must be independent and installed consistent with the rule of law, not because of their political loyalty or through political maneuvering. The Trump Administration’s attempt to bypass clear legal requirements to install a loyalist undermined the legitimacy of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey and cast a shadow over the cases she oversaw,” they said in a joint statement.
The panel that issued Monday’s decision includes two Bush appointees — Fisher and Judge D. Brooks Smith, who are both senior judges. The third judge on the panel, L. Felipe Restrepo, is an Obama appointee.
Observers expect the case could end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-01 16:46:09+00:00,CT Mirror,¿Por qué detuvieron las renovaciones de las escuelas públicas de Hartford?,Mariana Navarrete Villegas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/01/hartford-pausa-renovaciones-escuelas-publicas/,Las renovaciones de seis escuelas formaron parte de un esfuerzo para que los residentes de Hartford regresaran a estudiar al distrito.,"Read this story in English.
Cuando el alcalde de Hartford, Arunan Arulampalam, anunció en septiembre la pausa de las renovaciones financiadas por el estado de seis escuelas públicas, la decisión sorprendió a la Junta de Educación y al Comité de Construcción Escolar de Hartford.
La Junta y el Comité habían votado a favor junto con el Ayuntamiento, para que las renovaciones se llevaran a cabo en las escuelas primarias Moylan, Parkville Community, McDonough Middle, S.A.N.D, Maria C. Colon Sanchez Elementary y Batchelder.
Ya estaba aprobada la financiación estatal.
Las renovaciones escolares formaron parte de un esfuerzo para que los residentes de Hartford regresaran a estudiar al distrito. En los últimos cuatro años, aproximadamente 5.000 estudiantes se mudaron fuera de la ciudad. Muchos de los cuales se reubicaron en lugares como New Britain, East Hartford y Manchester, según un análisis de las tendencias de matriculación estudiantil realizado por Caitlin Richard, directora financiera de las Escuelas Públicas de Hartford, presentado en una reunión de la Junta de Educación en noviembre.
Esto es lo que sabemos sobre la pausa en las renovaciones de escuelas públicas.
¿Por qué las escuelas públicas de Hartford planearon renovaciones?
Los proyectos buscaban abordar problemas que llevan años arrastrándose en los edificios de las Escuelas Públicas de Hartford, como goteras en los techos y sistemas de climatización anticuados, e incorporar instalaciones de última generación. La presidenta de la Junta de Educación, Shonta Browdy, dijo que la falta de instalaciones de vanguardia aleja a los residentes de Hartford hacia distritos que sí las ofrecen.
Las renovaciones entonces, buscan abordar la baja matrícula actual en las escuelas públicas de Hartford.
¿Como es el proceso de construcción de escuelas y en qué momento se detuvo?
Es un proceso largo que involucra a múltiples actores interesados que proponen, supervisan y aprueban proyectos de renovación de la construcción de escuelas.
Primero, el distrito escolar identifica la necesidad de renovaciones. Consultores y otros profesionales pueden participar en el proceso de documentación, considerando la matrícula estudiantil, las necesidades del edificio y los programas académicos.
Luego, la Junta de Educación prepara las especificaciones educativas con los costos del proyecto y las cifras de matrícula para los próximos ocho años. Una vez que la ciudad las aprueba, la Junta y el Ayuntamiento están autorizados a presentar una solicitud de subvención al estado, y la Oficina de Subvenciones y Revisión de Construcción Escolar evalúa la propuesta.
Si la propuesta se aprueba, como fue el caso de las seis escuelas públicas de Hartford, el estado emite una carta de compromiso de subvención. El comité de construcción escolar de la ciudad contrata además a gerentes de programa y construcción, y a arquitectos.
Luego, antes de iniciar la licitación de las obras de construcción, que es autorizada por la oficina de construcción escolar del estado, se elaboran, revisan y aprueban los diseños. La construcción comienza entonces.
Los proyectos se suspendieron casi al final de este proceso. Las empresas constructoras ya presentaron sus ofertas y el Comité de Construcción Escolar de Hartford votó a favor de las propuestas de diseño para las escuelas.
A continuación, presentamos los nombres de las empresas constructoras seleccionadas, según la información proporcionada por Browdy:

S.A.N.D. tiene un contrato con Colliers;
Las escuelas primarias Sanchez y Batchelder con Arcadis y O&G;
McDonough Middle con PDS Engineering and Construction Inc.;
Parkville Community con 7 Summits Construction;
y la escuela primaria Moylan con Newfield Construction.

¿Qué dice el alcalde sobre su razonamiento para pausar las renovaciones de las escuelas?
Cristian Corza-Godinez, portavoz de la ciudad de Hartford, declaró por escrito que el ‘statu quo’ no beneficia a los estudiantes, por lo que el alcalde está trabajando en un plan de cinco años para convertir las escuelas en ‘centros de excelencia’. Añadió que esto requiere conversaciones alrededor de si la ciudad está agotando los recursos en las escuelas con baja matriculación.
Corza-Godinez sostuvo que, hasta que la ciudad tenga un plan para abordar este problema, pausar la construcción de las escuelas es la decisión responsable.
“Si usamos fondos estatales para llevar a cabo estos seis proyectos de construcción, las personas que pagan impuestos de Hartford quedarán obligados durante veinte años y tendrán que devolver ese dinero si alguna de esas seis escuelas toma un rumbo distinto en las próximas dos décadas”, dijo.
En la reunión del comité de construcción escolar del 20 de octubre, Lori Mizerak, asesora legal de la ciudad, declaró que envió un memorando el 17 de octubre sobre los planes de la ciudad para evaluar todas las escuelas de la ciudad que enfrentan problemas presupuestarios. El memorando no lo hicieron disponible al público.
¿Cuáles son los próximos pasos para estos proyectos?
Por el momento, las renovaciones están en pausa y no hay una fecha fija para la reanudación de la construcción.
Arulampalam aseguró que la ciudad desea reanudar la construcción lo antes posible y espera que todos los actores se reúnan para colaborar en un plan que ofrezca mejores resultados educativos a los estudiantes de Hartford, de modo que puedan ofrecer no solo edificios con mejor diseño, sino también una educación sustancialmente mejor.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7869-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 11:58:54.878487

(Submitted) TOPEKA — Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas and Topeka’s St. Francis hospital have failed to reach a contract agreement, leaving insurance customers out of network beginning Jan. 1 for one of Topeka’s major health care systems.
Officials with both organizations say discussions are ongoing. The current contract ends Dec. 31.
“We’re having productive talks,” said Matt All, president and CEO of BCBS of Kansas. “It’s a little complicated because they have an out-of-state owner, so we’re not just talking to people here on the ground.”
“I’m not in the business of making predictions, but our expectation is that we’ll work this out and that they’ll be in network,” he added.
Topeka’s St. Francis campus is owned by Ardent Health, which manages operations, and the University of Kansas Health System. Ardent is based in Brentwood, Tennessee.

People covered by BCBS of Kansas have been posting social media messages, upset about the possible loss of their doctors.
“I refuse to abandon my primary care provider whom I trust with my care, so Blue Cross Blue Shield just lost another customer,” said Topekan Carol Baldwin on her personal Facebook page.
In an emailed statement to Kansas Reflector, hospital officials said: “The University of Kansas Health System St. Francis Campus is committed to protecting access to high-quality care for our community. We have made repeated efforts to engage directly with senior decision-makers at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas and remain committed to negotiating in good faith to reach a fair resolution.”
Rising costs in health care are causing the challenge in reaching agreement, both sides said. For All, the discussions are indicative of broader problems throughout the health care system.
“We are seeking an agreement that reimburses St. Francis Campus at rates consistent with rising costs due to inflation and supply chain pressures,” the hospital’s statement said. “Equitable reimbursement rates are critical to supporting the high-quality care that our patients deserve.”
All said BCBS, which is a mutual nonprofit that is created to benefit its members, must negotiate so that reimbursements to the hospital are reasonable and don’t translate into premiums that members can’t afford.
“For the whole 19 years I’ve been with Blue Cross, and basically our whole history, we’ve had every hospital in our service area in network, and we want St. Francis in network,” he said.
Changes needed
There are many good things about the country’s health care, All said, but the availability of resources isn’t evenly spread out.
“We have too many people that can’t afford coverage,” All said. “The big problem in American health care that’s existed for as long as any of us have been thinking about this is that it doesn’t control costs very well, and so there’s this steady rise in costs over the decades, and some decades are faster than others.”
For the years 2024 through 2033, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicts that national health expenditures will grow 5.8%.
“Across the industry, in every market, whether you’re talking about commercial plans, the public programs and so forth, costs are rising really quickly right now,” All said. “We’ve seen it in our plan and when you combine that with possibly losing some of the subsidies in the (Affordable Care Act) market, you’re going to have some consumers that are just going to be priced out of the market.”
“That should be unacceptable to us,” All added. “In 2025, in a nation as prosperous as ours, we should be able to make sure that everybody can afford good health care.”
The health care system needs a major overhaul, All said, but having what he called an “adult conversation” on the topic is difficult.
“We need to really talk about the root causes of higher costs and the toll that takes, but also the consequences of controlling costs, because there’s another side to this,” he said. “The fact that we’re able to have two beautiful hospitals in Topeka, two great hospitals in Wichita, a beautiful hospital in Lawrence, and you can actually go there and get care — that is partly because we fund our health care system really lavishly.”
But that system isn’t working if people don’t have access to it, All said.
“If we solve the cost problem, we can solve all of the other problems,” he said. “The other problems are just technical. At that point, we have to get the cost problem solved, and we just haven’t been willing to do it yet as a country.”
Health expenses
The Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that focuses on affordable health care, compared U.S. health care costs to those in 12 countries. It found the U.S. pays more for:

Insurance administrative costs, responsible for about 15% of the excess costs.
Administrative activities, 15% of excess.
Prescription drugs, 10% of excess.
Physician salaries, 10% of excess.
Registered nurse salaries, 5% of excess.
Investments in medical machinery and equipment, less than 5%. 

The U.S. industry is highly concentrated, All said, with about 20% of health care dollars spent on 1% of the population and more than half of health care dollars on about 5% of the population. Those are patients with chronic diseases, people with metastatic cancer, babies born prematurely and others, he said.
“In some ways that makes it easier to address because you’re talking about a smaller set of the population, but I think it actually makes it much harder to address because these are people who very much need care, and we want them to have the best care that’s available,” he said. “So how do you make that less expensive? That is the conundrum that we face in American health care.”
It’s important to make sure healthy people are covered by insurance, which was the point of the ACA mandate that required everyone to have insurance, All said. That mandate was struck down but the ACA covers about one in every six people under age 65, or about 44 million people, according to KFF, which tracks health policies. 
“If you only cover people who have the costliest care then, then they won’t be able to afford it at all. None of us could,” he said. 
All said it’s frustrating to hear people against ACA subsidies say that “most people don’t use the care anyway.”
“You would never have auto insurance, for example, where only people who get into wrecks pay their auto premium,” he said.
All said smaller towns, in particular, could be in jeopardy of losing access to local health care services with Medicaid cuts and the possibility of ACA subsidies not being renewed.
Many Kansas hospitals are in difficult financial condition with rising costs. The Kansas Hospital Association said non-reimbursed care costs continue to rise for community hospitals. In 2023, the amount was over $26 billion, and since 2015 non-reimbursed care has increased by 77%.
All said insurance companies have a responsibility to be stewards of the health care industry and work to make sure care is affordable and available.
“I think there’s a lot of criticism that’s fair of the insurance industry, but it’s not really the reason why health care costs keep going up,” All said. “It is really because we have decided that we’re going to have a system that is really rich for some people and not so rich for others and unavailable for others. Until we make a real commitment to universal coverage that’s affordable, we’re going to be in this fix.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TUKHS-St.-Francis-Campus-Entrance-A--1024x676.jpg,,,2025-12-01 11:58:54.878487

“Action must be taken immediately to protect consumers, combat illegal monopolies and ensure these corporations are not criminally profiting at the expense of the American people,” Trump said in a social media post.
On Nov. 7, the White House published four claims in support of the investigation. Investigate Midwest fact-checked those claims.
Claim: The Trump administration stated, “The ‘Big Four’ meat packers — JBS (Brazil), Cargill, Tyson Foods, and National Beef — currently dominate 85% of the U.S. beef processing market, up from just 36% in 1980.”
True. These four companies (Marfrig owns National Beef) control roughly 85% of the U.S. beef industry, including owning more than 70 meat brands like Hillshire Farm, Swift, Honeysuckle and Jimmy Dean, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Claim: In calling for a DOJ investigation, the Trump administration said: “For too long, a handful of giant meat packers have squeezed America’s cattle producers, shrunk herds, and jacked up prices at the grocery store.”
Partly true. There is evidence that the consolidation of meatpackers has led to a decrease in the price ranchers are paid for their cattle.
However, a USDA study found that consolidation contributed to lower production costs, which in turn led to lower costs at the grocery store.
“Lower production costs did translate into lower consumer prices, increased consumption, and higher prices for cattle and hogs,” according to a 2024 USDA report. “However, with fewer rivals because of increased concentration, most of the studies found packers were also able to exercise some market power and pay lower prices for cattle than they would have had they faced more competitors.”
It is true that beef prices have increased for consumers in recent years, and the margin between cattle prices and retail prices has widened (indicating packer margins have grown). But many economic observers note that price increases at the grocery store have been mostly influenced by factors such as labor, transportation and input costs.
Claim: The Trump administration said, “Industry consolidation has crushed competition and hammered cattle producers.”
True. Since the 1970s, the nation’s cattle supply has become increasingly consolidated by larger meatpacking companies. An often cited USDA report from 2000 first highlighted the rate of “four-firm control,” or the measure of the beef industry’s outputs controlled by its four largest producers, which was 25% in 1971.
By 1992, the rate had jumped to 71%, and today it hovers around 85%.
Large plants across the country account for the majority of all slaughter. Just 12 federally inspected plants produced slightly less than half of the country’s beef supply as of 2022, according to an Investigate Midwest data analysis.
The nation’s cattle ranchers have faced increased consolidation in modern times, leaving them with few options when selling their herds to slaughter, often only able to accept a single large meatpacker as their buyer in their region.
Claim: Finally, the Trump administration claimed that the monopolization of the meatpacking industry has led to the exploitation of American consumers, farmers, and ranchers.” The administration went on to state: “In fact, mounting evidence shows this monopoly power has slashed payments to ranchers, reduced herd sizes, driven up consumer prices, and threatened America’s food supply chain.”
Partly true. American consumers have seen increased costs in numerous pantry staples in recent years. This increase can be attributed to rising inflation, COVID-19 supply chain disruptions, disease outbreaks and price-gouging.
Monopoly power in meatpacking isn’t the sole cause of the nation’s historic low cattle inventory. This low can also be attributed to climate-change-fueled droughts disrupting cattle feed and replacement cycles in the industry.
Consolidated power in the meat industry has disrupted the nation’s food supply in recent years.
A cyberattack on U.S. JBS plants in May 2021 resulted in ripple effects of delayed production. A 2019 fire at a Tyson slaughter plant in Kansas resulted in a 27% drop in cattle traded on the market during the following week, as the plant remained closed, according to a USDA incident report.
A disruption at these pivotal points in the food supply, no matter the cause, has a cascading effect on the entire food supply chain, from ranchers to consumers.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana House Republicans released Monday a proposed redrawing of the state’s congressional maps aimed at producing a 9-0 Republican U.S. House delegation.
The proposed map splits strongly Democratic Indianapolis among four districts that all stretch far into rural, heavily Republican counties.
The map obliterates the current 7th District now held by Democratic Rep. André Carson. The new 7th District would span from the north side of Indianapolis to counties along the Ohio River near Cincinnati.
Draft_CD_2025_Counties__Townships
The Lake Michigan shoreline area that now makes up the 1st District held by Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan also is split up. Republicans propose a new 1st District taking in Democratic-friendly Lake County then heading southeast to take in the areas around the small cities of Logansport, Peru and Wabash.
Indiana House members are scheduled to meet Monday afternoon to start the process of considering the congressional redistricting that President Donald Trump has been demanding for months to improve the chances of Republicans keeping their slim majority in the U.S. House.
House Republicans will announce today who will carry the bill as well as information on public hearings. In 2021, lawmakers held 14 hearings around the state and in Indianapolis.
The state Senate, where several Republican senators have expressed opposition to the redistricting, is expected to meet next week.
Trump won each of the districts under the proposed map by at least 12 percentage points in the 2024 election, according to an analysis by Indianapolis City-County Councilor Nick Roberts, a Democrat.
Trump’s narrowest win was in the proposed 1st District, where Republican Gov. Mike Braun won by a 6 percentage point margin, according to Roberts.

Developers’ efforts to overturn the cancellation of a vast gold and copper mine planned for southwest Alaska are getting a boost from national mining and pro-business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
On Nov. 24 and Nov. 25, the Chamber and the National Mining Association filed separate friend-of-the-court briefs in the lawsuit brought by the developers of the proposed Pebble Mine against the Environmental Protection Agency, which vetoed the mine.
Neither group has intervened in the case against the EPA, but the briefs represent the groups’ support for the proposed mine and offer legal arguments that Judge Sharon Gleason could consider as she debates whether to move the project forward.
In 2023, the EPA invoked a rarely used “veto” clause of the Clean Water Act to say that there was no way that the proposed Pebble Mine could be developed without significant harm to the environment. The large mineral deposit is located at the headwaters of Bristol Bay, the most abundant sockeye salmon fishery in the world.
The administration of Gov. Mike Dunleavy, which supports the project, and the proposed mine’s developers, filed separate lawsuits in federal court to overturn the rejection, as did two Native corporations that work as contractors for the developers. Those cases have since been combined.
The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case directly, which has left the issue in front of Judge Sharon Gleason in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska.
Another lawsuit filed by the state claims that if the veto is upheld, the federal government will owe Alaska $700 billion, the state’s estimate for the value of the mine if built as planned. That case has been put on hold until the District Court rules.
In July, the administration of President Donald Trump indicated that it might try to settle the suit and withdraw the veto. If that occurs, it could come before Jan. 2, when the EPA is slated to file a written response to the plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment. 
If the EPA continues to fight the case, the last written arguments are scheduled to be finished by the end of February. Any oral argument would take place afterward.
If the federal government drops the case, it doesn’t mean a free path for Pebble: Several environmental organizations, fishing groups, tribal organizations and Bristol Bay locals have also intervened in the case and intend to fight in court. 
The Alaska Legislature is also expected to consider a bill that would block both Pebble and any successor projects that might emerge.
In its brief, the National Mining Association — joined by the American Exploration and Mining Association and the Alaska Miners Association — call the EPA’s veto “overly broad” and say that if it is upheld, the act “will almost certainly chill investment in domestic mining activities” because other proposed mines could also be subject to a veto.
The Chamber of Commerce, which has backed the Pebble Mine project since at least 2022, said that if the veto is upheld, it has the potential of encouraging other vetoes, which would “disrupt important industries in which many of the Chamber’s members participate.”

Sensory exercises like this are often used in special education classrooms. (Getty Images)TOPEKA — An autism spectrum diagnosis can be confounding for some families.
For years, parents and caregivers had little support or guidance to provide the best outcomes for children with autism.
Often, the most they were given was a packet of information, said Linda Heitzman-Powell, a professor in pediatrics for the University of Kansas and a lead researcher for an autism training program.
“It always felt like that we were setting them adrift at sea with no sail and no oars,” Heitzman-Powell said on the Kansas Reflector podcast.


But roughly 25 years ago, Heitzman-Powell and a small handful of doctors began training service providers in how to foster a stable family when a child has an autism spectrum diagnosis.
Parents expressed interest in the training, so Heitzman-Powell, with federal grant funding, created a parent-focused program through the University of Kansas Medical Center and studied its efficacy. The program is called OASIS, or Online and Applied Systems of Intervention Skills.
“It’s teaching parents the fundamental skills or procedures or practices that are inherent in an evidence-based approach, so they can take it with them in life, whether it be to grandma’s house, whether it be, you know, going trick-or-treating, whether it be going to get their hair cut or going out to eat,” said Heitzman-Powell, who was not speaking on behalf of the KU Medical Center. “I just think it’s important that parents are empowered.”
A recent federal funding award has allowed the program to expand further and develop a Spanish-language ambassador framework. The program previously included bilingual resources and cultural accommodations, Heitzman-Powell said, but the funding allows researchers to go deeper.
That means considering how Hispanic and Latino families obtain information, who families will trust and listen to and how to provide further support.
“Our impetus was families,” Heitzman-Powell said. “It always has been. It’s identifying a need of families in the field and then trying to develop programs that can address that, and then diligently working to get that program back out into the field.”
The program’s ultimate purpose is to develop evidence-based strategies that can be easily incorporated into everyday life, she said.
Part of the purpose, too, is advocacy.
In Heitzman-Powell’s work, the need to correct misperceptions began with debunked theories. One was dubbed “refrigerator moms,” an untrue claim that emotionally cold mothers cause autism in children. Another theorized that a gluten- and casein-free diet could prevent autism, which has not been backed by science.
Correlation is not causation, Heitzman-Powell said.
She has run into similar rhetoric in unsubstantiated claims that certain vaccines cause autism, including directly from the current top U.S. health official.
Autism encompasses a wide range of different behavioral, intellectual, developmental and emotional and mental health symptoms.
New fads always arise, Heitzman-Powell said, including ones that tout purported cures to autism. There are none, but autism is treatable.
“The cure that we know works is a lot of hard work,” Heitzman-Powell said. “And it’s being able to break all those behaviors down into their incremental pieces and systematically teaching them and putting them back together until you come up with this really wonderful, warm, kind, caring, beautiful, little individual that has the ability to be as independent as possible.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-1088179758-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-01 09:56:14.320393
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-01 14:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Here’s why everyone’s talking about a ‘K-shaped’ economy,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/01/what-is-the-k-shaped-economy/,A big reason the term is popping up so often is that it helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — From corporate executives to Wall Street analysts to Federal Reserve officials, references to the “K-shaped economy” are rapidly proliferating.
So what does it mean? Simply put, the upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise while the bottom part points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices.
A big reason the term is popping up so often is that it helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and the unemployment rate has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth is slowing.
It also captures ongoing concerns around affordability, which is much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households. Persistent inflation has received renewed political attention after voter anger over costly rents, groceries, and imported goods helped Democrats win several high-profile elections last month.
“Those at the bottom are living with the cumulative impacts of price inflation,” said Peter Atwater, an economics professor at William & Mary in Virginia. “At the same time, those at the top are benefiting from the cumulative impact of asset inflation.”
Here are some things to know about the K-shaped economy:
Not an L, U or V
Atwater actually popularized the label “K-shaped economy” during the pandemic after seeing it crop up on social media. Other economists were discussing different letters to describe how the COVID recession in 2020 could play out: Would it be a V-shaped recovery, meaning a sharp decline and then rapid bounce-back? Or would it be U-shaped, meaning a more gradual rebound? Or, worse, L-shaped: A recession followed by extended stagnation.
“There was sort of this land-grab for letters,” Atwater said. “To me the letter that made the most sense was K.”
Back then, it captured the differing fortunes between white-collar professionals still employed and working at home while stock prices rose, even as massive layoffs at factories, restaurants, and entertainment venues pushed unemployment to nearly 15%.
Inequality persists
Inequality was somewhat reversed in the aftermath of the pandemic, when businesses offered large raises for blue collar workers as the economy reopened and demand surged. Many companies — restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues — were caught short-staffed and sought to rapidly increase hiring. Lower-income workers saw larger pay gains than higher-paid ones.
In 2023 and 2024, inflation-adjusted wages for the bottom quarter of workers rose at a yearly rate of 3.9%, outpacing the 3.1% gains for the top quarter, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.
“We had that kind of two-year period where the bottom was catching up and that talk of the K-shape went away,” Dario Perkins, an economist at TSLombard, said. “And since then, the economy’s cooled down again,” he added, bringing back K-shape references.
This year, however, inflation-adjusted wage growth has weakened as hiring has fallen, with the drop more pronounced for lower-income Americans. Their wage growth has plunged to an annual rate of just 1.5%, the Minneapolis Fed found, below that of the highest earning quarter of workers at 2.4%.
Slower income growth has left many lower-income workers less able to spend. Based on data from its credit card and debit card customers, Bank of America found that spending among higher-income households rose 2.7% in October compared with a year ago, while lower-income groups lagged at just 0.7%.
And a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study in August found that consumer spending in recent years has been driven by richer households, while lower- and middle-income Americans have piled up more credit card debt even as they’ve spent less.
Businesses take note
Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers.
Henrique Braun, chief operating officer at Coca-Cola, for example, said in late October that the company is pursuing both “affordability” and “premiumization.” It is generating more of its earnings from higher-end products such as its Smartwater and Fairlife filtered milk brands, while at the same time introducing mini cans for those looking to spend less.
“We continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said in a conference call with analysts last month. “The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there.”
Sales of first- and business-class tickets have been fueling revenue and profit for Delta Air Lines, its CEO Ed Bastian said in October, while lower-end consumers have been “clearly struggling.”
And Best Buy CEO Corie Barry on Tuesday said that the top 40% of all U.S. consumers are driving two-thirds of all consumption.
The remaining 60% are focused on getting the best deals and are more dependent on a healthy job market, she said.
“One of the things we’re watching closely is how does employment continue to evolve for particularly that cohort of people who are living more paycheck to paycheck,” she added.
AI plays a role
The massive investment in data centers and computing power has also contributed to the K-shaped economy, by lifting share prices for the so-called “Magnificent 7” companies competing to build out AI Infrastructure. Yet so far it’s not creating many jobs or lifting incomes for those who don’t own stocks.
“What we see at the very top is an economy that is sort of self-contained … between AI, the stock market, the experiences of the wealthy,” Atwater said. “And it’s largely contained. It doesn’t flow through to the bottom.”
Driven by big gains for companies like Google, Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft, the stock market has risen nearly 15% this year. But the wealthiest 10% of Americans own roughly 87% of the stock market, according to Federal Reserve data. The poorest 50% own just 1.1%.
K-shape comes with concerns
Many economists worry that an economy propelled mostly by the wealthiest isn’t sustainable. Perkins notes that should layoffs worsen and unemployment rise, middle- and lower-income Americans could pull back sharply on spending. Revenue for companies like Apple and Amazon would fall. Advertising revenue, which is fueling companies such as Google and Facebook parent Meta, typically plunges in downturns.
Such a cycle could even force the “Mag 7” to pull back on their AI investments and send the economy into recession, he said.
“Then you’re talking about the bottom of the K essentially pulling down the top,” he added.
Perkins, however, sees a different path as more likely: Many U.S. households will receive larger tax refunds early next year under the Trump administration’s budget law. And Trump will likely appoint a new Federal Reserve chair by next May who will be more inclined to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs could accelerate growth and wages, though it could also worsen inflation.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25330618688087-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-01 14:57:13.655869

Chris looks back at the end of year lawmaking hustle, and what was left for 2026, then turns to a possibly record-smashing number of ballot questions that could land before voters next November.","EPISODE INFO

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Chris Lisinski







AS LAWMAKERS MADE a final push last month at the end of formal sessions for the year, the state’s real political energy wasn’t centered under the Golden Dome. It was in supermarket parking lots and coffee shops where signature gatherers made a final dash to gather the required support to place ballot questions before voters next year. A potential record number of 2026 ballot measures have cleared that significant hurdle, setting the stage for a second half of the two-year legislative session consumed by outside pressure for policy change. 
CommonWealth Beacon reporters Jennifer Smith and Chris Lisinski dug into the dawning ballot season and reviewed the end-of-session scramble on The Codcast.  
Voters could see as many as a dozen ballot questions at the polls next November. Ballot referendums – inherently blunt instruments – are tools to prod lawmakers to take action as much as efforts to create law themselves. And several take aim at the state’s notoriously opaque and uncompetitive political system. 
Ballot efforts to subject the governor’s office, the House, and the Senate to public records laws and rein in legislative stipends are successor referendums of a sort, after last cycle’s successful initiative authorizing the state auditor to audit the Legislature, which has stalled. “Thematically, all of this falls under the exact same umbrella that has long been hoisted,” Lisinski noted, “criticizing Massachusetts as one of the least transparent state legislatures in the country.”  
Both legislative chambers okayed bills to retool the embattled Cannabis Control Commission. 
“Legislative leaders have tried to downplay the degree to which the controversies at the commission, specifically between chair Shannon O’Brien and Treasurer Deb Goldberg, prompted this legislation,” Lisinski said. “They’ve really pitched the bill as just a necessary update, so many years into this industry, to buff out some rough areas that practice has shown don’t work as well as needed. That being said, we’re all free and independent thinkers, and we can connect the dots that this significant industry overhaul has only started to move now after a very long series of controversies.” 
Meanwhile, a ballot measure that could come before voters next November seeks to recriminalize recreational cannabis just a decade after voters took to the ballot box to legalize it. 
The ballot question would roll back the clock to before the 2016 ballot measure that legalized recreational use of marijuana. While proponents say they have submitted enough signatures to clear the first hurdle – not without controversy – Bay State voters have not signaled a broad appetite to undo the earlier measure. A 2024 poll on cannabis policy from the MassINC Polling Group, which is partially owned by CommonWealth Beacon’s publisher MassINC, found 65 percent of respondents said legalizing marijuana in the state was “the right decision.” 
November 19 marked the end of this year’s formal sessions under internal legislative rules. Major bills that didn’t reach the governor are likely on hold until 2026. But Massachusetts lawmaking is famously backloaded—most major action happens in the final weeks of the second year, not the first. 
As lawmakers downshift into informal sessions for the remainder of 2025, the Legislature cleared a $2 billion closeout budget last month for fiscal 2025. Beyond MassHealth funding and money for sheriffs and World Cup tourism, the bill imposed new oversight on sheriff spending and decoupled state vaccine schedules from federal recommendations – a preemptive move against potential changes under vaccine-wary Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
The House punted on its energy bill after attempting to rewrite Gov. Maura Healey’s affordability proposal to weaken the state’s 2030 decarbonization targets. Budget chief Aaron Michlewitz pulled it after strong blowback.

Paid leave grants Minnesota workers up to 12 weeks of family leave and 12 weeks of medical leave per year, capped at 20 weeks in a single year. Employers and workers will pay into a fund through a payroll tax, and wages are determined by a wage-based formula — the maximum a person on leave can receive is $1,423 per week.
Most people will start to see a payroll tax deduction in their paychecks beginning in January. The rate for the first year is 0.88%, which will be split between employers and their employees. Most workers will pay half, or 44 cents for every $100 in taxable wages.
Minnesota is planning to open up applications for baby bonding leave prior to the Jan. 1 launch date to allow parents to get their paid leave applications in early. The Department of Employment and Economic Development said applications will open in early December.
Paid leave is a big — and sometimes confusing — state program. Here are some common questions about it.
Who qualifies?
Nearly every employer and worker.
Full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary workers all qualify. People with multiple jobs can also take leave from one or more of their employers.
Federal employees, postal workers, and self-employed and independent contractors aren’t covered by default; all but federal workers can choose to opt into the plan.
If your employer offers a paid leave program that is the same or more generous than the state’s, then there’s a chance you won’t have access to the state’s paid leave, but in that case you won’t have to pay the tax. Ask your employer if you are covered by the paid leave program.
If someone works in more than one state, they can receive paid leave if they work at least 50% of the time in Minnesota. This includes people that work from home.
I had a child in 2025: Can I take leave in 2026?
Parents who welcomed a child into their home in 2025 will be able to claim paid leave benefits in 2026, even if they’ve already taken leave through their employer. These parents can qualify for up to 12 weeks of paid leave as long as their application is approved within one year of welcoming a child, including a new baby, adoption and foster placement.
I’m pregnant. How do I get paid leave next year?
Plan when you want to use paid leave in 2026. You can take up to 12 weeks of family leave to bond with your newborn child, adopted child or foster placement. You can also take up to 12 weeks of medical leave to recover from serious health events, including childbirth.
If you take both family and medical leave in a single year, you can take up to 20 weeks total of paid leave.
You must notify your employer at least 30 days before your leave. Talk to your employer about other leaves and payments you could take. For example, some employers will allow their workers to use their accumulated paid time off to “top off” the payments you receive from the state so you receive your normal wages while on leave.
Your employer will be notified that you have submitted an application to take paid leave.
Applications require certification from a health care provider. Work with your provider to obtain a PDF of a qualifying document that you can attach to your paid leave application.
For bonding leave, you can use a birth certificate, hospital discharge document or adoption or foster placement paperwork.
The state is working to update the application process so you don’t have to get documentation directly from your provider, but it will not be ready by initial launch.
Do I have to take my leave all at once?
No.
I need surgery and time to recover. How do I get paid leave?
You can take up to 12 weeks of medical leave to recover from an illness or injury.
You can take leave if you have a qualifying event that lasts at least seven days, but the days don’t need to be consecutive. For example, if you need to attend regular medical appointments that total seven days, you can get payments for the days you are on leave from work.
On a similar note, your leave doesn’t need to be taken all at once. For example, if you feel well enough to return to work but experience flare-ups of pain, you can take the leave only when you need it. You won’t receive wages for the entire week, just the days you were on leave.
For intermittent medical leave — like pain flare-ups — you will need to work with your health care provider and employer to get approval to take off specific days.
If the leave is unplanned, let your employer know as soon as you can and fill out your paid leave application.
Applications for medical leave must include certification from your health care provider. You will need to work with your health care provider to obtain a form that you can attach to your application.
As with leave for babies, the state is working to update the application process so applicants do not have to get documentation directly from their providers, but it will not be ready by initial launch.
Workers can also take up to 12 weeks to care for a family member with a health condition. The family member doesn’t need to be located in Minnesota, but their health care provider is required to certify that that worker is the designated caretaker. “Family member” is widely defined.
It includes immediate family — including spouses — grandchildren or grandparents, sons- or daughters-in-law and any person “who has a personal relationship with the applicant that creates an expectation and reliance for care,” according to the state.
How much will I be paid? 
Minnesota’s paid leave is intended as a partial wage replacement, so you won’t get your full pay.
To receive the payments, you need to have made least $3,900 in the past year. This can be from multiple jobs. The payments are based on your average weekly wage.
For weekly wages between zero and $711.50, you will get paid 90% of these wages.
For everything you make between $711.50 and $1,423, you will get paid 66% of these weekly wages.
For everything above $1,423, you will get paid 55% of these weekly wages.
It works like marginal tax rates.
So, for instance, if you make $1,500 per week, you’ll receive:

90% of $711.50, or $640; 
plus 66% of the next $711.50 or $470; 
plus 55% of the final $77, or $42. 

Add them up, and you get about $1,152.
Your weekly payment cannot exceed $1,423. You can estimate your payment by using the state’s tool.
How much will I be taxed?
Payroll tax deductions for nearly all workers begin in January. The rate for the first year is 0.88%, which will be split between employers and their employees. Most employees will pay half, or 44 cents for every $100 in taxable wages.
Employers can choose to pay more than their required share.
A payroll tax cannot cause an employee to earn less than minimum wage, so employers may have to assume more of the payroll tax.
Minnesota’s paid leave program will have an income ceiling, above which people won’t be taxed. Minnesotans will not be taxed on income above $184,000.
The state will evaluate the solvency of the paid leave program and set a payroll tax rate each year. This means the tax could be higher than 0.88% in the future, though officials cannot raise it above 1.1%, according to state law.
You can estimate your paid leave tax with the state’s premium calculator.
How does paid leave work for small businesses?
Businesses that employ 30 or fewer people and have an average employee wage under 150% of the state average pay — $1423 — will be required to participate in the paid leave program. Like other businesses, they can be excluded if they offer a paid leave program that is the same or more generous than the state’s.
Small businesses will pay a reduced payroll tax of 0.66%. An employer must pay at least 0.22%, while an employee can only pay up to 0.44%.
Minnesota lawmakers created a Small Employer Assistance Grant program, which subsidizes small businesses that have trouble when an employee takes leave. The grants can help with the hiring of temporary workers or for training new staff while an employee is out on leave.
Grants will be up to $3,000 per leave or $6,000 per employer.
What will the state do to prevent fraud in the program?
Fraudsters in recent years have bilked hundreds of millions from Minnesota’s public programs, and state officials are working to ensure paid leave doesn’t become another, they say.
Minnesota will implement a new login system — LoginMN — that will require paid leave applicants to create an account, upload a picture of their driver’s license and take a real-time selfie. This is to help prevent artificial intelligence programs from creating accounts to apply for paid leave.
The application process requires several verification steps by the employer, worker, health provider and the state. Employers are able to review their workers’ leave application and flag inconsistencies.
All applications for leave require certification from a health care provider, and the provider must sign off on the duration of leave. For intermittent leave, the provider must sign off on the duration for each time period.
State officials will use data analytics to help catch anomalies. The state officials say they will refer cases for criminal prosecution if they suspect fraud.
Every application will be reviewed, and the paid leave program will be randomly audited.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Throughout the winter, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources will monitor applications of an approved herbicide, in very low doses, to the water at Clear Lake to eradicate invasive plant species. 
Eurasian watermilfoil and curly-leaf pondweed are non-native plants that are easily spread to wetlands and other lakes.  The plants can also impact recreation on the lake. 
Scott Grummer, a fisheries management biologist at Clear Lake with DNR said the herbicide, Sonar A.S., will only impact the non-native plant species because it is being applied during a season when native aquatic plants have already died back.

Grummer said DNR went out in a handful of boats in early November to spread the herbicide in strips through the center of the lake. He said they let “Mother Nature do that initial mixing” to spread the chemical throughout the water. 
The department is sampling and testing the lake water to keep herbicide concentrations at the recommended level of above 3 parts per billion, and to determine if additional “bumps” of the herbicide are needed. A bump, he said, will likely be applied in December, which might mean staff have to drill holes into an iced-over lake.
While it’s unlikely many Iowans are slipping into their water skis this time of year, Grummer said the herbicide is applied in such a low dose that there are no water use restrictions in place at the lake. 
“Even if we were in the middle of summer, there’d be no swimming, boating, water use restrictions at all,” Grummer said.
Fishing and irrigation are also still OK on Clear Lake during the treatment period, which is expected to continue until the middle of January. 
Grummer said the herbicide is very “slow acting” so the “true evidence of success” for the treatment won’t be known until the department conducts a vegetation survey in 2026. 
The herbicide starves the plants over a number of weeks by preventing it from producing a pigment necessary for photosynthesis. 
Grummer said the treatment has been successful at a number of other Iowa lakes, including Crystal Lake, East Okoboji and Lake Cornelia. 
“We’ve done enough of them, we know what works,” Grummer said. “As long as we can hold that concentration, we’ve been successful in other systems at eradicating this Eurasian watermilfoil, and that’s the goal with this project.” 
Grummer said this project took about a year to plan and is funded by DNR’s lake restoration program and support from local partners. 
Eurasian watermilfoil grows at deep depths, as tall as 12 to 15 feet, which Grummer said can be a nuisance to water recreation. 
The plant spreads via fragmentation. Like an easy-to-propagate houseplant, a small segment and some water is enough to grow roots and spread. 
“All you need is a little piece to get a population started,” Grummer said. 
This factor means it’s especially important for boaters and anglers to follow good boat hygiene practices. Grummer said the basics, regardless of if a known invasive species is present or not, are to clean, drain and dry before transporting anything from a lake or river.
“We probably have boaters come from all over Iowa (to Clear Lake) and it’s just a really needed project, just to kind of cut off these invasives the best we can,” Grummer said.

The Missouri Department of Corrections recorded his death as an accident and offered few additional details. His family requested records from the prison’s investigation into his death, documents such as the internal investigative report that might paint a fuller picture of Lancaster’s last moments. But their requests for more information were “largely ignored,” according to their lawyer, Joe Allen.
It wasn’t until they reached out to the county coroner who handled Lancaster’s body that his family learned the 39-year-old had been in a restrictive housing unit for over two weeks when he died from a fentanyl overdose.
In March, Lancaster’s mother, Mary Harris, filed a wrongful death suit against the prison system. The coroner’s records, including a death certificate ruling Lancaster’s death a homicide, provided the basis for Harris’ lawsuit alleging that prison officials failed to properly care for her son.  
“Alan was in solitary confinement and somehow dies of a fentanyl overdose,” Allen said. “How do you get fentanyl while you’re in solitary confinement?”

When someone dies in a Missouri prison, the prison system is required to provide certain information to families about the death. Staff should notify emergency contacts of the death and explain how to access the deceased’s medical records, according to the Missouri DOC’s communications director. For more information, families or their attorneys can submit records requests. State law dictates that even if certain records are normally closed, the DOC should provide families access to those documents “for purposes of investigation.”
But families of people who died in prison and their attorneys told The Marshall Project – St. Louis that the DOC doesn’t always follow its own policies. Left with unanswered questions about how their loved ones died, some have instead turned to the coroner. 
While coroners are elected officials generally responsible for investigating violent or unexpected deaths in their county, Missouri’s statute requires coroners to “fully investigate the essential facts” surrounding every death in custody, regardless of how it happened. The information from their investigations can help families find a sense of closure — and when deaths are suspected to be the result of abuse or neglect, a coroner’s investigation can also play a role in holding the prison system accountable. 
Unlike states such as New York that have medical boards to review deaths behind bars and mandate policy changes, coroners provide the only guarantee of outside scrutiny when someone dies in a Missouri prison. And although people who die in custody each year are particularly vulnerable to disappearing from public record, the statutes governing exactly how coroners conduct their investigations contain almost no record-keeping requirements. 
Historically, these policies have granted coroners wide discretion in how thoroughly to investigate, resulting in an uneven standard of prison death investigations across the state. 
Now, in Missouri and across the country, a coalition of forensic scientists, public health researchers and legal experts is pushing for more robust policy and oversight to hold every prison death investigator to the same high bar. 

“The coroner really is, in many places, the only opportunity for outside review or oversight,” said Dr. Roger Mitchell, president of the National Medical Association and co-author of the book “Death in Custody.” “So states need to take control over their death investigation apparatus, ensuring that there’s uniformity.”
When Tanekka Guest’s husband, Christopher, died at South Central prison in October 2023, she struggled to learn the truth about his death from prison officials. All the warden told her when he broke the news was that her husband died in his sleep, Guest said. 
“I was like, ‘How? What happened?’” she recalled. “The warden just said, ‘I’ll let you know more information when we get it.’”
Guest said she called the prison nearly every day for a month to speak to the warden, but he was never available. Eventually, she spoke to an investigator, who told her she would receive a flash drive with the contents of her husband’s tablet. Neither the flash drive nor the information she was promised ever came, she said. 
“They said they would let me know when they had the cause of death — they never did that, never told me any information,” she added. “It was just one pushback after another.” 
Details about her husband’s cause of death ultimately came from the county coroner, who called Guest to explain what happened: After a period of suicidal ideation, her husband overdosed on fentanyl and died. Guest said the biggest difference between her communication with the coroner and the prison was the follow-up. 
For weeks, Guest said she called the prison and never received any details. But every time she called the coroner, she got an answer. If she left a voicemail, it was promptly returned. 
“Talking to her was so comforting because she kept it 100% honest,” Guest said. “She said everything she could to put your heart and mind at ease.” 
Karen Pojmann, the DOC’s communications director, said the prison system “doesn’t withhold death information from families.” Autopsy reports, conducted by the medical examiner, are available to anyone who requests them, she said. Reports from the department’s internal death investigations are technically open to the public, but Pojmann said they can be closed or heavily redacted “for a variety of reasons, including … sensitive information that could compromise the security of the facility.” 
Although no agency or department keeps an official count, there are numerous reported instances of families filing lawsuits in recent years against the Missouri Department of Corrections to try to get information about the deceased’s final moments in prison. Families in Missouri describe being repeatedly stonewalled by prison officials. 
In one instance, an appeals court ordered the DOC to pay a mother over $60,000 in penalties and court fees for failing to provide video footage and the prison’s internal investigation of her son’s suicide in 2021. In another case, a court ordered the DOC to pay $5,000 after ruling that officials “knowingly and purposefully violated” public records law by refusing to provide video and other investigative records to another woman whose son was beaten to death in prison that same year. 
“They don’t hear back from the Department of Corrections, or they’ll deny a lot of records requests,” said Lori Curry, executive director of the advocacy group Missouri Prison Reform, of families’ experiences with the prison system. “It can really break your spirit to try to find out the truth about something and continually run into brick walls.”
The coroner’s independence from the prison system can mean they are emboldened to be direct and honest with families about how someone died, death in custody researchers noted. Coroners have the ability to freely hand over information like autopsy reports and death certificates. By contrast, limited oversight and the risk of being held legally liable for a death behind bars creates an incentive for prison officials to either cover up or misattribute causes of death.
After Christopher Scroggins died at South Central in June 2022 at the age of 23, the Department of Corrections listed his manner of death as “unknown.” But when an attorney representing the family requested the coroner’s records, he learned that Scroggins’ death was actually due to a fentanyl overdose. 
The attorney, Geoff Meyercord, said he wasn’t afraid to sue the DOC for more details if necessary, despite facing what he described as considerable pushback and roadblocks. But protracted litigation, and having to relive the death again and again, can be a significant emotional burden for families, he said. Particularly for families who are just looking to answer basic questions about their loved one’s death, it’s often just easier to ask the coroner. 
“We always want to take the path of least resistance if we can,” he said.  
When families do choose to file a lawsuit against the prison for a wrongful or preventable death, experts say coroner records can be critical to building a case. In Lancaster’s case, the family’s repeated attempts to get records from prison officials or from the DOC went unanswered. “All the agencies have collectively failed and refused to comply with the law and produce the requested documents, conspiring to and engaging in a cover-up,” the complaint states, causing  the family “extreme mental and emotional pain, suffering and anguish.”
By contrast, the coroner’s report was provided without protest and offered crucial details, including that a corrections officer was reportedly “fired over the episode” two days after Lancaster died. 
“Lancaster was murdered while in the custody and care of MDOC,” the complaint alleges. “The Department of Corrections … abjectly failed in their duty of care to Lancaster, resulting in his preventable homicide.” 
The lawyer for Lancaster’s family noted he “ would not have made that specific statement without some supporting information.” 
 Improving record-keeping is especially valuable for deaths in custody, said Marie Lasater, the former Texas County coroner who investigated the deaths of both Lancaster and Guest. When a death occurs behind prison walls, families rarely see or even speak with their loved one in their last moments, and don’t have immediate access to the basic information they otherwise would about how the person died. 
If a death was preventable, prisons may make it difficult for families to ever find out, Lasater noted. For this reason, she added, incarcerated people need more of an investigation than a death in the free world.
“There’s a lot more possibility for a prison death to be reported [as] something other than what it was,” she said. 
After Howard County Coroner Trisha Clark moved back to Missouri from Florida just before the pandemic, she said she was shocked by some of her peers’ practices. 
Rather than coroners, Florida’s system for death investigations relies on medical examiners, who are required by statute to keep duplicate copies of records, including autopsy reports and lab investigations. Florida also has a guide to record-keeping, and a commission whose job it is to ​​ensure “uniform standards of excellence.” In Missouri, no such guardrails exist. 
Clark also works as a forensic investigator for Boone County, home to the minimum security Fulton Reception and Diagnostic Center, where five people died last year. She said many of Missouri’s newer coroners understand the importance of investigating prison deaths thoroughly and independently, rather than simply rubber-stamping the prison’s version of events. 
Still, it’s a challenge to get coroners in every county on board without some minimum standard of record-keeping. 
“You have coroners that literally have a pocket notebook where they’re writing a name and a date of birth,” she said. “These families are not getting a full, thorough investigation because [the coroner] is just like, ‘Oh well, whatever.’” 
Nationally, legal and medical researchers, as well as forensic scientists, are pushing to reform the investigative system for deaths in custody. The goal, they say, is to improve public understanding of how deaths happen and reduce the number of preventable deaths. In a recent report, the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine recommended that states require licensing for anyone performing prison death investigations, as well as an annual peer review for all coroner and medical examiner’s offices of at least 10% of their cases. 
The report also recommended the federal government update its death certificate template to include a checkbox for deaths in custody.
Experts say there are several simple measures Missouri could take to improve the investigative process for people who die in prison, starting with clarifying expectations. State policy instructs coroners to investigate, but doesn’t say much about what that investigation should look like. Coroners can choose to talk to witnesses, or not, and there is no requirement for digitization of records. 
Ensuring transparency around prison deaths would require the state to create new standards, noted Aaron Littman, co-lead of UCLA Law’s Behind Bars Data Project. Those standards might stipulate how quickly prison death investigations must be completed, what data must be collected from the prison, and how much of it must be public or made available to families.
State legislators could standardize record-keeping by mandating all coroners and medical examiners use the same software and reporting systems, experts added. (The former head of Missouri’s Coroners and Medical Examiners Association told The Marshall Project – St. Louis he’s in the early stages of proposing a bill to do just that.) Policymakers could also require the public health system to update the state’s death certificate form with a clear designation for in-custody deaths, researchers noted, so the public isn’t reliant entirely on the criminal justice system to track and report deaths. 
Missouri’s Department of Mental Health has a fatality review panel tasked with assessing “all suspicious deaths” of adults in the department’s custody; researchers pointed out that the state could create a similar panel for prison deaths.  
To grieving families, a coroner’s ability to be a resource in the face of an opaque prison system can mean not only accountability for their loved one’s death, but also closure. Coroners noted that improving the standard of reporting would offer all families an equal chance to understand what happened, eliminating the speculation and uncertainty that can exacerbate their grief and suffering.  
For weeks after her husband’s death, Tanekka Guest clung to a fading hope that prison officials would provide any information about Christopher’s final moments. She said the only detail the warden shared — that Christopher died in his sleep — left her with more doubt and questions: Was he alone? What could have killed him so suddenly? When she heard a rumor from another incarcerated person about foul play in her husband’s death, she said it nearly broke her.
After going weeks without answers, Guest said the coroner gave her the information she needed to properly grieve. At last, she said, she could rest.
“I couldn’t believe it at first,” Guest said. “But that’s how I was finally able to get closer to him: knowing what happened.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/rVhJ3wAA-1024x538.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 09:56:14.320393

For many migrant and immigrant farmworkers in California who do not have legal status, mobile medical clinics are their only access to health care. But as President Donald Trump’s administration continues its crackdown on immigrants, vulnerable farmworker patients are delaying care out of fears of deportation.
As CalMatters’ Larry Valenzuela explains in a visual essay, immigrant farmworkers are often uninsured and suffer from high rates of hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol. The only health care providers this hard-to-reach population can access are often rural health teams that travel in pop-up medical clinics.
But since Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement activity, UC San Francisco has reported a 36% drop in the number of visitors to its mobile clinics. Without preventative care, however, people will inevitably get sicker — which costs more money and can overwhelm the health system, said Dr. Kenny Banh, UCSF mobile health clinic director.

Banh: “People don’t disappear because you changed policy. They still need care. What you’re doing is delaying care until the outcomes are worse, and there’s not much you can do but hospitalize the patient.”

Dr. Arianna Crediford, chief resident physician with Fresno St. Agnes Rural Mobile Health, said visits to its van have dropped by as much as 20% this year. 

Crediford: “The idea that people have to be scared to receive health care is heartbreaking. … We’re the last line of defense that they’re able to go to besides emergency rooms when they come in with an actual life-threatening event.”

This is just one of a handful of other examples of decreasing health access for California immigrants who are in the country without authorization. After Trump’s budget bill passed in July, California counties are bracing for health cuts that they say will make it harder for them to continue programs serving distinct populations, such as rural farmworkers. In the latest state budget, California lawmakers also froze new Medi-Cal enrollment for immigrants without legal status.

Anxiety, distrust among CA’s international students

Federal policy changes related to student visas have driven down the number of new international students enrolling in U.S. colleges — a change that could have a major effect on California, which has the most international students, report Aliza Imran and Kahani Malhotra of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network.
The Trump administration earlier this year revoked thousands of student visas. Though most visas were reinstated by April following lawsuits, the experience caused anxiety and distrust among some international students CalMatters spoke to. Stricter federal policies regarding who can live and work in the U.S. from abroad are also exacerbating concerns. 
The number of new international students enrolling in American colleges and universities in the 2025-26 academic year declined by 17%, according to the Institute of International Education. Over 1.1 million international students studied in the U.S. during the last academic year and of those students, over 140,000, or 12.5%, studied in California. 
Not only do foreign students help drive scientific research and advancement in the U.S. — they also bring in money for California’s public universities. Scenario modeling from the Association of International Educators showed that a projected 15% decline in international student enrollment this academic year in California could result in the state losing more than $1 billion in revenue from the tuition and living expenses foreign students must pay.

Young CA Dems eyeing Congress

The Democratic Party is facing intra-party clashes in California as younger challengers seek to unseat longtime Democratic incumbents in the U.S. House of Representatives, following significant election losses during last year’s presidential race, writes CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
A crop of young candidates in three of California’s deep blue districts are arguing that the Democratic party needs to offer voters candidates who have bold new ideas and can energize the party’s base — instead of aging incumbents entrenched in Washington’s insider culture.
In Sacramento, City Councilmember Mai Vang, 40, is running against 10-term Rep. Doris Matsui, 81. Vang told CalMatters that “status quo politics isn’t going to protect our communities,” and that she decided to run because “we need leaders who can meet the moment.”
But Matsui said she still has much more work to do in Congress, and that the relationships she’s built over 20 years in Washington are vital in helping her serve the public.

Matsui: “Once you’re in Congress, you have to learn how to govern, too. We cannot just throw everything out and start over again.”

En un caluroso día de verano, decenas de jornaleros hicieron una pausa en su trabajo de recolección de chiles en un campo remoto a 42 kilómetros de Fresno y acudieron a una clínica médica temporal. Era una oportunidad para recoger medicamentos y hacerse evaluaciones básicas de salud, como la presión arterial y el control de glucosa.
Durante casi una década, la Universidad de California en San Francisco (UCSF) ha estado desplegando clínicas móviles en el condado rural de Fresno para apoyar a una población de inmigrantes que de otro modo evitarían la atención médica.
 El programa cobró impulso durante la pandemia de COVID-19 y durante la década que California extendió la atención médica a los inmigrantes que se encuentran en el país sin autorización. Pero este año, los médicos están empezando a notar que los trabajadores no acuden a recibir atención como antes.
Los médicos creen que la disminución en la participación está relacionada con la agresiva aplicación de las leyes migratorias de la administración Trump. El Dr. Kenny Banh, director de la clínica móvil de salud de la UCSF, afirmó que las visitas de pacientes a sus unidades móviles rurales de salud comenzaron a disminuir a principios de año, cuando el presidente Donald Trump asumió su segundo mandato y prometió tomar medidas drásticas contra la inmigración ilegal.
“Hay mucha desconfianza. Vengo de la universidad y llevo una bata blanca; la gente está preocupada. Hacemos todo lo posible por explicarles cómo protegemos sus datos,” dijo Banh.

Según la UCSF, las visitas a sus clínicas móviles se redujeron en aproximadamente un 36% a medida que aumentaba las redadas migratorias en California. En 2024, las clínicas móviles atenderían un promedio de 34 pacientes por visita, pero en los últimos meses, la cantidad de pacientes se había reducido a aproximadamente 22. Las personas también están menos dispuestas a inscribirse en Medi-Cal , el programa estatal de seguro médico para hogares de bajos ingresos, por temor a compartir sus datos con el gobierno si no están autorizadas a permanecer en el país, explicó Banh.
Podría empeorar la situación.
California recortó la ley que permite a todos los residentes elegibles, independientemente de su estatus migratorio, recibir seguro médico a través de Medi-Cal al limitar temporalmente la inscripción el próximo año. Además, los condados se preparan para recortes a Medicaid bajo la ley presupuestaria que Trump firmó a principios de este año, la cual, según afirman, les dificultará mantener programas que atienden a poblaciones específicas, como el que brinda atención médica a los trabajadores agrícolas.
 “Va a ser más restrictivo en cuanto a requisitos laborales, reinscripciones más regulares y requisitos más estrictos para que los estados cumplan con los mandatos federales”, dijo Maria-Elena De Trinidad Young, profesora adjunta de salud pública en UC Merced. “Esto es una medida de presión. La política está diseñada para restringir el acceso a Medicaid, o como saben, en California lo llamamos Medi-Cal”.

 Llevando atención sanitaria a comunidades remotas
La clínica móvil que dirige Banh forma parte de una iniciativa más amplia del Departamento de Salud Pública de Fresno para reducir las enfermedades crónicas y transmisibles en las poblaciones que tienen dificultades al acceso médico. Recientemente, obtuvo financiación gracias a una ley de ayuda por la COVID-19 que el condado de Fresno destinó a las clínicas, dirigidas por la UCSF y el Centro Médico Saint Agnes.
 El dinero para el COVID-19 se está agotando, pero el programa tiene otro año de financiación asegurado.

Según Ivonne Der Torosian, vicepresidenta de salud y bienestar comunitario del Centro Médico Saint Agnes, el programa está diseñado para brindarles a los estudiantes de medicina la oportunidad de servir a la comunidad y ampliar acceso a la atención médica.
 “Tenemos un contrato explícito para ir al condado rural de Fresno y atender a los trabajadores agrícolas, asociarnos con los empleadores de esos trabajadores agrícolas y también brindar servicios a sus familias”.

Los trabajadores de salud comunitarios también brindan educación sanitaria y hacen recomendaciones a proveedores de atención primaria cercanos para personas que no pueden recibir tratamientos en los centros médicos. 
 “Realizamos evaluaciones básicas, incluyendo atención primaria y preventiva, para muchas de las familias a las que atendemos. Buscamos conectarlas con proveedores de atención primaria”, dijo Der Torosiran. “Les proporcionamos vacunas, les monitorizamos la glucosa y revisamos sus niveles de hipertensión y presión arterial. Son servicios básicos que recibirían en un centro de atención primaria”.

Dijo que la mayoría de los pacientes que atiende son trabajadores agrícolas e inmigrantes. Gran parte de la población rural no tiene acceso a la atención médica; el hospital más cercano está a 56 kilómetros. Algunos de sus pacientes acuden a la unidad médica para recibir atención primaria porque no saben adónde ir.
“Por eso vienen aquí. Les contamos lo esencial de lo que está pasando. Pero tenemos suministros limitados y lo que podemos verificar,” dijo.
 Lehga afirma que la cantidad de personas que acuden a la camioneta ha disminuido desde que se intensificaron las medidas de control migratorio. Ha escuchado a pacientes hablar con el personal durante la sesión de admisión sobre sus temores de acudir a la camioneta y buscar atención médica después de un verano de intensas redadas migratorias.

 “Nos dimos cuenta de que antes venían muchos más pacientes, pero se asustaron y no querían venir porque no sabían quién vendría”, dijo Lehga. “Antes se sentían cómodos porque sabían que era seguro. Ahora creo que los pacientes, en general, tienen más miedo de venir simplemente porque no saben quién puede venir”.
 La Dra. Arianna Crediford, médica residente principal de Fresno St. Agnes Rural Mobile Health, dijo que las visitas a la camioneta han disminuido entre un 15 y un 20% este año.
 “Podemos especular que se debe a los problemas con la inmigración en este momento, que parecen tener una gran influencia en los trabajadores agrícolas y el envasado de alimentos”, dijo.
Crediford dijo que ha escuchado a algunos pacientes mencionar la preocupación de buscar atención médica y lo que eso podría implicar para ellos, pero han dejado en claro que no recopilan información de inmigración y que no necesitan hablar con ellos sobre ese tema en absoluto.

“La idea de que las personas tengan que tener miedo de recibir atención médica es desgarradora. Realmente pondría en riesgo sus condiciones de salud, condiciones que requieren seguimiento semanal, a veces mensual. Somos la última línea de defensa a la que pueden acudir, además de las salas de emergencia, cuando llegan con un evento que pone en peligro su vida. El día que esta población no pueda buscar atención médica de forma cómoda y segura, su salud estará en peligro por ello”, dijo Crediford.
La población, que a menudo no cuenta con seguro médico, padece de altas tasas de hipertensión, diabetes o hiperglucemia y colesterol alto, a menudo sin tratamiento, afirmó Banh. Con frecuencia, el equipo de salud rural es el único profesional de la salud que atiende a los pacientes.

Banh afirmó que, al haber menos pacientes que acuden a atención preventiva, las personas se  enfermarán más y terminarán recibiendo atención médica de urgencias. Esto cuesta más dinero y amenaza con colapsar el sistema de salud.
 “La gente no desaparece porque se cambie la política. Siguen necesitando atención. Lo que se está haciendo es retrasar la atención hasta que los resultados sean peores, y no hay mucho que se pueda hacer salvo hospitalizar al paciente”, dijo.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/070125-Farmworker-Harvest-LV-37.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-01 09:56:14.320393

The number of new international students enrolling in college in the U.S. is dropping. Their losses will be felt beyond classrooms, as foreign students in particular drive scientific research and advancement. As the state with the most international students, California will likely feel the biggest impact.


Until this year, UCLA senior Syed Tamim Ahmad considered staying in the U.S. after graduation to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor. But when the Trump administration revoked thousands of student visas last spring, he spent many sleepless nights supporting his peers as his school’s international student representative. The experience left him exhausted.
Ultimately, most student visas were reinstated following pressure from courts and judges nationwide. But the speed and intensity of the revocations — coupled with a lack of institutional support — caused distrust and anxiety for international students like Ahmad.
“After all that fiasco, I decided no, not anymore,” said Ahmad, who was born in India and raised in the United Arab Emirates.
Ahmad, an integrated biology and physiological sciences major, is now planning to go to medical school in Australia, where he said he can do research “in peace” without fearing changes to his visa status or funding.
A recent report by the Institute of International Education shows that the number of international college students in the U.S. is mostly stable for now, with just a 1% decrease in enrollment this fall. However, the report also found a 17% decline in new international students enrolling in American colleges and universities. 
And from what students like Ahmad are saying, fewer are also likely to stay in the U.S. after graduation. 
Tightening federal policies about who can live and work in the U.S. from abroad threaten further decreases in enrollment and losses of talent. International students bring diverse viewpoints and perspectives that enrich the classroom environment and lead to scientific and economic advancements, researchers and faculty alike told CalMatters. 
The National Science Board found in a 2022 report that more temporary visa holders earn STEM doctorates than citizens and permanent residents combined, while international students earn a disproportionate amount of doctoral degrees in critical and emerging technologies. Foreign students in particular drive scientific research and advancement in the U.S.
Over 1.1 million international students studied in the U.S. during the last academic year. Of those students, 12.5% — over 140,000 — studied in California, making it the state with the largest international student population.
Last fall, international students made up 12% of the total student enrollment in the University of California system, with over 35,000 students from foreign countries. The California State University system enrolls nearly 14,000 international students, or about 3% of total enrollment.
This fall, the Cal State number has dropped to 12,122 students, according to the Cal State data dashboard. An official with the University of California Office of the President said the UC will not release enrollment data until later in December or January. 
The Institute of International Education collected responses from 828 U.S. higher education institutions for its report. While it is unclear how many of these were California institutions, the report states that 22% of responses were from western states.
The UC system has faced pressure from the California Legislature in recent years to increase the number of students from California. In response, the UC’s 2030 Capacity Plan proposed decreasing the amount of nonresident students. UC Regents also increased tuition for incoming nonresident students by over $3,400 starting this fall. 
Scenario modeling from the Association of International Educators showed California facing a projected 15% decline in overall international student enrollment this academic year. This would mean over 7,000 fewer international students for California’s two public university systems. The education nonprofit projects this drop could result in California losing more than $1 billion in revenue — based on the tuition and living expenses foreign students must pay — with similar enrollment trends across the country driving losses of nearly $7 billion nationwide.
Current realities for international students in California 
Dorothy, an undergraduate student from China and opinion columnist for The Daily Cal at UC Berkeley, said anxiety has increased among her peers under Trump’s presidency. She asked that her full name not be published due to fear of retaliation from the federal government.
Recently, her reporting on the international student experience in California has been bleak.
“A lot of students are just debating whether they should focus their future on their home country or continue to seek employment here” after graduating, she said.
She also said no amount of support from her university would be enough to make her feel fully secure from federal policy.
“If I get my visa revoked, I [won’t] be able to just come back and continue my education here, because [the decision] can be overruled by a larger government,” she said.
The total number of foreign students pursuing higher education in the U.S. under the F-1 visa, which classifies holders as nonimmigrant full-time students, had steadily increased since 2020, surpassing pre-COVID numbers in 2024. 
At the same time, the number of foreign students on temporary work authorizations, called Optional Practical Training, also increased. In the last academic year, nearly 300,000 foreign students were working with the authorization, a 21% increase from the prior year. Part of this accounted for graduate students entering the workforce. 
But graduate student numbers are also declining. This fall, graduate enrollment decreased by 12%, according to the Institute of International Education report, which may also be a response to Trump’s research funding cuts.

Sacramento State student Namrata, an international student from India who uses the singular name as her legal name, said her academic experience as a political science major has suffered due to her international student status.
She said faculty and peers have advised her to avoid writing about certain topics in her academic papers. Namrata referenced a recent English paper she wrote on freedom of speech, explaining that her professor cautioned her against making the piece overly political and discouraged her from addressing issues such as genocides or human rights violations. She said she feels restricted within her major and that her “degree doesn’t have value.”
“I don’t even have an equal chance to succeed as other students,” she said. “I wish I was them.”
Namrata is thinking about pursuing her master’s degree in another country or her home country.
Roma Singh, a freshman cinematic arts major from South Africa at Cal State Long Beach, said that while the immigration crackdown did “throw a wrench” in her plans, she ultimately decided that coming to California was the best decision for her aspirations. Singh hopes to pursue a career in Hollywood, and that being near Los Angeles will allow her to enter the industry.
Singh said that attaining her F-1 student visa was a difficult process. Embassy appointments were scarce, and she and her family scanned the embassy website for hours, several days in a row, to find an opening.
“I know some students who were hoping to attend Long Beach and they weren’t able to because they weren’t able to get an appointment,” Singh said.
International students are anxious about their futures 
Many international students come to the U.S. with the goal of staying permanently. But with the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants, several told CalMatters the U.S. is becoming a less desirable destination for education and residency.
The path for international students to stay in the U.S. after graduation isn’t easy. Through the temporary work authorization, F-1 visa holders can work in the U.S. for up to 12 months. The institute report shows that 92% of higher education institutions believe that without that work authorization, international students would likely choose other countries for their education.

Students may also pursue a work visa like the H-1B, which permits residency for an initial three-year period.
But a recent additional $100,000 fee for the H-1B visa — a common next step for international students wishing to stay in the U.S. after graduation — adds a roadblock for international students hoping to remain in the U.S. 
One major challenge for thousands of students, both current and prospective, has been navigating Trump’s June travel ban to and from 12 countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa. For seven more countries spread across the globe, he enacted a partial travel ban, including forbidding new student visas.
Students who already had visas were not subject to the ban, but many were advised by their universities to not leave the U.S., as re-entry was not guaranteed due to rapidly changing federal policy.
What international students bring to California
International students are a key source of revenue for tuition-driven universities, as they are not eligible for federal financial aid and often pay full tuition. 
With 50% of students at the UC and Cal State paying zero tuition due to financial aid, the higher tuition paid by international and out-of-state students is advantageous, said Valerie Lundy-Wagner, associate director of the Public Policy Institute of California’s higher education center.  
For the 2026-27 academic year, full-time nonresident students at the UCs will pay over $36,000 more in tuition than resident students. Assuming a normal credit load, nonresident students at Cal State will pay $14,000 more in tuition.
But while international students provide more tuition revenue than domestic ones, Lundy-Wagner said potential declines in enrollment are not dire, as institutions will have time to assess the intensity of enrollment declines and “what risk to tuition revenue they can expect,” allowing them to redistribute resources accordingly.
“No one expects that next year there are going to be no international students,” she said. 
For institutions in California, particularly graduate programs, Lundy-Wagner said the presidential administration’s recent slashing of federal research funding is “more of an immediate issue” than declines in international enrollment.
And if enrollment declines are significant enough, the UC and Cal State systems can always supplement losses in tuition revenue with out-of-state students, as “there are still plenty of other states they could be recruiting from” where students would pay the same nonresident tuition.
But international students bring much more to California than simply additional tuition revenue, Lundy-Wagner said.
“The state has a diverse economy. Diverse economies require people who have diverse perspectives, and some of that will come in through folks who are coming from different countries,” she said. “It benefits California students and faculty to be interacting with folks who are from these different places and spaces.” 
Sujatha Moni, a women’s and gender studies professor from India who teaches at Sacramento State, agrees. 
She said that international students bring a unique perspective from their cultural backgrounds and interact with class content differently, providing domestic students with new viewpoints that they otherwise wouldn’t have been exposed to. 
“International students enhance the value of education on our campus,” she said. “They bring that critical diversity that is much needed, that is so enriching, for any campus.”
Applying to study in California now
Despite the challenges, Dorothy said she has never regretted her decision to come to California for her university education, citing interesting classes, high-caliber professors and a vibrant, international community as draw factors. 
She said if international families can afford to send their students to the U.S., and if they “value the experience and the education itself, it’s still worth it” to study here. She is encouraging her brother to also study in the U.S.
At UCLA, Ahmad said he is wary about recommending international students study in the U.S., citing how draining it has been for him to constantly worry about his visa status and potential cuts to research funding on top of being a student. He told his brother to “absolutely not” apply to the U.S. for law school.
“Given the current situation, I would say no,” he said. “But if it was like, a year back, … I would say yes.”
Ahmad looks forward to finally being in Australia, away from “the political drama” in the U.S. and the pressure to constantly advocate for himself and his international peers.
“I can also take a step back and, you know, be a student.”

Fearful of sharing sensitive information, California farmworkers started staying away from mobile medical clinics after President Trump took office. “There’s a lot of distrust,” said a doctor in Fresno County. 


On a scorching summer day, dozens of farm laborers paused their work picking banana peppers in a remote field 26 miles from Fresno and filed into a pop-up medical clinic. It was a chance to pick up medication and take basic health assessments, such as blood pressure and glucose monitoring. 
For almost a decade, the University of California San Francisco has been fielding mobile clinics like this one in rural Fresno County to support a hard-to-reach population of unauthorized immigrants who otherwise would avoid routine health care. 
The program gathered steam through the COVID-19 pandemic and during California’s decade-long expansion of health care to immigrants who are in the country without authorization. But this year, doctors are starting to notice that laborers aren’t showing up for care like they used to. 
The doctors sense the decline in participation is connected to the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement activity. UCSF mobile health clinic director Dr. Kenny Banh said patient visits to his rural mobile health vans started dropping at the beginning of the year, when President Donald Trump took office for his second term, vowing to crack down on illegal immigration.
“There’s a lot of distrust. I come from the university, I have a white coat; people are worried. We do as much as we can to tell them how we protect their data,” Banh said.

According to UCSF, visits to their mobile clinics dropped by around 36% as enforcement activity increased in California. In 2024, the mobile clinics would see on average 34 patients per outing, but in the past few months, the number of patients had dropped to around 22 per outing. People are also less willing to sign up for Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance program for lower-income households, because they fear giving the government their data if they aren’t authorized to be in the country, Banh said.
It could get worse. 
California scaled back the law that allows all income-eligible residents regardless of immigration status to receive health insurance through Medi-Cal by temporarily limiting enrollment next year. And, counties are bracing for Medicaid cuts under the budget law Trump signed earlier this year that they say will make it harder for them to sustain programs serving distinct populations, like the one that brings health care to rural farmworkers.
“It’s going to be more restrictive in terms of work requirements, more regular re-enrollments, and more stringent requirements on states to comply with federal mandates,” Maria-Elena De Trinidad Young, an assistant professor of public health at UC Merced. “This is a push-out. The policy is really designed to restrict people from accessing Medicaid, or you know, in California, we call it Medi-Cal.”

Getting health care to remote communities
The mobile clinic Banh leads is part of a larger initiative from the Fresno Department of Public Health to reduce chronic and communicable diseases among hard-to-reach populations in the county. It gained funding most recently through a COVID-19 relief law that Fresno County steered to the clinics, which were led by UCSF and Saint Agnes Medical Center.
The COVID-19 money is running out, but the program has another year of funding locked in.

Clinics from both organizations can be found at community events, food distribution drives in rural communities, schools, and sometimes at farm working sites. The Saint Agnes mobile clinic van has two exam rooms inside for patients to receive care.

According to Ivonne Der Torosian, vice president of community health and well-being with Saint Agnes Medical Center, the program is designed to provide medical school students an opportunity to serve the community and create access to health care. 
“We are explicitly contracted to go out to rural Fresno County and serve agricultural workers, partner with employers of those farming workers, and also provide services to their families.”

Community health workers also provide health education and make referrals to nearby primary care providers for individuals who cannot be treated on-site. 
“We do basic screenings, including primary and preventive care, for many of the families we serve. We’re looking at connecting them to primary care providers,” Der Torosiran said. “We are providing vaccinations, we are providing glucose monitoring, and looking at their hypertension and blood pressure readings. So, really basic services they would get in a primary care setting.”

No nearby hospital
Dr. Navdeep Lehga, a resident physician, recently began a shift in the Saint Agnes medical van in Mendota’s Rojas Pierce Park. It’s an agricultural community just less than one hour west of Fresno. A line of people awaited her on the curb to pick up food from the distribution center and to see her and her team for a check-up.

As the morning progressed, Navdeep saw patient after patient in the mobile clinic’s exam room or went outside to see patients in the parking lot, checking blood pressure with a gauge strap on their patients’ arms and glucose levels with finger pricks.

She said most of the patients she sees are farm workers and immigrants. Much of the rural population doesn’t have easy access to medical care — the nearest hospital is 35 miles away. Some of her patients may seek out the medical van for primary care because they don’t know where else to go. 
 “That’s why they come here. We give them the gist of what’s going on. But we’re limited on our supplies and what we can check,” she said.
Lehga says the number of people coming to the van has slowed down since immigration enforcement has kicked up. She has heard patients speaking to staff during the intake session talk about their fears of coming to the van and seeking out health care after a summer of intensified immigration raids.

“We did notice there used to be a lot more patients coming before they have gotten scared and they don’t want to because they’re not sure who will show up,” Lehga said. “They did feel comfortable before coming here because they knew it was safe. Now I think patients are more scared to come in general just because they don’t know who can show up.”
Dr. Arianna Crediford, chief resident physician with Fresno St. Agnes Rural Mobile Health, said that visits to the van have dropped by 15 to 20% this year. 
“We can speculate that it’s because of the issues with immigration at this time, that seems to be a big influence with farmworkers and food packing,” she said.
Crediford said she’s heard some patients mention the worry about seeking care and what that might imply for them but they have made it clear that they don’t collect immigration information and that they don’t need to talk to them about it at all.

“The idea that people have to be scared to receive health care is heartbreaking. It would really put their health conditions at risk, conditions that require weekly sometimes monthly follow-up. We’re the last line of defense that they’re able to go to besides emergency rooms when they come in with an actual life-threatening event. The day this population can’t comfortably and safely seek care their health is going to be put in danger because of that,” said Crediford.
The population, which is often uninsured, suffers from high rates of hypertension, diabetes or high blood sugar, and high cholesterol, oftentimes without treatment, Banh said. Frequently, the rural health team is the only health care provider patients see.

With fewer patients showing up for preventive care, Banh said, people will inevitably get sicker and end up in the emergency room. That costs more money and threatens to overwhelm the health system.
“People don’t disappear because you changed policy. They still need care. What you’re doing is delaying care until the outcomes are worse, and there’s not much you can do but hospitalize the patient,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/070125-Farmworker-Harvest-LV-37.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-01 08:58:06.289754

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)The number of confirmed measles cases in Utah have surpassed 100, with state health officials reporting 102 as of Nov. 25, the last update available from the Thanksgiving holiday week. Of those, 24 were recorded in the last three weeks. 
Expecting the state and national measles surge to continue amid low vaccination rates, distrust and some isolating themselves from medical care, Utah health officials are bracing for the outbreak to get worse in coming months. 
“I think we actually have more to come before it gets better,” Utah State Epidemiologist Leisha Nolen told Utah News Dispatch on Wednesday.
The largest number of Utah’s confirmed cases are concentrated in Washington County in southwest Utah, where health officials have recorded 74 cases. But last week, the highly contagious virus started spreading in a high school further north, in Wasatch County, with at least eight students confirmed infected. 
That outbreak at Wasatch High School “really worries me,” Nolen said. 
“That is a new area to be infected. And it’s quite concerning that we suddenly saw so many people with this infection in one school,” she said. 











I think we actually have more to come before it gets better.


– Utah State Epidemiologist Leisha Nolen



Wasatch County has some of the lowest public school measles vaccination rates in the state, according to state data. 
“So we know that area is vulnerable to a continued spread of measles now that it’s introduced,” she said. “It’s one thing to have it localized in one school, but we know those kids go home, they have siblings at home, and they go do things that expose others. So I am worried that we’re going to have expansion from that in the immediate future.” 
The families involved in that outbreak are cooperating and isolating, Nolen said, but because measles is so contagious it’s likely to continue to spread because it took days to recognize the infections. “There were a few days nobody realized it was even measles, (and) they were probably going around while they were infectious,” she said.
Currently, Utah and Arizona are among the states in U.S. with the most recent outbreak cases of measles, according to The New York Times’ tracker. While case counts are slowing in Texas, that state so far has seen the largest outbreak with more than 800 cases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
First confirmed measles case in Salt Lake County points to community spread

Meanwhile, for the first time in more than 20 years, the U.S. at the end of the year is poised to lose its elimination status, a long-held designation indicating that outbreaks in the country had been rare and rapidly contained. 
As of Nov. 25, a total of 1,798 measles cases have been confirmed in the U.S. across 43 jurisdictions, according to federal health officials. Of those, 12% or 212 have been hospitalized, and three people have died from measles. 
In Utah, 11 people have been hospitalized from this year’s outbreak, according to the state’s measles dashboard. “Happily,” Nolen said, “they’ve all been fairly minor and been able to be discharged fairly rapidly.” And the state hasn’t confirmed any deaths from measles. 
But Nolen urged Utahns to still take the virus seriously — noting it’s especially dangerous for young children who are unvaccinated or too young to get vaccinated. 
Why does Utah and the U.S. have a measles problem? 
Many factors are fueling this year’s measles outbreak in and outside of Utah. Nolen said it’s a combination of low vaccination rates, vaccine skepticism in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and distrust in health institutions. 
“There’s a lot of misinformation and distrust fueling people’s behaviors and how they make choices, and that is making the outbreak worse,” she said. 
There are some similarities to vaccine skepticism stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Nolen noted the measles outbreak is “not at all like COVID” because an effective vaccine has existed for decades and the virus was largely stamped out before vaccination rates began dropping. 
Today, most people are vaccinated and protected, but as more parents choose not to vaccinate their children, that puts those kids and others who are immunocompromised at risk. 
“I certainly think there’s a lot of factors contributing to why people don’t get vaccinations. Part of it is they don’t know who to trust,” Nolen said. “Certainly these days there’s so many conflicting voices … I understand why they don’t know who to believe. The internet has allowed it so that many voices are very loud, and it’s hard if you aren’t familiar with science or how different systems work to know who to trust.” 
Measles outbreaks across Utah highlight risk to babies and pregnant women 

Cultural and religious factors have also influenced the spread of measles across the U.S. and in Utah. The outbreak in West Texas earlier this year spread mainly through a large Mennonite community, according to The New York Times. 
Utah’s largest hotspot in Washington County, near the Arizona border, has measles cases that can be traced to some areas with a history of polygamy, formerly under control of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a controversial sect that split from the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints long ago. 
Today, communities including the town of Hildale in Utah and Colorado City, Arizona — an area known as Short Creek — are becoming increasingly ex-FLDS, but vaccination rates are still lagging to effectively protect against measles, the Tucson Sentinel reported. 
Distrust of government and medical systems continue to be major drivers in communities with low vaccination rates, Nolen said. 
“One of the things we’re trying to do is increase communications with these communities so that we know what they are concerned about and so that we can work with them to help improve their health and make them understand what’s the best way they can do it for themselves,” Nolen said. 
Purposeful isolation away from government and health systems could also be resulting in underreported case counts. 
Last month, Salt Lake County health officials announced they had identified what was likely the county’s first case of measles — but at the time deemed it “probable” because the patient wasn’t fully cooperating, declining to be tested or participate in disease investigation. 
“It’s going to be different in different communities, but I think there are communities that have not just a distrust in government, but they have a distrust of medical systems. And so those people are going to be much less likely to come forward, and so we won’t be able to know how many people are sick in those areas,” Nolen said. 
Salt Lake County reports ‘probable’ 1st measles case, says patient isn’t cooperating

“Other parts of our state, they might not love the government, but they still are very accepting of health care,” she added, “and so they will go forward to their health care providers, and that will help us give a better idea of those areas.” 
As a result, Nolen said it’s likely Utah health officials will have a “slightly skewed understanding” of how prevalent measles actually is across the state. 
“We have heard from many community members that they know that there are individuals in their community who have symptoms — even the patients believe they have measles, but they don’t go in and get tested,” she said. 
“So we know there are a number of people who just stay home and suffer through this illness without getting any medical attention,” Nolen said. “We can’t count those people, so we don’t know how many exist, but we certainly hear from community members that that is happening.” 
Nolen said she worries for those people — and especially “kids who don’t have a choice, their parents have chosen whether or not to vaccinate.” 
“I’m concerned about them,” she said, in addition to the “people who unfortunately have gotten misinformation and therefore aren’t choosing to protect their families.” 
What to know about measles
Unvaccinated people — including children too young to be vaccinated — are more likely to experience severe complications from a measles infection. 
Symptoms usually start seven to 14 days after infection. They include fever, cough, runny nose, and red or watery eyes. Tiny white spots typically appear inside the mouth two to three days after symptoms begin. Three to five days after the first symptoms, a rash appears. The rash usually begins as flat, red spots at the hairline or on the face, which then spread down the body.
Many people infected with measles will experience mild symptoms, but about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people need to be hospitalized, according to health officials. Young children, pregnant women and people who have weakened immune systems are more likely to have serious problems from measles.  



Vaccine recommendations vary depending on age and vaccination history 

Children should receive two doses of measles vaccine: one dose at 12 to 15 months of age and another at 4 to 6 years. 
Typically, health officials haven’t recommended early measles vaccination for all infants due to low risk — but in Washington County specifically, state officials have recommended an early, extra dose for infants who live in the area or are expected to travel there due to the high number of reported cases.  
Adults born before 1957 generally do not need to be vaccinated because they are likely already immune to measles due to widespread infection and illness before the measles vaccine became available in 1963. 
Adults who were vaccinated before 1968 should have a second dose because the vaccine used from 1963 to1967 was less effective than the current vaccine, which became available in 1968. 
Adults who were vaccinated in 1968 or later are considered fully protected whether they have one or two doses, though certain higher risk groups (like college students, health care workers and international travelers) should have two doses.

To learn whether you or your child needs a dose of the measles vaccine, health officials urge Utahns to talk to their doctors or check their immunization records. Most Utahns’ records are available through the secure Docket app or website.

Ontario Tillman, D-Bessemer, watches proceedings in the Alabama House of Representatives on May 6, 2025 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama lawmaker has filed a bill that would allow local boards of education to pay their employees on a semi-monthly basis.
HB 62 sponsored by Ontario Tillman, D-Bessemer, would make local school boards pay employees on the first and and 16th of each month with exceptions for weekends, holidays and the first day of October, the start of the budget year. Currently, teachers are paid once a month.
“There is a need to kind of change how we do things when it comes to education. And I want to look at a different way forward,” Tillman said in a phone interview Tuesday. “I think that if we can start with changing the teacher pay from once a month to semi-monthly, we can provide different incentives for our teachers and make Alabama an attractive state to come and teach as well as allow us to retain our teachers here as well.”

Tillman, who was a special education teacher for 10 years, said he has heard several complaints from teachers about how often they’re paid.
“I understand exactly the complaints from a number of teachers as well as other school board employees. So it would affect the full scope of education. It would change the pay for every educator and staff personnel within the school system,” he said.
The bill would allow local boards to opt out of paying teachers on a semi-monthly basis within 60 days of the bill’s passage.
Tillman first filed the bill during the 2025 legislative session. He said he’s willing to advocate for having teacher pay more often despite pushback.
“This is a fight I’m willing to have, and I want to continue to have some movement on it,” Tillman said. “We’re receiving tons of pushback from this bill and it’s mainly coming from these schools’ CFOs and some school superintendents.”
Tillman also said states surrounding Alabama such as Georgia and Tennessee as well as some parts of Florida and Mississippi pay their teachers twice a month.
In 2022, Mississippi passed a law that allowed semi-monthly pay for teachers. As of July, only four counties in the state utilize the law.

Pictured are paddlers on the Ocmulgee River in Butts County. Georgia Rivers/Joe CookA massive data center project backed by Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and his family could be coming to Butts County, but many of the project’s details are still unknown.
Jones, a Republican, is running to be Georgia’s next governor.
The Highway 16 Interstate Health Development near Interstate 75 owned by Jones’ father is set to include a 450,000 square-foot hospital, 1.2 million square feet of medical office space and 11 million square feet of data centers – making it one of the biggest data centers currently planned in Georgia and placing it among the largest ever built by today’s standard.

The estimated $10 billion project is expected to go through more than 4.5 million gallons of water per day, more than tripling Butts County’s current water usage, and generate nearly $92 million per year in annual tax revenues when it is completed by 2040.
That’s just about all the information publicly available on the project, and those details come from a two-page development of regional impact filing that was submitted to the Georgia Department of Community Affairs.
The lack of information is a problem for environmental advocates like Fletcher Sams, executive director of the Altamaha Riverkeeper.
“Here’s what I don’t know: I don’t know how many megawatts it is. I also don’t know the cooling technology that they will use to cool the chips,” he said. “Those things are very important for me to know because the concern that I have for the location of it is that it’s in the upper Ocmulgee basin, and I’ve got 24 other data centers projected to come into that basin. The issue that I have with that basin is that between now and 2060, that region is going to see approximately 740,000 new residents.”
Decision-making on data centers left to local officials
The Georgia Department of Community Affairs recently approved new rules to bring large-scale data center developments under official state review, but critics say the rules fail to fully account for the cumulative burden the facilities have on the state’s energy and water supplies.
The amendments to its “developments of regional impact” process, for the first time, explicitly list “technological facilities (including data centers).” This comes after a self-imposed pause in processing regional impact reviews for data centers that was meant to give the department time to clarify the rules, DCA Commissioner Christopher Nunn said during a legislative subcommittee meeting in August. Some local governments began applying previous rules for impact reviews not intended for data centers since the projects did not fit under any of the previously specified development types, leading to a lack of consistency across the state.

While other proposals for data centers moved forward without a state review during the months-long pause, the Butts County development includes a hospital and commercial areas, which was enough to trigger a regional review.
Yet, the main issue, according to environmental advocates and community organizers, is the limitations of the process itself: The state’s impact review process is designed to be a communication tool, not a regulatory one.
“This simply ensures that neighbors are talking to neighbors, that cities are talking to counties, that other stakeholders are engaged in a process,” Nunn said to the legislative subcommittee at the time, stressing that his state agency serves merely as a “repository” for data, and the final regional impact report is purely advisory. The local government “maintains the authority to make the final decision on whether a proposed development will or will not go forward.”
The reliance on local government autonomy and information sharing leaves the state’s natural resources vulnerable to depletion, environmental advocates say.
But for Butts County, proponents of the mega project say the tax revenue would allow the county to advance and compete with neighboring metro areas. Residents often have to travel out of the county for many amenities, which is “not conducive to a good community,” said county manager Brad Johnson. He said that the development – called River Park – would diversify the county’s tax base, which currently largely comes from residents.
“We’re looking forward for some commercial or industrial tax generation to help take the burden off of our citizens, so I think not just Butts County, I think the entire region will benefit by the proposed project,” Johnson said.
Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, a national association for the data center industry, said in a letter submitted during the public comment period on the revised regional review process that any new rules should consider the economic benefits data centers may bring. Attempts to reach the coalition for a comment for this story were unsuccessful.
“These tax revenues support investments in community priorities like education, transportation, and public safety that help enhance the quality of life for Georgians,” Diorio said.
Butts County’s planning commission is set to hear the developer’s application to rezone the property to mixed-use development in December, Johnson said, and the county commission can consider the application beginning in January, starting with a public hearing. Once rezoned, developers can begin construction.
Concerns about water usage
If you’ve ever sat down to watch a movie with your laptop on your lap and felt your legs start to become uncomfortable from the warmth, you know that computer components heat up when they’re doing their jobs. Data centers contain a lot more hardware than your laptop and perform complex calculations, generating massive temperature increases.
Keeping everything cool enough to function requires a lot of water – hundreds of thousands or millions of gallons per day – and Sams said it’s just not clear whether Georgia’s rivers can provide for all the planned data centers plus population growth and the power needs that come with that.
“Of the 25 data centers that I am tracking in the Ocmulgee, only nine have DRI information available,” Sams said, referring to the state impact review. “Of those nine, they’re going to withdraw close to 10 million gallons on top of the other withdrawals.”
Sams said Georgia has seen concerns over water usage surrounding large projects in recent years, pointing to the Bryan County Hyundai plant that has sparked concerns over water use.
“I’m worried about us over issuing withdrawal permits in the Ocmulgee basin for these data centers and for the power generation for the data centers when there is no backup,” Sams said.
For years, Georgia allowed the data center boom to expand without clear, statewide metrics, leading to what advocates call a “data vacuum,” a term Kristen Stampfer, director of Coastal Communities United, a nonprofit working to preserve rural communities, used in a letter submitted to DCA during a recent public comment period.
“These projects, collectively, represent an immense and largely unaccounted-for draw on Georgia’s finite resources … The proposed Project Sail in Coweta County alone demonstrates the scale of the challenge: its daily water use could reach 9 million gallons and its energy demand of 900 MW rivals that of a small city, yet it falls outside a rigorous review,” Stampfer said.
‘It’s not sustainable’
It’s not just water that has advocates concerned about the spike in data centers. All that new digital number crunching needs a lot of electricity – Georgia Power has claimed that data centers will consume about 80% of the new power generated in Georgia through 2031.
But like the water draw numbers, projecting exactly how much of Georgia’s juice will be squeezed out by data centers is a tough job, says Amy Sharma, executive director of Science for Georgia, a science advocacy nonprofit.
“If all the planned ones that we have found – which by the way all of these numbers are estimates based on publicly available information like newspaper articles and like DRI reports and stuff like that. So who knows? We’re not getting exact numbers from the data center developers themselves – there’s about 40 plans for the state that would take up 14 gigawatts,” Sharma said.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, 14 gigawatts is enough energy to power 1.4 billion LED lightbulbs.
“It’s just bonkers,” Sharma said. “There’s no other word for this besides bananas, right? Like it’s just off the rails. It’s not sustainable.”
Utility rates have been rising in Georgia and were a major issue for Democrats, who flipped two seats currently held by Republicans on the five-seat Georgia Public Service Commission running on energy affordability. The two incumbents had voted to approve six rate increases over the last two years, resulting in an estimated average annual increase of about $500 for the average household.
The politics
The Butts County property has been at the center of a political battle over hospital regulations and alleged self-dealing in the past.
Jones came under criticism in 2023 for a push to rewrite rules for new hospitals in a way critics said was catered to allow for a hospital to be built on property owned by Jones’ father.
That effort fell short, but Gov. Brian Kemp signed a bill easing those hospital regulations last year.
Jones’ push toward loosening those restrictions has already become campaign fodder in the Republican gubernatorial primary.

Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, who is also jockeying to be the Republican candidate for governor next year, accused Jones of using his office to line his family’s pockets.
“If you honor me by allowing me to be your next Governor, unlike the Lt. Governor, I will promise you this: I will not change the rules or rig the system to enrich myself or my family on your backs or the backs of our fellow Georgians,” Carr said on social media in October.
A billboard standing over the Butts County site reads “Burt Jones’ $10 billion family project, Rewritten laws. Family profits. That’s Burt Jones’ family payday.”
The billboard was paid for by Keep Georgia Strong Action Inc., an independent campaign group that supports Carr.
Jones’ spokesperson Kayla Lott dismissed the issue.
“This is a simple rezoning application by a private company,” she said. “It’s a nonstory.”
“As for Chris Carr, he’s not a serious candidate. He’s grasping at straws because he’s stuck in a distant third place, his fundraising has collapsed, and the only people paying attention to him at this point are the ones on his payroll,” she added.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)For the first time in Nevada, a bipartisan supermajority of state lawmakers petitioned to add their own topic to an ongoing special session called by the governor. The issue seen as important enough to cross the aisle over: corporate home ownership.
The bill that emerged from that effort ultimately fell one vote shy in the state Assembly, but its defeat came with promises from Democrats and Republicans alike to continue working on proposed legislation with the goal of reintroducing a bill in the next regular legislative session in 2027.
“People are being priced out of homes,” Democratic Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro told reporters after the special session adjourned. “You can talk to almost anyone and find an anecdotal story of someone who was competing against a corporation with unlimited coffers in order to buy a home… We owe it to Nevadans to work on solutions to home ownership and to affordability issues, and that was absolutely something that we should have passed.”
Assembly Minority Leader Greg Hafen (R-Pahrump), before voting against the bill in his chamber, called the issue “something that is worthy of this body to look at.”
“I just don’t believe this legislation is there yet,” he continued.
Senate Bill 10 of the 36th Special Session was designed to stop corporations from gobbling up a critical mass of  available properties, giving Nevadans a better shot at the American dream of homeownership.
It would have placed a 1,000-unit cap on the total aggregate number of homes that could be purchased in a year by private investors. The Nevada Secretary of State’s Office would help monitor a new corporate homeowner registry and determine when the 1,000-unit limit was reached.
The legislation was presented by state Sens. Dina Neal, a Democrat from North Las Vegas, and Ira Hansen, a Republican from Sparks.
Neal brought similar legislation in 2023. The bill, supported by Hansen, was vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo.
That year, a Stateline analysis of data from real estate analytics firm CoreLogic found that nearly a quarter of all single-family homes sold in 2021 had been purchased by investors. In Nevada, the same analysis found, the share of investor purchases increased from 18% to 30% from 2020 to 2021.
Neal revived her corporate home ownership legislation in the 2025 regular session, though she made the cap a paltry 100 housing units after reading in the Las Vegas Review Journal that one corporate investor had purchased 264 homes in a single day. Hansen said during the floor vote in May that he had “been asked by the executive branch to support a caucus ‘no’ position” and would “very reluctantly” vote in opposition.
The Lied Center for Real Estate at the University of Nevada Las Vegas estimated investors owned roughly 15% of homes in the City of Las Vegas. That percentage was expected to grow both in Nevada and across the nation.
The bill under consideration by lawmakers in the special session set the aggregate cap at 1,000. Industry groups pushed behind the scenes for a 2,000 limit, but those requests were dismissed by Hansen and Neal. 
New builds, manufactured homes, apartments, condominiums, townhomes, and foreclosures bought by credit unions would have been excluded from the cap.
Jonathan Norman with the Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers urged lawmakers to reconsider the exclusion of town homes and condos since they are often seen as “the first step of the property ladder.”
“If you have young people who cannot afford a home, or the average price is $400,000, a condo is a good way to start building equity,” he said. “I’m afraid if we start exempting those, the eye of corporate buyers and private equity might be swift to condos and town homes and freeze out those people who might not have a down payment.”
Hansen said the exclusion for new builds addressed the “political reality” of potential opposition from industry groups. 
“Southern Nevada Home Builders didn’t want to be included in the bill and they would have aggressively opposed it,” he said.
The association still opposed the bill.
David Goldwater, a lobbyist with the Nevada Home Builders Association, warned the bill could still have “unintended consequences.”
Other opponents raised concerns about the constitutionality of the bill, specifically the “dormant commerce clause,” by which states can’t enact measures that interfere with interstate commerce.
 ‘Political reality’ 
“I have so much respect for this institution,” said an audibly shaken Assemblymember Alexis Hansen (R-Sparks) before casting what was seen as the deciding ‘no’ vote that killed the corporate home ownership bill, “but I don’t have a respect for what has transpired in the last few days, but particularly in just the last couple of hours.”
Hansen went on to say that her signing of the petition to have the bill considered during the special session was not a commitment to vote for it on the floor. (She voted against the 2023 version of the bill. The 2025 regular session version of the bill never made it to the Assembly, meaning she did not have a chance to vote on it.)
“I just wanted us to be able to bring the bill and hear it, find those solutions that we needed to,” she continued.
Hansen said she would “work diligently” in the upcoming months.
The assemblymember could not be reached by the Nevada Current for additional comment.
The effort to rein in the purchasing power of corporations was not on the list of items for the special agenda. Alexis Hansen and her husband, state Sen, Ira Hansen (R-Sparks), worked with the Democratic caucuses on a petition to force the issue to be added to the special session.
The bill was brought forward as intense negotiations around the film tax credit were happening behind closed doors. Neal attempted to shoot down rumors that her bill’s resurrection was brought “so I can feel comfortable to vote on film.”
“I am not horse trading for corporate investors for a vote on film,” Neal said.
(Neal would, later that day, vote for the film studio bill, but she would say in a floor statement and to reporters afterward that her vote was cast out of personal loyalty to Senate Majority Leader Cannizzaro, who Neal credited with saving her life earlier this year after a medical episode.)
Ira Hansen also pushed back on rumors he was being “offered some sort of deal” in exchange for support of the film tax credit bill.
“Everybody knows I’m a no” on the film bill, he said, “and that’s not going to change.” 
Hansen would go on to vote against the film studio bill.
The corporate housing bill received attention and support from Democratic lawmakers throughout the state, including U.S. Rep. Dina Titus, who called in to support; U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford, who wrote a letter in support; and Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, who participated in the hearing.
Ford, who is running for governor, used much of his time to attack Lombardo for killing previous iterations of the bill.
When given the opportunity to “limit out-of-state corporations from buying our homes and pricing Nevadans out of their communities, he failed to do so,” Ford said. “Because of his dereliction of duty Nevada families are suffering and Wall Street hedge funds are the largest landlords in Clark County having amassed thousands of homes.”

(Photo: Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images)New York’s mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, campaigned on a promise to raise the city’s income tax on its richest residents from 3.9% to 5.9%. Combined with the state income tax, which is 10.9% for the top bracket, the increase would cement the city’s position as having the highest taxes on top earners in the country.
It set off a chorus of warnings about the tax flight of the city’s wealthiest residents.
Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman claimed that both the city’s businesses and wealthy residents “have already started making arrangements for the exits.”
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul echoed the concern, opposing the proposal “because we cannot have them leave the state.” Before the election, Mamdani’s opponent, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo, joked that if Mamdani won, “even I will move to Florida.”
I research whether high earners actually move when their taxes go up. My colleagues and I have analyzed millionaire taxes in New Jersey and California, the migration of Forbes billionaires globally and decades of IRS data tracing where Americans with million-dollar incomes live.
Top earners are often thought of as “mobile millionaires” who are ever searching for lower-tax places to live. In reality, they’re often reluctant to leave the places where they built their careers and raised their families.
At the same time, there are grains of truth in the tax migration arguments, so it’s important to carefully parse the evidence.
 A small fraction of a small fraction

The first fact is simple: Millionaires have low migration rates.
Mobility in America is highest among people who are still searching for their economic place in life. Workers who earn the lowest wages move across state lines at relatively high rates, about 4.5% per year, often in search of more affordable housing. People making $1 million-plus a year move only half as often: Just 2.4% of them pack up each year.
When millionaires do move, it rarely appears to be for tax reasons. For example, Florida is the top destination for New York movers in general. But among the richest 1% of New Yorkers, the top destination is Connecticut, followed by New Jersey and California, all three of which levy a millionaire tax.
Some millionaires certainly do favor lower-tax destinations. But many moves to low-tax states are offset by moves in the opposite direction to higher-tax states, and many other moves take place between states that have the same tax rate.
Overall, only about 15% of millionaires who move end up with a lower tax bill. That shows the rich are willing and able to move for tax reasons. But because only about 2.4% of millionaires move each year – and only a fraction of those moves reduce their taxes – overall tax migration ends up being a small fraction of a small fraction. Not never, but not often.
 Some benefits don’t have a dollar sign

Migration is mostly a young person’s game.
The most mobile Americans are recent college graduates who are brimming with potential, searching for work and unburdened by major responsibilities. Their rate of migration from one state to another is over 12%, more than four times the rate of millionaires.
The typical adult mover is about 30 years old, while the highest income earners are typically about 50. People choose where to build their careers and families decades before they reach their peak earnings phase.
By the time someone earns enough to be taxed in the highest brackets, they’re usually late into their careers. They are almost always married, often have children at home, own their homes and, in many cases, own a business. Their social lives and their economic success are linked to local networks of colleagues, clients and connections built up over a long career. Moving away from those networks means giving up a great deal of social capital and starting over somewhere new.
Top earners know that some states have lower taxes, but for most, tax flight is simply a bad deal. The social and economic costs of uprooting are bigger than the tax savings.
 When your social world collapses

Two recent events showed why the rich generally stay where they are – and what it takes to move them.
The first was the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in late 2017. The tax reform package capped the federal deduction for state and local taxes and raised taxes on high earners in states like New York, New Jersey and California. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled “So Long, California. Sayonara, New York,” economists Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore predicted that 800,000 people a year would flee those states.
They didn’t. A colleague and I studied every millionaire tax return in the country for two years before and after the reform. Nothing happened. There was no increase in migration out of the states where tax burdens rose. The predicted exodus simply did not occur.
We were about to wrap up the study and call it case closed. Then something unexpected did happen: In early 2020, millionaires began leaving high-tax states in large numbers. Low-tax states saw no comparable outflows. The pattern matched those tax-flight predictions from just a few years earlier.
It was the COVID-19 pandemic, and it brought a profound shock to the social lives of city residents.
Offices emptied out, with entry swipes in major cities dropping by nearly 90%. Time spent at work fell sharply, local amenities were shuttered, and time spent alone grew as in-person contact became a health risk. K–12 schools closed, disrupting children’s relationships with teachers and classmates.
For many households, this was also a strange form of freedom, and a chance to rethink the geography of work and life, especially for top earners who could work remotely from anywhere. Disconnected from the bonds of place, top earners moved and clearly favored low-tax destinations.
The lesson is that social lives and economic policies are deeply intertwined. The 2017 tax reform had no effect on migration because the social cost of moving is high – especially for people at the peak of their careers who are enjoying the many social benefits of economic success. As long as those connections to others are strong, they outweigh the appeal of moving to lower-tax states.
When the pandemic broke apart so much of social life, the ledger shifted. If your office, school, friendships and daily routines no longer anchor you in place, what is keeping you in a high-tax place?
But by early 2023, as social and economic life returned to normal, we found that millionaire migration patterns mostly reverted to their prepandemic baselines.
In other words, the surge in tax flight was temporary.
 If you want the rich, appeal to the young

There is a big lesson here for state and city policies.
Every place wants to attract high-income earners and the spending power and tax dollars that accompany their salaries. Many policymakers think that tax cuts will lure them in, but this is mostly a fool’s errand. In normal times, the rich are deeply rooted and not movable.
The real opportunity lies in attracting and retaining the next generation of top earners – young people who are unattached to place and looking for opportunities to build their careers and their lives. Places that draw young professionals build the pipeline of future top earners.
Those early-career folks are mobile, but they are not thinking about the top tax rate. Their salaries are low. They are trying to find good jobs, pay the rent, form relationships and start families. They hope to be successful enough to one day be paying Mamdani’s millionaire tax. For the time being, though, they need the basic costs of living to be manageable. Soon they will need affordable child care and good public schools for their kids.
If the city helps them that far along, many of them would gladly pay a millionaire tax when and if the time comes. In this light, the Mamdani plan is simply practical: Higher taxes at the top support the services and quality of life that keep the next generation in the city.

(Andi Rice for Alabama Reflector)A Doug Jones gubernatorial campaign was always going to be a “yes, but” proposition.
Can Jones do the job? Yes. Absolutely. But competence is no guarantee of victory.
Can Jones become his party’s nominee? Yes. Almost certainly. But there are two other Democrats in the race — Will Boyd and Chad ‘Chig’ Martin — and Jones will first have to lock down his base. All three candidates should be mindful of Republicans crossing over for chaos purposes, especially if the GOP contest is noncompetitive.

Can Jones raise money? Yes. He pulled in $25.7 million in his 2017 U.S. Senate race and $31 million for his reelection bid in 2020. But in 2017, he faced former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, who had long struggled to raise money. And unlike 2020, Jones is not the sitting U.S. senator in this race. That’s likely GOP nominee Tommy Tuberville, who has already raised $8.1 million for the campaign.
Can Jones win?
Yes.
The former senator is a formidable campaigner. Sure, he got dealt a good hand in the 2017 campaign. Moore’s nomination divided the GOP, even before the former chief justice faced multiple allegations of sexual assault and misconduct.
Still, good cards are worthless if you don’t play them right. Jones was a model of campaign discipline, laughing off repeated Republican efforts to bait him. In the white hot national spotlight that fell on Alabama that year, there wasn’t a single serious misstep or mishap from the Jones campaign.
Next year’s environment might also benefit Jones. The economy seems shaky. Republicans appear indifferent to rising health care costs. President Donald Trump’s net favorability rating in Alabama, per the Economist/YouGov poll, was 4.9% as of last week – not  a particularly great mark in a state he won by 30 points last year.
And Democrats will almost certainly vote for Jones with more enthusiasm than Republicans will for Tuberville. Particularly if Tuberville’s campaign continues issuing comically arrogant statements like this one, treating his election as a foregone conclusion
But.
There are more Republicans in Alabama who will vote for Tuberville with stone faces than there are Democrats who will cast their ballots with a smile. Straight-ticket voting means that candidate quality and even charisma are irrelevant. In 2022, straight-ticket ballots accounted for two-thirds of all the votes cast in Alabama. Straight-ticket Republican ballots were 44% of all votes cast.
In 2020, Jones outraised Tuberville three-to-one and was far more visible and public than his opponent, who said nothing about his plans and largely limited his interviews to conservative lickspittles. He still won.
It won’t be a surprise if Tuberville repeats that turtle strategy in a general election battle with Jones. It worked before. So long as he has that R next to his name, Tuberville is the favorite.  Even if he wears a Florida Gators jersey all year.
And that’s before we get to Alabama demographics. In general, we are older, more rural and less educated than the country as a whole. Not trends that favor Democrats.
So yes, it’s probable, even likely, that Jones falls short next November.
But Jones has done a critical service for Democrats.
First, his presence almost certainly means the party will avoid repeating the disaster of 2022.
Underfunding and internecine squabbles have undermined Alabama Democrats’ recruitment efforts for years. But the party somehow managed to find a space below that ground-level bar in 2022. The party’s slate of statewide candidates that year consisted of amateurs and novices. None could raise money. All got blown out.
That almost wrecked downballot Democrats. Amid abysmal turnout, several Black legislators in safe blue seats found themselves in contests that shouldn’t have been close. Rep. Thomas Jackson, D-Thomasville, who represents a district that is about 60% Black, barely squeaked by a Republican opponent.
Provided Jones can raise money and wage a statewide campaign, Democrats should hold what they have. Depending on how the U.S. Supreme Court rules in a critical redistricting case out of Louisiana, Jones’ campaign could also be critical for the fortunes of U.S. Rep. Shomari Figures, D-Mobile, a likely target of future Republican redistricting efforts.
And while straight-ticket voting could doom Jones statewide, it could be a benefit in a few marginal legislative seats, particularly those in Huntsville. Probably not enough to end the GOP supermajority, but enough to cut it and bring new faces and energy to Goat Hill.
The party should be working from now through qualifying in early January to find as many viable candidates to stand in as many legislative districts as possible. A Jones campaign will help local candidates with statewide exposure and fundraising. A large field of local candidates can keep voters engaged and enthusiastic for Jones.
Win or lose, Jones has given Democrats a rare opportunity for growth next year. Yes, Alabama will be a red state for the foreseeable future. But the former senator gives the party a chance to add some purple hues.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ALR_NoKings_BHM_101825-19-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-12-01 08:58:06.289754

(Photo: Anna Liz Nichols)Top lawyers for Consumers Energy and DTE Energy have donated to a Michigan attorney general candidate’s primary race, raising conflict of interest questions about whether the utilities are trying to influence a prosecutor who may handle their legal and regulatory cases. 
The candidate, current Democratic Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald, would stand opposite the utilities’ attorneys in the courtroom or in regulatory battles, should she win. 
The next attorney general will be tasked with representing residential customers in especially high stakes legal and regulatory battles over controversial data center plans, and the cases’ outcomes will for decades impact the climate, how much residents pay for energy, and utilities’ bottom lines. 
The current term-limited attorney general, Dana Nessel, has been viewed as a national leader in protecting consumers and taking on utilities. The utilities likely want to avoid a repeat of Nessel’s tenure, industry observers say, and the donations highlight an avenue in which they can influence the state’s potential next top cop. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The donations represent “a very serious conflict of interest,” said Craig Holman, a lobbyist with Public Citizen, a Washington D.C. campaign finance watchdog. 
“When you get a special interest giving money to candidates, and they’ve got something pending before that office, then they are trying to curry favor by making campaign contributions,” Holman added. 
McDonald did not respond to Michigan Advance’s requests for comment. 
A review of the most recent state campaign finance filings shows executive level attorneys from DTE and Consumers each gave $1,000 to McDonald. That includes DTE’s senior vice president and chief legal officer, Katherine Lorenz, and Kelly Hall, deputy legal counsel for Consumers. A donation of $100 was made by Andrea Hayden, a lower level DTE Energy legal department employee. And a $250 donation was made by Consumers Energy lobbyist Hillary Kipp. 
The donation sizes are significant for a state level attorney general primary. While the state’s utilities are prolific campaign donors, it is unusual for their attorneys to make multiple donations to a prosecutor’s primary campaign. 
In a statement, a DTE spokesperson said, “It’s not appropriate for us to comment on individual employees’ personal contributions.” 
A Consumers spokesperson said, “Any individual political contribution made by a company employee is done in his or her personal capacity – and not on behalf of CMS Energy.”
Requests to speak with the individuals were ignored or denied.

McDonald has so far reported raising $840,000, more than the other four candidates combined. Records show she also has far more support from the state’s largest corporations than her opponents. Delegates will select the nomination for each party’s candidates at their respective April conventions. 
Among McDonald’s top competitors in the race is Washtenaw County Prosecutor Eli Savit, who, in a statement to the Advance, sought to draw a difference between he and McDonald on corporate donations, which he said he is not taking. 
He also noted he signed the League of Conservation Voters’ No Utility Money challenge, under which campaigns will not knowingly accept contributions from utility PACs, executives or lobbyists. 
Savit said rejecting utility money is especially “crucial” for an attorney general candidate. 
“The AG is the one position in Michigan charged with protecting consumers, workers, and our natural resources – frequently against powerful corporate interests on the other side,” he said.

Meanwhile, Mark Totten, a third Democratic candidate, has received $1,100 from a Consumers Energy executive, but records do not show a donation from either utilities’ legal counsel. 
The revelations come amid a state ballot initiative effort that would prohibit regulated utilities and their executives from making political donations. If approved, the type of donations made by the executive level attorneys to McDonald would be banned.
Karlee Weinmann, a researcher for the utility industry watchdog Energy and Policy Institute, questioned McDonald’s decision not to respond to questions about the utility donations in the context of the ballot initiative effort.  
“To sort of sidestep questions about who is funding a campaign runs counter to this strong public call for greater transparency across the board in Michigan,” Weinmann said. 
Why utilities are so interested in the race
Weinmann said Nessel has been “fiercely advocating” for residential ratepayers, and effectively communicating with the public about the arcane regulatory process, which has helped raise public awareness about utility issues.
The attorney general has regularly intervened over the last seven years in regulatory proceedings at which the cost structures for residents’ DTE and Consumers bills are determined. These interventions have saved ratepayers billions of dollars at the expense of DTE and Consumers’ bottom lines. 
Weinmann pointed to an anecdote she said is emblematic of the important role the attorney general’s office plays in utility affordability, and may explain utilities’ interest in the current primary.  
In a May 2024 rate case in which DTE sought a $266 million increase in customers’ costs, the company tried to pass on expenses for executives’ private jet travel. Nessel successfully blocked the proposal. 
Nessel calls for reduction of proposed DTE electric rate increase

In a press release at the time, Nessel wrote, “When the shady details crammed into these filings emerge into the daylight, a lot of the proposed spending is questionable at best, and at times downright insulting to customers.”
Nessel argued DTE should only be able to increase customer costs by $111m – about $155m below DTE’s request. Regulators granted a $113 million increase, which observers deemed a clear loss for DTE. 
Weinmann said Nessel has “set a national standard for how attorneys general can and should be operating with regard to monopoly utilities and their attempts to pass inappropriate expenses on to ratepayers.” 
“Certainly the utilities in Michigan have experienced the consequences of an attorney general who is unwilling to back down and unafraid to step to them,” Weinmann added. 
Legal and regulatory battles 
The next attorney general will handle highly consequential regulatory and legal battles over controversial data centers proposed for Michigan.
The centers are already causing energy rate spikes across the country, and consumer advocates fear the same is poised to happen in Michigan, unless the state acts. 
In 2023, the state passed a climate law that requires utilities to fully transition to clean energy by 2040. But the law includes an “offramp” that allows utilities to keep fossil fuel plants online, or build new gas plants, if clean energy can’t handle the grid’s load. 
Whitmer signs climate change legislation setting 100% clean energy standard for Michigan by 2040 

Data centers require a huge amount of energy, and those planned for Michigan are poised to trigger the offramp. 
Utilities view data centers as a lifeline because they make far more money off of capital investments for gas than they do for renewable energy generation. 
Already, DTE and Consumers are making plans for new gas plants. 
“When we’re looking ahead at a data center rush in Michigan, the enormous stakes of climate action – or inaction – and the rate pressure people are feeling amid a broader affordability crisis, it’s really a pivotal time, and one that demands strong leadership from the attorney general,” Weinmann said.
Cause for recusal?
While the donations to an attorney general primary race are unusual, utility industry trade groups regularly donate to national attorney general campaign groups. And the utility industry isn’t alone. 
Crypto and gambling industry interests in recent years gave huge donations to national attorney general groups that pass money on to state candidates who would later work the industries’ cases, Holman noted. 
Some judges have recused themselves from cases involving campaign donors, he added, but they are the exception and not the norm. Professional ethical guidelines do not demand judges or prosecutors recuse themselves from cases, but they should, Holman said. 
More broadly, the situation highlights the need for reform, he added. 
“It’s just a pure conflict of interest and the ideal solution is to go to public financing and avoid significant public contributions altogether,” Holman added.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Facetune_11-06-2024-14-19-36-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 07:57:26.376274
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-01 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Why CT lawmakers may take up universal school meals issue in 2026,Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/01/ct-universal-school-meals-legislative-session-2026/,Disruptions to programs like SNAP have renewed calls for CT to do what it can to ensure that children are fed in schools.,"With food insecurity on the rise and changes to programs like SNAP, some Connecticut lawmakers are making a renewed push to pass legislation during the 2026 session that would guarantee universal meals for students across the state, regardless of their school district. Currently, students have access to a mix of free, reduced price and paid meals, depending on household income, with some districts opting to provide free meals to all children.
Here’s what you need to know about universal school meals in Connecticut and why it may come up in next year’s legislative session.
Who is eligible for free school meals in Connecticut?
There are three ways student meals work in Connecticut schools. 
First, there are students who get free meals — meaning breakfast and lunch. A family of four qualifies if they make less than $41,795 before taxes for the 2025-26 school year.
There are also students whose families pay a reduced fee for school meals. Again for a family of four, these families must make less than $59,478 before taxes. 
And there are students whose families pay full price because their income exceeds the limits for free or reduced price meals. Lunch for these students typically costs between $3 and $4.50 depending on the school district.
But some districts offer free meals to all children. How does that work? 
Under the Community Eligibility Provision, or CEP, if more than 25% of a school’s population qualifies for free meals, then the school can choose to serve all students free breakfast and lunch. The school can then be reimbursed with federal funds, at a rate of 1.6. That means, if 40% of students at the school qualify for free meals, the school will be reimbursed for 1.6 times that amount, or 64%. The school will then have to find funds within its budget for the other 36% of the student population’s meals. Some districts have a high enough percentage of students who qualify that they do not have to contribute any additional funds.
There are also a handful of districts that provide universal breakfast, but not lunch. 
How many Connecticut districts offer free meals to students? 
Currently, 63 districts participate, but at 12 of those districts the program is only available at some of the schools. That’s out of a total of 202 school districts in the state. 
My district used to offer universal meals but doesn’t anymore. Why? 
In 2023, the FDA changed the CEP provision so that schools with 25% of students qualifying for free meals could opt-in to provide universal meals. Previously, the threshold was set at 40%. Some Connecticut school districts that fell within that 25% to 40% range decided to opt-in, but later determined the program was too expensive to continue and chose to opt back out. 
What kind of food do students receive as part of universal meals in Connecticut? 
There is no universal menu that school districts must follow in Connecticut, so different districts contract with different vendors. But all student lunches must include five components: a dairy, protein, starch, vegetable and fruit. 
Why do lawmakers and advocates want to provide universal meals in Connecticut, even in wealthy districts? 
Food insecurity is hitting Connecticut residents hard. Disruptions to programs like SNAP caused by the government shutdown and populations being shut out of the program altogether have renewed calls for the state to do what it can to ensure that children are fed. The One Big Beautiful Bill act excludes certain groups from SNAP benefits, including refugees and asylum seekers from access to SNAP benefits as well as some young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness.
But even before those restrictions were put in place, lawmakers in Connecticut have advocated for universal school meals for a number of reasons.
While some school districts in Connecticut may have a low percentage of students who quality for free meals, lawmakers and advocates say that making such meals universal has a number of benefits. First, when meals are available at no cost, participation in these programs go up.
“It changes the culture of the school meal program,” said Marlene Schwartz, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy & Health at the University of Connecticut. “It doesn’t become just a program seen as something low-income kids participate in, it becomes something everybody does,” reducing stigma and ensuring that kids who are hungry are fed. Children with full bellies, advocates say, are able to focus on learning.
Making such a program universal would also cut out the cost and time of the paperwork associated with parsing what meals are available to which students. That would allow directors of food programs to focus their time and energy on getting the best quality food to their students. Feeding more kids would also give smaller districts greater purchasing power to make bulk deals with vendors. 
In Connecticut, the high cost of living also means that there are many families who do not currently qualify for free meals, but who are struggling with the cost of groceries and would greatly benefit, according to Schwartz. 
“The gap between the amount you can make to no longer qualify and amount of money you need to take care of a family of four in Connecticut is many thousands of dollars, and in that gap are a lot of people who need help and aren’t getting it,” she said. Because low- income families qualify for free lunch, Schwartz said that most people assume that all kids who need free meals get them. “No, they don’t!” she said. “They don’t!”
How would Connecticut fund universal meals?
That remains to be seen, but one of the proposals on the table is a tax on sugary drinks. Schwartz, for one, is in favor of this idea. 
“I thought that was the most brilliant idea I had ever heard,” she said. “A public health home run.” Because drinks like soda are linked with negative health outcomes, cities across the U.S. have used such taxes as a method to fight obesity and diabetes while simultaneously raising money for quality of life improvements for their citizens.
Philadelphia, for example, taxes such drinks at 1.5 cents per ounce and has used those funds to pay for a free preschool program, among other initiatives.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8240-scaled-e1691432418382.jpg,,,2025-12-01 07:57:26.376274

(Courtesy of Michael Garcia)Early voting was still a few weeks away when, in September, the announcement came down. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham was offering her endorsement to JoAnne Vigil Coppler in the crowded race to replace two-term Santa Fe Mayor Alan Webber.
“I kind of jokingly-but-seriously said, ‘After I win, I’m still going to reach out to you because I want to strongly partner,’” Michael Garcia said of his comments to the governor. Garcia, a city councilor who on Nov. 4 won the eight-person ranked choice election, will take office in January. “To address the challenges that the city is facing, it’s going to require a strong coalition built between the city, the governor’s office, our state legislative delegation, the county, our federal delegation,” he said.
For Garcia, those challenges range from the simple, like finding someone to fill his soon-to-be-vacant seat representing District 2 on the Santa Fe City Council and finding a building to serve as the new “Southside Mayor’s Office,” to the complex, like addressing the “decades of deferred maintenance” on the city’s roads and tackling regional issues of affordable housing and homelessness. For issues like the latter, he said he hopes to work with residents and officials at the local, county and state levels to identify and solve shared problems.
In recent years, tensions between city and state leaders have at times spilled into the public’s view. In 2023, the state Department of Finance and Administration took back more than $1 million that had previously been earmarked for the city’s parks because of the city’s failure to meet auditing deadlines. And in 2024, Lujan Grisham told reporters that the City of Santa Fe had “an obvious leadership problem” during litigation over the controversial Plaza monument known locally as the “obelisk.”
Garcia said he hopes to move past those incidents and build a strong relationship with state officials.
When he takes office in January, he will have a long list of day-one tasks. He said he hopes to issue a call to the public to replace his seat on the City Council and find creative ways to solicit public feedback, like a town-hall style forum, before officially nominating them for the job. He also said he’s working to establish a mayoral office on the city’s Southside and plans to split his time between there and City Hall.
He’s also exploring whether to start fresh with the city’s top non-elected officials. He plans to post job listings for influential positions including city manager, city clerk, city attorney and more. The people currently in those jobs are invited to re-apply, he said.

Before he issues policy proposals, he said he wants to meet with department heads in City Hall and better assess their needs. For example, he wants to issue a strategic plan to guide the city’s development of workforce and affordable housing. On his first day as mayor, he said, he’ll get to work on figuring out what works best for the city — whether it’s tiny houses, townhomes, traditional single-family homes or something in between. 
He also wants to focus on the capital city’s aging infrastructure. Across the state, roads have deteriorated to their worst condition in recent history, according to a new state analysis. Garcia said it’s “incumbent” on city leaders to craft strategic plans on addressing infrastructure needs and making the plans for road closures and paving easily accessible to the public.
“We have years, and if not years, I would say decades of deferred maintenance on road infrastructure,” he said.
He said he plans to take a similar approach to homelessness and substance abuse. City leaders over the summer spoke publicly about their plans to move away from relying on shelters and to embrace “micro-communities” with tiny homes. These issues are felt acutely across New Mexico — when volunteers conducting a “point in time” count of unhoused people documented a 10% decrease from 2024 to 2025, the report attributed the decline to a lack of volunteers running the count.
Addressing social issues like these require a different approach than aging roads, Garcia said, because the response has to be “organic.” He hesitated to “put a date” to when his office will produce plans on any of these issues and said he wants to work with city staffers and residents in 2026 to determine holistic responses to these problems.
“Before major investments are made, there needs to be strong buy-in from the residents,” he said. “We are going to be an administration that is engaging residents as we’re going through the decision-making process. They’re not going to be an afterthought.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6616.jpg,,,2025-12-01 07:57:26.376274

Whether one thinks school district consolidations or mergers would be beneficial for Vermont or not is immaterial in regard to the fundamental issue raised by the Vermont school redistricting task force’s move to thwart the intent and requirements of Vermont law concerning the future of our pre-K-12 schools.
The task force has grossly abused its privilege as an appointed policy group by deciding to, essentially, disobey the law and thwart the process that our elected representatives designed for school reform.
Our elected Legislature and governor, with much research and then debate, set a policy direction for Vermont school governance, operations and finance. It is not in any way, the prerogative of this small group to take it upon themselves to thwart the process set forth in law, for reorganizing our educational system.

That thousands of people who purportedly came forth to voice concern or opposition to the law, is transparently the result of organized, concerted political activism.
While it is important to listen to and respect voices of concern, there is no reason per se to think that this is a “groundswell” representing the overall will of Vermonters as a whole. In fact, our 2025 Vermont Legislature and governor duly elected by Vermont citizens, set this policy into law. 
The Task Force, as well as “anti-merger” activists, in six months of activity, have generated through these actions an undue, large amount of worry, fear and anxiety over the idea of changing the way we do schooling.
As well, the task force itself has demonstrated a shockingly myopic narrow-mindedness regarding research on school reorganization and reform and organizational change — and also a  stunning lack of respect for the will of Vermonters, who have said that the status quo of our schools — educationally and financially — is no longer working and needs dramatic change, very soon.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first used the term “AIDS” on Sept. 24, 1982, more than a year after the first cases appeared in medical records. Those early years of the crisis were marked by a great deal of confusion over what caused the disease, who it affected and how it spread.
But the naming itself – acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, which we now know is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV – was a milestone. How people talked about and named the AIDS crisis shaped how it was viewed and either fostered or countered a culture of stigma.
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, for instance, conservative Christian leaders such as Rev. Jerry Falwell described AIDS as “God’s punishment” for sexual immorality. Many AIDS activists, on the other hand, also took up the importance of naming. Instead of being called “AIDS victims,” they preferred phrases like “people with AIDS” and “people living with HIV” to affirm their status as people rather than merely patients or victims.
As a historian of religion, sexuality and public health, I became interested in how moral and religious rhetoric shaped this global pandemic from the start. In my book “After the Wrath of God,” I trace how the AIDS crisis could not be separated from the broader cultural contexts in which it emerged, including the histories of LGBTQ+ people and the Christian right.
In other words, from the start, this medical epidemic was also a moral epidemic.
Before ‘AIDS’

	
The naming of AIDS in 1982 came more than a year after the CDC first reported cases of young, otherwise healthy men diagnosed with rare forms of cancer, pneumonia and other infections that occur in people with weakened immune systems.
CDC researchers searched for a connection and found that these men were “all active homosexuals.” This confirmed what many gay and bisexual men living in places such as New York City and San Francisco already knew: There was a mysterious illness affecting their community.
Early news coverage described a new “gay cancer” or “gay pneumonia.” Some medical researchers called it GRID – gay-related immune deficiency – or acquired community immune deficiency. When CDC leaders settled on AIDS instead, they wanted to acknowledge the prevalence of cases among many other groups, including heterosexuals.
Despite these efforts, however, this early association with homosexuality would stick.
In fact, the history of homosexuality was crucial to the very discovery of AIDS. Scientists have now shown that HIV circulated well before 1981, especially among intravenous drug users, many of whom were homeless. But unusual illnesses and deaths within this population largely went unnoticed.
Meanwhile, the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement had been picking up steam since 1969, when a police raid at the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City, set off a series of riots that prompted a new wave of LGBTQ+ activism. By the 1980s, queer and trans people asserted greater political and cultural influence.
This visibility and increasing cultural influence were crucial to the detection of this new disease.
Stirring ‘God’s wrath’

	
The early association of AIDS with homosexuality also ensured that this public health crisis would stir moral and religious debate.

In the 1970s, conservative Christian leaders had already warned the broader public about what they considered to be an epidemic of homosexuality. They argued that social acceptance of LGBTQ+ people was a sign of moral decline, and warned that if the United States did not stamp out this “moral disease,” the country would face the same fate as Sodom and Gomorrah, biblical cities destroyed by God.
In other words, the Christian right already had its own way to talk about homosexuality as an epidemic, as a threat to society itself. The AIDS crisis seemed to only confirm their belief in God’s wrath.
Medical and public health officials were not immune to this rhetoric. In the 1980s, at hospitals across New York, people readily referred to WOGS – the wrath of God syndrome. A physician at the Medical College of Georgia penned an editorial for Southern Medical Journal that asked whether AIDS fulfilled a biblical pronouncement about “the due penalty” for sexual sins and recommended conversion therapy for homosexuals.
In the White House, as historian Jennifer Brier has shown, President Ronald Reagan’s conservative advisers Gary Bauer and William Bennett formulated a strategy to fight AIDS that emphasized the moral righteousness of heterosexuality and abstinence outside of marriage.
They were frustrated to get pushback from the Reagan-appointed Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, a pediatric surgeon who had also become one of the leaders of the evangelical pro-life movement. He insisted that national AIDS policy focus on comprehensive sex education.

(The pamphlet sent to American homes in 1988 by the U.S. Surgeon General and the Centers for Disease Control, U.S. Public Health Services/National Library of Medicine via Wikimedia Commons. )
In 1988, Koop sent a mailer called Understanding AIDS to virtually every household in America. Conservatives balked at Koop’s approach, although he still prioritized abstinence for people who were unmarried as the best form of protection.
Bauer and Bennett complained that the flyer included information about condoms and described the risks of contagion through oral and anal sex. Phyllis Schlafly, the conservative Catholic crusader against feminism, abortion and gay rights, accused the surgeon general of trying to teach “safe sodomy” to third graders.
Beyond the Christian right

	
Not all conservative Christians understood AIDS to be God’s punishment for sexual sin. Many evangelical groups and Catholic leaders even pushed against that notion – yet still spoke of it in religious and moral terms.
Cardinal John O’Connor, the archbishop of New York, drew the ire of many AIDS activists when he spoke about AIDS at the Vatican in 1989. “Good morality,” he proclaimed, “is good medicine.”
Many Christians took more progressive positions. Southern Baptist ethicist Earl Shelp and chaplain Ronald Sunderland worked as research fellows at Texas Medical Center, where they first encountered people with AIDS. Together, they started one of the earliest AIDS ministry programs, which focused on helping gay men with AIDS without judgment.

And many queer and feminist Christian and Jewish leaders, including Jim Mitulski, Yvette Flunder and Yoel Kahn, forged queer-affirming and justice-oriented responses to the stigma of AIDS. They countered the idea that AIDS was a “gay disease,” but they also focused on how AIDS harmed populations that were often sidelined, including people of color, women and drug users.
What’s in a name?

	
Today, when I teach about the history of the HIV/AIDS crisis, my students tend to be confused by this early association with homosexuality. They associate AIDS with sub-Saharan Africa, which had become the epicenter of the pandemic by the 1990s.
Nevertheless, my students have grown up in a world where AIDS is far better understood. Thanks to the work of activists and scientists, far more people now know that HIV can be blocked by using condoms and sterile needles. Antiretroviral therapy has proven very effective in treating people able to obtain and tolerate the medicines.
Yet no matter how scientific or objective people hope to be, epidemics are shaped by culture. And studying that history helps us understand more about ourselves.

The readers are mounted everywhere from street poles to police patrol cars. They take pictures of vehicles and use artificial intelligence to analyze the data. Police can use the information, stored in a database, to track vehicles that could be tied to criminal investigations. 
At least 16 states regulate the readers. Washington does not. 
The technology has become increasingly common in Washington and across the country and is used not only by police, but also businesses and community groups.
Washington’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is leading the charge to regulate the license plate readers here. The issue has taken on new urgency during the Trump administration’s campaign for mass deportations, said Tee Sannon, the organization’s technology policy program director.
A report last month out of the University of Washington found several local police departments authorized U.S. Border Patrol to use their license plate reader databases. And in other cases, Border Patrol had backdoor access without express permission. In some instances, police conducted searches on behalf of the federal agency. 
The findings raise concerns about compliance with state law limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.
In a statement, the head of the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs acknowledged the concerns. Executive Director Steve Strachan attributed the issue to sharing permissions allowing the feds to access plate reader data unbeknownst to local police.
“We continue to remind our members to be aware of their system restrictions to ensure that their data is only shared consistent with Washington law and agency policy,” Strachan said.
Worries extend beyond immigration. 
Authorities in Texas this year searched thousands of the cameras, as far as Washington state and Illinois, in their search for a woman believed to have had a self-administered abortion.
Anxieties over public record access to data from the readers have already spurred some Washington cities to rethink using them.
The proposal
The legislation in Washington, which is still being drafted, wouldn’t ban license plate readers. It looks to put guardrails on them in two main ways. 
One is how long agencies can hold onto the data. Currently, the information can sit indefinitely, though police departments have internal retention policies. The standard for Flock, the leading company making the cameras, is to delete pictures after 30 days if the images have no value. 
“A lot of this risk goes away if you ensure that the data is deleted,” Sannon said. “It can’t fall into the wrong hands. It can’t be requested or misused if it’s just being regularly deleted.”
The draft legislation pegs the retention period at 72 hours, said the planned prime sponsor, Sen. Yasmin Trudeau, D-Tacoma. There would be exceptions, for example, if holding onto the data helps with investigating a violent crime.
Cities feel three days isn’t enough time. 
“If you are trying to investigate a crime and determine where a stolen vehicle is ending up, you may need more than 72 hours,” said Candice Bock, government relations director at the Association of Washington Cities.
Some states allow longer retention periods, for weeks or even months. On the other end of the spectrum, most data from readers in New Hampshire has to be purged within three minutes.
The other issue the proposal seeks to address is how agencies can share their data. The policy would prohibit departments from giving direct access to license plate reader databases, Sannon said. Agencies would have to get a search warrant to access data from other departments, she added.
Some local officials also see this as potentially problematic. Bock noted “criminals don’t stop at the city limits,” so data sharing between, for example, neighboring police agencies is key to the success of automated license plate readers. 
To Trudeau, the regulations seem like a “no-brainer.”
“It’s not anything crazy,” she said. “It’s just about making sure we’ve got a framework that people can respect.”
Trudeau compared it to legislation she spearheaded in 2024 to ban police hog-tying, when there was some consensus that a change was needed.
“When I’ve had conversations with Flock directly or law enforcement, I think most folks are like, ‘No, we want to operate, but we know there’s going to be a bill. We want to be involved in a bill. We understand that there should be a policy,’” she said. “So they’re all at the table in good faith.”
Conversations around the bill began before the UW report was released in October.
Flock didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Trudeau hopes to file the proposed legislation before the Legislature convenes for a 60-day session Jan. 12. The bill will then need to pass both the Senate and House before Gov. Bob Ferguson can sign it.
In 2019, lawmakers in Washington state put forward legislation to shorten the readers’ retention periods and limit their use, but the proposal didn’t gain traction. 
Similar discussions are expected next year in the Oregon Legislature. 
Public records concerns
Law enforcement agencies also want to see changes to state law on automated license plate readers. But their focus is on public disclosure of reader data through record requests.
A Skagit County judge last month ruled the pictures and other information the cameras capture must be made available through the state’s Public Records Act. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit against Stanwood and Sedro-Woolley. The cities have appealed.
Some cities, including Redmond and Lynnwood, have suspended their license plate reader programs in response to the ruling and immigration concerns.
Local jurisdictions worry they’ll be overloaded with public disclosure requests related to their license plate readers, and that public safety will be threatened by allowing anyone access to the whereabouts of anyone’s license plate, whether they’re connected to a crime or not.

“If somebody can request the images, the license plates through the Public Records Act, then there is no ability to control who is getting access to this and how they’re using it,” Bock said.
Police and city officials hope to exempt their reader data from disclosure under state public records law as part of Trudeau’s planned legislation. Bock hopes for something similar to the state’s treatment of red light cameras. Those images and the personally identifying information they capture aren’t releasable under state law.
Other states, including Florida, Nebraska and North Carolina, have exempted the data from their public records laws.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/license-plate-reader-1024x701.jpg,,,2025-12-01 07:57:26.376274

(Getty Images)The months-long political drama over possible Indiana congressional redistricting has snarled up campaign plans for some Hoosiers with U.S. House ambitions.
Indiana House members are returning to the Statehouse this week for debate over President Donald Trump’s demand for Republican-led states to draw more GOP-leaning congressional districts.
Uncertainty clouds whether such a plan will clear the Republican-dominated state Senate. Such has been the campaign ambiguity since August when Indiana became ensnared in the national redistricting debate.
“It’s definitely muddied the waters,” said Randy Niemeyer, who was the 2024 Republican challenger to Democratic U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan and is considering a 2026 run.
Northwestern Indiana’s 1st Congressional District now held by Mrvan has been in Democratic hands since the 1930s. But it has trended more Republican in the Trump era and is seen as the easiest potential GOP pickup in the state.
The current 1st District takes in all of Indiana’s Lake Michigan shoreline areas, including all of Lake and Porter counties and part of LaPorte County. Many unofficial map proposals create a more Republican district by pairing Lake County — the state’s second-most populous — with numerous rural counties to the south and southeast.
The uncertainty of what map will be used for the 2026 election hangs over many campaign decisions, said Niemeyer, who is the Lake County Republican chair and a County Council member.
“It becomes a factor in fundraising,” Niemeyer said in an interview. “It becomes a factor in a ground game. You’re talking about a difference between covering two and a half counties and possibly 12 or 13 counties. What I’ve kind of been doing in my own consideration is, ‘All right, let’s build two business models and see what this looks like.’”
Republican hopeful faces unknowns
Similar troubles exist for candidates in what are now among solidly Republican districts.
Redrawing maps so that all nine of Indiana’s congressional districts favor Republicans would mean also carving up the heavily Democratic 7th District in Indianapolis now held by Rep. Andre Carson.
That could mean a chunk of Indianapolis going into the 4th District, where state Rep. Craig Haggard is challenging four-term U.S. Rep. Jim Baird for the Republican nomination.

Haggard said he’s spent most of the past two years traveling the district that spans from the western suburbs of Indianapolis more than a hundred miles north to the Kankakee River separating Lake and Newton counties.
“I’ve spent a lot of resources. I have volunteer coordinators in each of those counties,” Haggard said. “They could go away. It really could upend everything and then I have a very, very short time to start over again.”
Indiana’s candidate filing period for the 2026 primaries opens Jan. 7 and closes Feb. 6. Early voting is scheduled to start April 7 for the Republican and Democratic primaries on May 5.
So even though U.S. House candidates aren’t required to live in their districts, most serious campaigns for a congressional seat start months or years ahead of the filing period — especially with fundraising.
Haggard acknowledged some potential financial supporters were holding back until the district lines were finalized, but said he believed that was a small percentage.
The most recent Federal Election Commission reports show Haggard raised $49,500 during the three months ending Sept. 30, compared to Baird’s $70,610. Haggard’s campaign had about $117,000 in the bank, while Baird had $182,000.
Complications for Carson challenger 
George Hornedo has faced an even more complicated political landscape since May when he announced his Democratic primary challenge to Carson in the 7th District.
Hornedo says he is pressing on despite the prospect of the district being split up among perhaps two or three others to favor Republicans.

Hornedo, an attorney who was a staffer with Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 presidential campaign, decided to narrow his campaign team’s focus to northern Indianapolis, knocking on doors and making phone calls to both oppose redistricting and support his candidacy.
“Every ounce of volunteer energy, every phone banking shift, every hour canvassing, it was going to identify and support us for the campaign, but also educating neighbors with what’s at stake with redistricting and helping to enable them to take action,” he said.
Hornedo had an initial burst of fundraising success, collecting nearly $160,000 in the first three-month period when he announced his bid. That dropped to about $18,000 for the three months ending Sept. 30, leaving his campaign with about $43,000.
Carson, who has held the House seat since 2008, ended September with more than $600,000, having raised about $155,000 in the previous three months.
Hornedo said he is committed to a 2026 campaign regardless of how the redistricting debate plays out.
“I would organize in whatever the new district is, but I would continue to organize in the district as it is now — Indianapolis at large — because part of the reason I got into this race was talking about rebuilding the Democratic Party from the bottom up,” he said.
Carson’s campaign said it is running a coordinating effort “to support Democrats up and down the ballot.
“This year, that work has continued — and the congressman has also collaborated with local leaders to raise the alarm on redistricting,” Carson spokesperson Caroline Ellert said in a statement.
Democratic enthusiasm boost?
The biggest political change from the 2021 congressional maps drawn by Republicans after the 2020 census was strengthening the GOP’s hold on central Indiana’s 5th District following U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz’s narrow 2020 general election win for her first term.
Spartz easily defeated Democratic candidates in the 2022 and 2024 elections, even after surviving a tight Republican primary last year.
No 2026 Republican challengers have emerged against Spartz as the redistricting debate has lingered.
But Democrats say they have stirred up animosity among voters with a redistricting push that they see as unfair.
“They want to know where the district lines are, but people are just paying attention to what’s going on and they’re stepping up,” said 5th District Democratic chair Terri Austin, a former state legislator from Anderson. “They’re stepping up in their activism. They’re stepping up to run for local office and they’re fired up. They really are.”
Mrvan challengers jumping in
Mrvan, the Democratic congressman from northwestern Indiana, told an anti-redistricting rally at the Statehouse in August that he planned to seek reelection next year “no matter what district they put me in.”
Mrvan argued Trump was pushing redistricting to help Republicans overcome unpopular policies and retain a narrow U.S. House majority.
“They are afraid, they are afraid to face voters,” Mrvan said during the rally.
A Mrvan spokeswoman did not return recent messages seeking additional comment.
The unknown makeup of the 1st District hasn’t stopped Republicans from entering the race to possibly challenge Mrvan.
Those who’ve already declared candidacies include Porter County Commissioner Barb Regnitz and Jennifer-Ruth Green, who got 47% of the vote in a 2022 loss to Mrvan.
Former state cabinet secretary announces congressional run

Green announced her new campaign in October, the month after she resigned as public safety secretary for Gov. Mike Braun’s administration. She has denied allegations of ghost employment and misuse of state property made by the state inspector general in a formal ethics complaint.
Green campaign spokesman Tim Edson said in a statement that Green “is receiving a lot of support from Republican activists, donors and Hoosiers across the Region excited to have an outsider, a conservative and a fighter who will stand with President Trump in this race.  We remain confident Indiana will redraw the congressional map to combat Democrats efforts to rig the game through gerrymandering and counting illegal immigrants in the census.”
The Regnitz campaign did not reply to messages seeking comment.
Some Republican legislators who oppose the redistricting push argue that it has taken focus away from supporting a GOP candidate against Mrvan.
Niemeyer said he would be making a decision soon about seeking a rematch against Mrvan and scoffed at the argument the redistricting debate hurts Republican candidates.
“We built a really legitimate campaign and not a single one of those people saying that lent a hand,” Niemeyer said. “I find it to be a very hollow statement and actually a statement that is trying to deflect what’s at play, because I doubt that they will help.”
GOP U.S. House members in support
All seven of Indiana’s current Republican U.S. House members have endorsed Trump’s redistricting call — despite not seeing what those new maps might look like.
Baird, the 4th District incumbent, said he would be running for reelection “no matter what the final map looks like.”
“I would hate to lose any of my constituents, but I also recognize how important it is for Indiana to get this process right so every Hoosier has a fair voice in Washington,” Baird wrote in an email.
Baird said he trusted the Legislature “to do what is right for Indiana and all Hoosiers.”
“Neither my staff nor I have been involved in drafting any maps,” Baird wrote. “That responsibility lies solely with the Indiana General Assembly.”
Haggard, the legislator from Mooresville challenging Baird, said he supported the redistricting push despite the impact on his candidacy.
“If I can’t handle this, I shouldn’t go to Congress anyway,” Haggard said. “… It hurts a campaign like mine but at the end of the day, I think that this is bigger than me.”

We have always worked to advocate for American ideals and values, sometimes in partnership with Republicans when it made sense for Indiana, and sometimes in competition with Republicans when we disagreed on a policy issue or an approach.
Targeting Congressmen André Carson and Frank Mrvan to gerrymander their districts before a mid-term election is dangerous, wrong and beyond the common sense Hoosiers traditionally show. These members, duly elected to represent their districts, work hard each day to listen to the needs of their constituents, solve problems and deliver for the families, workers, students, and seniors in their communities. They won their elections fair and square – and in the case of Congressman Mrvan – against well-funded opponents financed by the national donors.
Everywhere you go in this state, Hoosiers will tell you their biggest concern is the soaring cost of groceries, utility bills and healthcare. Indiana governors have the ability to call the General Assembly in for special legislative sessions for emergencies. The fact that the legislature is coming in early to redistrict instead of addressing real problems like Indiana’s affordability crisis, shows just how out of touch the GOP supermajority is with everyday Hoosiers.
Even former two-term Republican Governor Mitch Daniels has denounced this idea. Republicans should take heed of his statement that districts should make geographic sense, particularly if they attempt to split Marion County, which is represented by the dean of Indiana’s congressional delegation, Congressman Carson.
Competition is good for democracy, and it’s good for our country and state. It starts with healthy debates and leads to more balanced outcomes for all people. Hoosiers deserve a congressional map where every district is competitive and voters choose their representatives, not the other way around.
But the political insiders in D.C don’t want competition. They want to predetermine the results of the next election before the first vote is even cast.
We have all won elections. We have all lost elections. We have always accepted the outcome because we knew that at the end of the campaign it was the choices of Hoosiers that bestowed political power on us – not the parties that granted it before the votes were even counted. Hoosiers deserve a better government, and that starts with a politics that is fair and not rigged by people outside this great state.
We urge our fellow Hoosiers of all political viewpoints to recognize this blatant power grab to rig the 2026 midterm elections. Indiana’s legislature should not waste Hoosier taxpayer dollars on a purely political activity. Hoosiers need to make their voices heard now.

New auto assembly plants create thousands of new jobs and generally receive an enthusiastic welcome in Michigan, which prizes high-paying, blue-collar jobs. Economists say one assembly plant job leads to the creation of about four spin-off jobs, spreading wealth throughout the region where that plant is located.
Automakers have typically been among the biggest capital spenders in Michigan. But the latest headline-grabbing project, said by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to be the “largest one-time investment in state history,” is not an auto plant. And everyone hates it.
Well, maybe not everyone. But the announcement of a $7 billion-plus data center in Washtenaw County’s Saline Township has created an uproar among local officials and residents.  And it is slated to create only about 400 permanent jobs. It would be Michigan’s first hyperscale data center.

State Attorney General Dana Nessel has jumped into the controversy, asking the Michigan Public Service Commission to slow DTE Energy’s roll in fast-tracking a contract to provide electric service to the Saline Township center.
Massive data centers, which can cover millions of square feet and suck up enough electricity to power a large city, are being built all over the world to power artificial intelligence models that promise (or threaten) to change the way we work and live.
In Michigan, outrage isn’t just aimed at the Saline Township center, known as “Stargate,” being developed by Open AI, Oracle and Related Digital. Residents and environmental groups are mobilizing against more than a handful of data center projects across the state.
Kalkaska residents beat back a data center proposal in late November. And Howell Township has enacted a six-month data center moratorium because of residents’ pushback against them.

Opposition to data centers focuses on fears that they will lead to skyrocketing electric rates for nearby residents, dry up water supplies needed to cool the tens of thousands of tightly packed computer servers inside the centers and destroy the rural character of places where many of the centers are locating.
But the overarching worry about data centers is their role in powering a boom in potentially destructive artificial intelligence. AI’s backers cite a variety of potential benefits, including the ability to find cures for diseases, boosting worker productivity and powering tremendous economic growth.
AI also could wipe out humanity, not something desired in economic development projects.
Even the leaders of AI companies say they’re not exactly sure what they’re unleashing.

And while some experts say AI could create new jobs we haven’t even thought of yet and might not displace all that many current jobs, others predict massive losses as many human functions are taken over by the technology.

It’s no wonder that just 17% percent of U.S. adults in a recent Pew Research Center poll said they think AI will have a positive effect on the country over the next 20 years.
Nevertheless, the builders of data centers and AI are pushing ahead, spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers in a battle for supremacy in AI, which they believe will bring them untold riches.
The so-called “Magnificent Seven” stocks—Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (formerly Google), Meta (formerly Facebook), Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla—make up more than a third of the S&P 500’s total market value. All seven companies are heavily involved in AI projects.
Massive AI spending is propping up a sluggish U.S. economy, leading to fears that an enormous AI bubble could burst and take down much of the rest of the economy.
And it’s possible that Michigan’s bet on data centers might not pay off. Those of us who have lived here for decades know that many of the auto assembly and parts plants state policymakers have worked to attract ultimately closed, due in part to work being outsourced to other countries.
And while it seems implausible now, something similar could happen with data centers. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and other AI pioneers say hyperscale data centers could go where none have gone before: to the moon.
“We will be able to beat the cost of terrestrial data centers in space in the next couple of decades,” Bezos said at a recent tech conference in Italy.
Moon-based data centers would run on solar power, which would be essentially free, Bezos said. Data center information would be beamed back to Earth.
That would be the mother of all outsourcing.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2115899404-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-01 07:57:26.376274

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-01 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Wicker and other lawmakers want congressional review of Trump’s military strikes on boats,Associated Press,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/01/wicker-review-military-strikes-boats/,Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi says in a joint statement with Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island that the Armed Services Committee is looking into U.S. strikes on suspected narcotics boats in the Caribbean Sea.,"WASHINGTON — Lawmakers from both parties say they support congressional reviews of U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, citing a published report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order for all crew members to be killed as part of a Sept. 2 attack.
The lawmakers said they did not know whether last week’s Washington Post report was true, and some Republicans were skeptical, but they said attacking survivors of an initial missile strike poses serious legal concerns.
“This rises to the level of a war crime if it’s true,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said Sunday.
Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, when asked about a follow-up strike aimed at people no longer able to fight, said Congress does not have information that happened. He noted that leaders of the Armed Services Committee in both the House and Senate have opened investigations.
“Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious and I agree that that would be an illegal act,” Turner said Sunday.
Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and its top Democrat, Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, said in a joint statement late Friday that the committee “will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.”
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump on Sunday evening while flying back to Washington from Florida, where he celebrated Thanksgiving, confirmed that he had recently spoken with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
The U.S. administration says the strikes in the Caribbean are aimed at cartels, some of which it claims are controlled by Maduro. Trump also is weighing whether to carry out strikes on the Venezuelan mainland.
Trump declined to comment on details of the call, which was first reported by The New York Times.
“I wouldn’t say it went well or badly,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, when asked about the call.
The Venezuelan communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the call with Trump.
Turner said there are concerns in Congress about the attacks on vessels that the Trump administration says are transporting drugs, but the allegation regarding the Sept. 2 attack “is completely outside anything that has been discussed with Congress and there is an ongoing investigation.”
The comments from lawmakers come as the administration escalates a campaign to combat drug trafficking into the U.S. 
On Saturday, Trump said the airspace “above and surrounding” Venezuela should be considered as “closed in its entirety,” an assertion that raised more questions about the U.S. pressure on Maduro. Maduro’s government accused Trump of making a ”colonial threat” and seeking to undermine the South American country’s sovereignty.
After the Post’s report, Hegseth said Friday on X that “fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland.”
“Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict—and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command,” Hegseth wrote.
Trump said on Sunday the administration “will look into” the matter but added, “I wouldn’t have wanted that — not a second strike.” The president also defended Hegseth.
“Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,” Trump said. He added, “And I believe him.”
On Saturday, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, and the ranking Democratic member, Washington Rep. Adam Smith, issued a joint statement saying the panel was committed to “providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defense’s military operations in the Caribbean.”
“We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,” Rogers and Smith said, referring to U.S. Southern Command.
Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., asked about the Sept. 2 attack, said Hegseth deserves a chance to present his side.
“We should get to the truth. I don’t think he would be foolish enough to make this decision to say, kill everybody, kill the survivors because that’s a clear violation of the law of war,” Bacon said. “So, I’m very suspicious that he would’ve done something like that because it would go against common sense.”
Kaine and Turner appeared on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” and Bacon was on ABC’s “This Week.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/06122924/AP25030639147635.jpg,,,2025-12-01 07:57:26.376274

A mentor of mine always reminded me that when we look ahead and see all the work we need to do, we need to look behind us and see how far we have come. 
When I was in graduate school in the late 70’s,  institutions were the primary providers of mental health care. The limited community services that were available were largely funded through grants from the state and counties. 
In short, there was no mental health system.
Our system isn’t broken; we have spent the past few decades building the foundation of a system. 
There is now a wide array of community services for both children and adults that provide treatments and support and vary in intensity. This is largely due to a shift in 2006 to move services to Medicaid and MinnesotaCare and the subsequent passage of mental health parity laws. These are health care services and should be paid for by health insurance. 
The importance of housing, employment and education were not forgotten, and these important parts of our system also received increased funding. 
Ensuring that people are trained on mental health issues — teachers, police, etc. — was also important to ensure early identification and to decriminalize mental illnesses. 
Despite this progress, we continue to not meet the needs of people with mental illnesses and their families. 
The difference now, versus 30 years ago, is that we know what works — we know the solutions. 
Here’s how to move forward on building our mental health system. 

Invest in early intervention and engagement. As with any health care condition, early identification and treatment yields the best outcomes. The government has not fully funded early episode of psychosis programs despite the evidence that it prevents young people from developing a disabling condition. There is only one small grant program, which started this fall, that tries to engage people in treatment voluntarily instead of waiting until there is a full-blown crisis. Since 50% of mental illnesses develop by age 14, fully funding our children’s mental health system is important, and programs such as school-linked mental health eliminate barriers by going to where the children are. Routine mental health screenings are sometimes conducted, but there isn’t consistent follow-up. 
Create a robust and diverse workforce. There is a workforce shortage across the state, and our current mental health workforce lacks diversity. There are several programs designed to address the barriers — loan forgiveness, paying for supervision, paying for BIPOC mental health professionals to become supervisors — but the funding doesn’t match the requests. Creating a mental health and substance use disorder workforce office within the Department of Health would direct attention to this issue and support the wide array of people needed in our mental health system, including peer and family peer specialists. We also need a different level of case managers to ensure that people with more experience are assigned to people under commitment. 
Pay the true costs of providing treatment and supports. Low payment rates — especially under Medicaid, which is the largest payer for mental health care — make it difficult to expand services. Rates don’t come close to covering the actual costs. Increase the rates, end the Medicaid policy that won’t pay for care in psych-only facilities with more than 16 beds, and require more services to be paid for under private insurance (enforce parity!).
Separate out children’s mental health from child protection. While some progress has been made, families should not have to go through the child protection system to access residential care. It’s an incredible burden for them to have to do this, threatens their employment, and delays access to needed care.
Create a unified mental health crisis system. When people complain about the number of people with mental illnesses in our jails, we need to ask who brought them there. We need to have a mental health response to a mental health crisis. Every county is covered by a mobile mental health crisis team, yet the statewide funding is less than the budget of most of the individual cities’ police department budgets. We are seeing an increasing number of police departments establish their own teams or co-responder models. This leads to confusion, especially now with “988” the suicide and crisis hotline, raising important questions like, who does what?  And, does HIPAA cover data collected by city teams? Additionally, ever since the deadly use of force law changed, many police have been unwilling to transport people to the hospital unless the person willingly enters the vehicle. While there isn’t research on this, we surmise that more people may be ending up in jail because they were not brought to the hospital. Lastly, stop trying to develop separate crisis centers. Everyone goes to the hospital emergency department  when there is an emergency, so build psychiatric emergency department within existing EDs. 
Pay attention to the social determinants of health. We know that housing, employment and social connections are important to a person’s recovery. Yet funding is very limited. Restrictions on the use of the Medicaid waivers —no more than 25% of the people in a building can be on a waiver — and reliance on “group homes” (four bed homes) offer little choice and insufficient support to people with the most serious mental illnesses. Employment provides a reason to get up in the morning, but the only employment program for people with serious mental illnesses has limited funding. While clubhouses and community support programs help break the isolation so many people with serious mental illnesses experience, not every county offers this program. 

We could do a myriad of other things to build our mental health system. But I think back to President John Kennedy’s quote as he urged our country to close the institutions and to return people to their own communities with the “open warmth of community concern and capability.” 
He added: “It is to be hoped that within a few years the combination of increased mental health insurance coverage, added state and local support, and the redirection of state resources from state mental institutions will help achieve our goal of having community centered mental health services readily accessible to all.” 
That was more than 60 years ago, but I still cling to hope that we can continue to build our mental health system and provide effective and compassionate care and support.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/teenmentalhealth.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 07:57:26.376274

She is sore. She is tired. And she is alone. 
Oscarina and her husband escaped violence in Venezuela and moved 2,000 miles north to Missouri in 2023, seeking more stable housing and a better future for their daughter. Neither have permanent legal status in the United States, and when she learned she had a second child on the way, Oscarina wondered how they could afford to raise another baby. 
Eight weeks into the pregnancy, her husband was detained while delivering a DoorDash order. He was deported back to Venezuela a short time later. 
“All my pregnancy, I cried every single day,” Oscarina, who lives in Kansas City and asked not to use her name out of fear of deportation, told The Independent through an interpreter. 
When she went into labor prematurely earlier this month, her husband cried as he called in over video from Venezuela. 
When their daughter was born, he helped with night feedings. This time, there is no help. And what little money her family had saved up quickly disappeared during the deportation process. 
Now she lives in constant fear about what would happen if she gets detained.
There are days her oldest child doesn’t attend school because Oscarina worries she could be taken while walking her to the bus stop. 
She wonders what the point of the “American Dream” is. Her family suffered under Venezuela’s dictatorship, and in America she suffers, too. 
“I would like to go back to my country,” Oscarina said. “But my husband is saying that things are very bad there right now, and I don’t think it’s a good idea to bring both of the kids right now.” 
So they will remain separated. 
“I live in fear every day,” Oscarina said. “ … It’s too heavy to carry being by myself with my daughter and my little boy and not having my husband because he will always care for us. The fact that he doesn’t get to be with us, everything changed for us.”

Oscarina’s story is one of many shared with The Independent over the past month as women who are undocumented in Missouri navigate pregnancy, birth and postpartum without legal paperwork. 
Several community health care workers, doulas and nonprofits that work with immigrants and expectant mothers shared the struggles the families face. Few were willing to speak on the record, fearful that federal agents could target their offices or the federal government could restrict funding if they spoke out about their work with undocumented immigrants. 
The organizations located across Missouri shared stories of pregnant and postpartum women who’ve shuttered themselves in their homes. Many are facing labor or postpartum in isolation, their husbands deported and the fear of the same fate keeping them housebound, at times too afraid to seek medical care.
Since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been increasingly visible on America’s streets, including in Missouri, sparking protests across the state and nation. Arrests have made headlines as videos circulate of ICE agents detaining parents at school drop-offs and arresting teachers, including inside a preschool. 
In rare cases, ICE has reportedly posted up outside maternity wards.
Under previous administrations, schools, hospitals and churches were considered sanctuary spaces where ICE was not allowed under almost any circumstances. That changed this year, raising new fears for families with young children like Oscarina.
“This is the worst that I’ve seen in many, many years,” said Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the ACLU National Prison Project.
Under former President Joe Biden’s administration, pregnant women were protected from ICE detention. While that policy remains in place, the ACLU earlier this year uncovered several examples of women who were either pregnant or miscarried while in federal detention centers. 
“The trauma it has on children and parents and families is heartbreaking,” Cho said. “And it’s completely unnecessary. These are families that have been living and working and contributing to our communities, often for years or decades.”
 ICE threats send mothers, children into hiding in Missouri

Neysha Reyes Cruz is one of a handful of bilingual doulas in Missouri. 
Through her company, Olas de Amor Doula Services, she has advocated for almost 90 women through pregnancy, birth and postpartum over the past three years. Of those 90, about 70 were undocumented, she said. This year, she estimates she’s stood in as the support person for about half a dozen women who gave birth after a close family member was deported.
Reyes Cruz, who is from Puerto Rico and moved to Missouri in 2016, often serves as an interpreter as well as a doula for her clients, the majority of whom give birth in hospitals. But in recent months, as the threat of ICE raids permeates her Kansas City community, she said her job has increasingly expanded into helping families with more than birth.
Neysha Reyes Cruz, a doula and interpreter in Kansas City, has helped several undocumented women whose husbands were deported shortly before or shortly after their baby was born. (Photo provided by Neysha Reyes Cruz).
The messages she gets from moms are often desperate. One recently asked Reyes Cruz if she could get her formula from the store after the mother said she saw ICE agents out on her street that day.  
Many of her clients skip non-crucial doctor’s appointments. Others miss WIC appointments or have been cut off from food stamps. She has a donation closet to help with clothing and baby supplies.
Instead of going to the pediatrician, many new moms instead call Reyes Cruz to ask if their baby is sick enough to warrant risking leaving the house. The child birth class she used to host in-person is now virtual because too many families feared driving to her.
“I have had moms that have withdrawn their kids from school and have just left the country so those kids never ended their school year. Mamas that were in situations where their partners became so depressed and anxious they started becoming abusive, and from there, having to find refuge for them,” she said. “This is the hardest thing, finding a refuge for a mama that is single, is pregnant or with maybe older kids, does not speak English and doesn’t have a prior family here.”
She encourages her clients to designate someone who is a citizen to get custody of their baby if they’re deported. One mom requested that Reyes Cruz be that person for her baby girl. 
“As a doula, I’m being pushed to support this community because they don’t feel safe with anyone else,” she said.
She fears the elevated stress thrust on these families is affecting their babies. Of the past 10 births she’s attended, five were babies born prematurely. 
Missouri still among worst states for infant, maternal health as new Medicaid cuts loom

Reyes Cruz’s experiences aren’t unique.
A health care provider in the Ozarks who was too afraid to speak on the record said she has Hispanic patients who fear coming into the clinic amid increasingly visible ICE raids around the country.
Other nonprofit workers shared the difficulties of helping parents obtain birth certificates for their newborn children so they could self-deport back to their home country. Legal aid groups help parents establish custody plans in case they are detained and their children are left alone.
Community health workers in urban centers of the state said they are doing more home health visits for pregnant and postpartum women who fear leaving the house, or who are waiting until later in pregnancy to see their doctors. Others help arrange Uber rides to get the women to their appointments. 
“I’m heartbroken for any woman who feels fearful to leave her home, especially to try to receive prenatal care,” said Laura Brandt, director of Pregnancy Help Center of South County in St. Louis.
She said her nonprofit serves anyone who walks through the door and doesn’t question their status.
“This is such a polarizing topic and people have a lot of really strong opinions going either way on the matter,” Brandt said. “Regardless of what your opinions are on a policy level, on a personal level, every human being is deserving of dignity and compassion and care.”
 Some families turn to self-deportation

In just a couple days, Monica is self-deporting. She purchased a one-way flight from Kansas City back to Chile, where she is from. Her 6-month-old son will be on her lap. 
Monica, who asked not to use her name because she is undocumented, moved to the United States on Mother’s Day last year, seeking better education opportunities for her son, who is 8. 
She learned she was pregnant a couple months later. She was sad to be experiencing a new life without her friends and family by her side. 
When she was less than two weeks postpartum, Monica said her husband became violent during an argument. She called her therapist, who reported the abuse to the police. He was arrested and deported back to his home country of Venezuela. 
Monica, who is undocumented, is self-deporting back to Chile with her 6-month-old and 8-year-old sons after her husband was deported from Missouri and she was left without the financial means to continue raising her children in the United States (Photo provided by Monica).
Now alone, Monica can no longer afford to care for her two children on her own. She delivers for DoorDash, and on each trip she fears being caught by immigration agents. Her fear is amplified now that she has a second child. What happens to them if she’s detained?
“Life got more difficult for me,” she said through an interpreter as her son babbled from his perch on her hip.
Tim Rudolph, a St. Louis-based immigration attorney for Hacking Immigration Law, said it’s not uncommon for people to self-deport in today’s political climate. 
He encouraged anyone considering self-deportation to talk with a lawyer first, noting that if someone has a child who is a U.S. citizen, they may have some legal paths to staying in the country if they want to stay. 
“Even though the government is saying ‘if you leave you can come back the right way, we’ll let you do it,’ that’s not often the case,” Rudolph said. “That tends to be what they say to get people out of the country, and a lot of times you’ll be barred from returning.”
While Monica doesn’t yet know if she’ll ever try returning to the U.S., her current vision of her children’s future has been shattered. While she still believes the move to America was worthwhile to attempt to give her children a more promising future, she feels some relief to return home to her parents and to leave the constant fear of deportation behind. 
“People need to be strong emotionally to come over to the United States,” Monica said. “Because even though the United States is a very great country full of opportunities, it can be very emotionally draining to be here with this situation.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2193563646-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-12-01 07:57:26.376274

Timothy Farr knows the importance of having strong support after leaving residential treatment for people with substance use disorder: Now sober, he once faced addiction and homelessness.  
These days he is working to help bridge a gap in services for people facing the same challenges he did. 
Working on an initiative since August, Farr gained the help and resources from the Rutland community to launch Common Ground Recovery. The sober-living nonprofit organization gained 501(c)(3) status and Level 1 preliminary certification from Vermont Alliance for Recovery Residence, and Farr opened the first Common Ground Recovery house on Nov. 7.

The pilot house is a three-bed men’s recovery residence in Rutland City, implementing a peer-run, independent, sober-living community based on the Oxford House Model. There’s an “extreme shortage” of sober-living residences in the state, Farr said, so he hopes the organization gains support to open more housing and expand offerings to more people in recovery. 
“We’ve had some pretty decent grassroots support,” Farr said. “It’s a necessary addition into making Vermont a safer, sober and more equitable place for everybody.” 
The state has recovery residences geared toward higher levels of care and monitoring, but there is a gap in Level 1 residences — which are peer-run houses like Common Ground Recovery — that help people remain in a sober-living community and transition to permanent housing, said Candace Gale, director of community relations for Vermont Foundation of Recovery.
Tracie Hauck, director of Turning Point Center of Rutland, said she is not aware of any Level 1 residences in the Rutland area, and Common Ground Recovery helps provide continuity, independence and longer access to recovery community resources while also freeing up space in residences for people in need of more intensive care.

Advocates have long voiced concern over the lack of “stepdown” facilities in the state, or residences that provide less intensive, long-term housing and resources after people receive short-term, inpatient treatment for substance use disorder and exit more structured residential rehabilitation facilities. 
The lack of recovery communities that help people transition to living independently and rebuild their lives can mean people return to the same circumstances that led to addiction, increasing rates of relapse and recidivism, said Chadd Viger, chief executive officer of the Rutland County-based residential treatment organization Recovery House Inc.
“There’s such a need for sober living once folks leave a residential treatment facility,” Viger said.
Farr said he found the next step in the recovery process was missing after he transitioned from residential treatment services in Rutland County through Recovery House Inc. and completed his stint at the Vermont Foundation of Recovery’s Rutland house.  
Farr said people in recovery often face a big barrier after exiting higher-level care residences, as landlords often deny housing due to low credit scores or past interactions with law enforcement. The area’s affordable housing organizations were also unable to help him secure housing when he was leaving Vermont Foundation of Recovery’s Rutland house, Farr said. So, Farr decided to create the resource he needed. 
“I had no luck. It looked like I was going to be homeless on October 1. I had nowhere to go,” Farr said. “It was born out of necessity, but was also born out of inspiration, because I don’t want to see other folks hit the same roadblocks in their recovery journey.”
Marc Miller, a board member for Common Ground Recovery who works in the recovery community, said he often sees recidivism because resources often drop off after people leave treatment or incarceration.
“I think we have a state that thinks it’s incredibly progressive when it comes to human services, but the infrastructure just simply isn’t there,” Miller said.
He hopes Common Ground Recovery is able to create an environment  where “people have an opportunity to get on their feet rather than fall back into the system,” Miller said.

Missouri sports legends, including St. Louis Rams receiver Isaac Bruce, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez and St. Louis Blues right-winger Brett Hull, will place celebrity bets for the sportsbook’s launch event.
DraftKings’ event will also feature Missouri House Speaker Jon Patterson.
Ex-Royals outfielder Alex Gordon will be promoting Fanatics’ launch by placing a ceremonial first bet at Ameristar Casino Hotel Kansas City. Fanatics also has a retail sportsbook across the state at Ameristar Casino Resort Spa St. Charles.
 Late sportsbook shifts

Two sportsbooks left the Missouri market in the previous weeks. The partnership between ESPN and PENN Entertainment, which created ESPN Bet, announced on Nov. 6 it would disband by Dec. 1, which means Missourians won’t be placing bets there.
However, since PENN still has its mobile-betting license, it will rebrand as theScore Bet, which is based in Ontario.
PENN will also rebrand its retail sportsbooks in two physical casinos, the River City Casino and the Hollywood Casino in St. Louis.
Steve Bittenbender, a gambling analyst for Gambling.com Group, says the move likely won’t change much for consumers.
“It would be like Kohl’s buying Target, and on a certain date, Target is rebranded to something else,” Bittenbender said. “It’s basically a rebrand. A very expensive rebrand.”
Customers who had previously downloaded the ESPN Bet app won’t even have to get a new app — it will be changed to theScore Bet automatically.
The second mover is Underdog Sports, which originally won one of the state’s nine mobile betting licenses. It also announced it would no longer operate a traditional online sportsbook in the state earlier in November.
Instead, it will focus on prediction markets in the same vein as Kalshi and Polymarket that aren’t taxed or heavily regulated by states, according to FOX2Now.
 Last-minute early sign-up promotions, revenue projections

Here are some promotions bettors can still receive by signing up to various apps before the launch:
• DraftKings: Sign up and receive $300 in bonus bets, without a deposit required.
• BetMGM: If your first bet loses, receive bonus bets back equal to up to $1,500.
• FanDuel: Sign up and receive $100 in bonus bets, then up to $400 in bonus bets once you place your first bet of $5 or more.
• Caesar’s Sportsbook: Bet $5, get $150 if you win, plus five more profit boosts on future bets.
These promotions all require you to gamble the bonus bets again, and win, before they can be cashed out. If you miss the pre-launch registration, many sportsbooks will still have promotions, but they will likely be smaller.
Experts will be eyeing this first month of gambling closely to see what the Missouri handle will look like.
“The next six weeks will be fascinating to watch for operators and for customers, just to see how explosive the Missouri sports betting market is in actuality,” Christopher Boan of BetMissouri.com said. “I think it’s important to watch these first couple months, especially, because you’ve got NFL, you’ve got NBA, you’ve got a bunch of stuff that people want to bet on right away.”
BetMissouri projects the state’s overall handle (total bets placed) to be $65,652,274 during the first week, and $262,609,095 during the first month of operations. The total will be key for policymakers who could look to adjust taxes, regulations and more depending on the total handle. Missouri takes 10% of the sportsbooks’ adjusted gross revenue.
Boan expects the raw betting figures to be big, as revenues in other states around Missouri continue to rise.
“There’s a very strong interest in sports betting in the Show-Me State,” Boan said.

(Stadtratte/iStock Images). The Trump administration is dismantling departments, agencies and services that promote the well-being of America and its citizens — doing just the opposite of what the Preamble to the Constitution so clearly states is its purpose.
What has happened to the promise of putting “America First?”
It has been supplanted by tariffs, trying to settle foreign wars, deploying the military in major American cities and seeking retribution by prosecuting perceived political enemies.
The Preamble to the Constitution clearly lays out what putting America First means— what should be the preeminent priorities of the president and his administration, Congress, as well as the other branches of government.
If you haven’t revisited it lately, what better time to do so than now to be reminded and to focus on every word.
“We the people of the Unites States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution of the United States of America.”
Look at what is happening in the federal departments overseeing health, justice, defense and education — core, pivotal departments in preserving, promoting and protecting the general welfare of America and its citizens. We all should be very concerned and feel very vulnerable.
What is the future of this nation? What will be the quality of our life and that of future generations of Americans?
What will happen should the majority of us lose faith and believe that our Constitution and its preamble no longer have value or hold sway?
Good and strong countries decay and die because of the attacks from within. This happens especially when caring citizens no longer believe things will change or think their involvement and intervention will be meaningless.
But left unaddressed and untreated, the rot just creeps and spreads after the initial wounds have been inflicted. Often going ignored and unnoticed, becoming the norm over time.
Is that what is happening as we sit by and watch the Department of Health and Human Services gutted of the policies, research and the qualified committed health professionals with years of expertise?
Is that what is happening as we sit by and watch the Department of Justice become first in line to break all the rules, disregard due process, ignore facts and truths as it carries out vengeful vigilante justice?
Is this what is happening to the Department of Defense (newly named the Department of War) as it gets rid of or loses many of the most experienced and battle-ready officers among its corps.
Maybe the best example of this problem is the Department of Education, which we have counted on to guide and support equal opportunities for all of our children to receive a quality education by establishing, implementing and overseeing the best standards and practices.
Will our children receive a better education when policies and procedures are left solely up to individual states?
Even before the current effort to get rid of the Department of Education, many states including Missouri, are promoting or adopting measures that are not in the best educational interests of all its children. In addition to underfunding public schools and teacher salaries, taxpayers dollars are being used to support tuition or some form of financial support for private schools.
Underpaying teachers and unjustifiably banning books have become commonplace.
Look at all the other symptoms of decay and erosion — the fraying around the edges — occurring that are not promoting the general welfare.
Why is the average American struggling to make ends meet, while the wealthy and powerful become even more powerful and wealthier through tax breaks and additional business opportunities?
What is the purpose of putting Medicaid and Medicare benefits and services at risk for those Americans who qualify to receive them? Yes, the ineligible recipients and any waste should be gotten rid of. However, it does not mean that the qualified should be denied their legitimate benefits.
The dismantling and redesigning of departments, agencies and services are destroying the very purpose and tenements the Preamble outlines, and the Constitution directs how they are to be carried out.
But is the Preamble to the Constitution, and the Constitution itself, becoming little more than lofty words in a historical founding document that many of us read long ago, or maybe not at all?
It will not become alive and implement itself.
It will not hold itself accountable.
“Let not any one pacify his conscience by the delusion that he can do no harm if he takes no part, and forms no opinion. Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing. He is not a good man who, without a protest, allows wrong to be committed in his name, and with the means which he helps to supply, because he will not trouble himself to use his mind on the subject.”
Some version of this quote from John Stuart Mills, the 19th century English philosopher, has been used during dark and defining times. It is worth consideration and taking to heart for the times we are in.
We cannot be pacified with not speaking up, fighting for, and insisting that our Constitution and all its meaning be upheld.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)A rule to protect Wisconsin’s cleanest waterways from being harmed was finalized last week over the objections of Republican legislators and allied lobbying groups. 
The rule highlights the ongoing dispute between the Legislature and the administration of Gov. Tony Evers over the level of oversight legislators are allowed to have over the administrative rulemaking process. Earlier this year, the state Supreme Court issued a ruling that curtailed the ability of the Legislature to kill administrative rules. 
The new rule, which was published in the state’s administrative register Nov. 24 and is set to go into effect July 1, is the result of a decade of wrangling. 
In 2015, the U.S. EPA updated the Clean Water Act’s antidegradation regulations — which guide how states are required to protect high quality lakes and rivers from pollution. 
Dozens of creeks, rivers and lakes are classified as outstanding resource waters and exceptional resource waters under Wisconsin’s administrative code and will be protected as “high quality waters” under the new rule. Additionally, a body of water can be considered a high quality water if it has contaminant levels that are better than an established statewide standard. 
“This means that a waterbody can be high quality for one or more parameters, even if it is impaired for a different parameter,” Laura Dietrich, manager of the Department of Natural Resources’ water evaluation section, said in an email. “For example, a waterbody may be impaired for phosphorus, but chloride levels are better than the chloride water quality criterion. The waterbody would be considered high quality for the purposes of considering new or increased discharges of chloride, but would not be high quality for phosphorus.” 
Under the new rule, the DNR will be required to conduct a review before regulated entities are allowed to discharge new or increased levels of contaminants into the water body. Discharges may be allowed if found to be necessary through a “social or economic analysis.”
The rule’s finalization is the end of a process that began in 2023 and has included multiple public hearings and the input of several legislative committees. 
Last month, the Assembly committee on the environment voted 4-2 to request modifications to the rule, but the DNR and the Evers administration moved forward with finalizing the rule anyway. 
That action has angered Republicans who want more say in the process. 
“Representative government has been taken away and we now have rule by king,” Rep. Joy Goeben (R-Hobart) said in a statement. “We don’t want a king and the current path forward is dangerous.”
Lobbying groups have also complained about the rule’s finalization. 
Scott Manley, a lobbyist for Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the state’s largest business group, told Wisconsin Public Radio that the rule going into effect is “terrible from a representative government standpoint.” 
Erik Kanter, government relations director with Clean Wisconsin, told the Wisconsin Examiner that he thinks the rule represents the DNR finding a solid compromise between environmental and business concerns and that WMC was involved in the entire process through an advisory committee. 
“DNR engaged the stakeholder group regularly over the 30-month process it took to put the rule together at the DNR, and so WMC, along the way, had all the opportunity, and certainly took the opportunity, to make their thoughts [known] on how to put this rule together,” Kanter said. “It almost feels like it was never going to be enough for WMC.” 
Kanter also said that because the rule aligns the state with the EPA regulations, the state doesn’t have a choice if it wants to retain regulatory authority over its own water. 
“Wisconsin has to do this. We have to update our own rules to comply with federal changes to the Clean Water Act,” he said. “There’s no two ways about it if we want to maintain our delegation authority and have state regulators in charge of administering the Clean Water Act. It’s something we have to do.”
The alternative would be for the federal EPA to administer the act in Wisconsin, he said. 
“I think a lot of folks in the business community wouldn’t want EPA and the federal government breathing down their neck,” Kanter said. “And so this delegated authority situation is, I think, better for everybody.”

(Photo by Richard Ross via Getty Images)The 2025-26 Educator Supply and Demand Report by the Center for Educator Recruitment, Retention and Advancement represents an exciting step toward providing every South Carolina student with access to the highest quality education.
Its release comes only a few weeks after the South Carolina Department of Education reported record improvements on school report cards.
The double dose of good news in K-12 education is far from coincidence. Instead, it affirms South Carolina students excel when they are provided with the resources they need, and no resource is more important than staffing every classroom with a highly qualified educator.
For the first time this decade, the number of vacant educator positions to start the school year has declined for two consecutive years, with the 706 reported vacancies this year representing a 56% decline from the record high vacancies reported in 2023.
This year’s number of vacancies is also more than 300 fewer than last year, a figure especially notable as the data this year includes participation from three additional school districts not included in last year’s report.
The lower vacancy number is also not a result of a reduction in overall teaching positions, with the report showing the second-highest number of total employed positions this decade.
Improving education in SC requires supporting teachers and elevating good leaders

The reduction in vacancies demonstrates how sustained policy efforts can make a meaningful positive impact on teacher supply.
The downward trend is almost certainly correlated with the continued upward trend in educator salaries, with this year’s starting statewide minimum teacher salary of $48,500 representing a 35% increase compared to 2020.
Numerous districts across the state have built on the record investments made by the General Assembly, led by Charleston County increasing starting pay to nearly $65,000.
In recent years, the General Assembly has also passed several significant policies to improve educator working conditions, starting with providing daily unencumbered time and paid parental leave to educators earlier this decade and culminating in the governor signing the Educator Assistance Act into law in May 2025.
If implemented successfully by districts, these policies will continue to enhance efforts to recruit and retain educators.
However, even the good news in the Supply and Demand Report does not offset the fact that educator vacancy rates still remain too high in South Carolina.
While this year’s reduced number is encouraging, that trend provides limited solace or benefit to the tens of thousands of students experiencing diminished opportunities due to hundreds of classrooms lacking a certified teacher.
The impact of stubbornly persistent educator shortages is especially acute for students entitled to additional academic support through an individualized education plan (IEP), as more than 25% of the vacant classroom teaching positions statewide are in special education.
Additionally, the vacancy rate remains far too high in essential education service provider positions such as psychologists and speech language pathologists.
Shortages in these areas exist nationally, meaning South Carolina is in a race to secure teaching talent.
As a result, the optimism provided by this year’s Supply and Demand report should be matched or exceeded by a sense of urgency to make South Carolina the most attractive place for educators to work in the Southeast.
Such an effort requires comprehensive efforts by state and local leaders.
At the state level, the General Assembly must achieve Gov. McMaster’s long-standing goal of ensuring every teacher in the state is paid no less than $50,000.
The General Assembly should also start the work of creating “career ladder” compensation pathways, a policy recommended by the 2023 Teacher Recruitment and Retention Task Force based on promising results for similar programs in states like Texas and North Carolina.
Improved working conditions for educators may be even more important than compensation in order to fully eliminate educator shortages.
Efforts in this area must start with addressing the rise in persistently disruptive and dangerous student behaviors that undermine learning and too often result in physical harm to both educators and students.
Regardless of the salary offered, an educator that is consistently being struck at work is unlikely to persist in the profession, yet nearly one quarter of the members of Palmetto State Teachers Association report that a student referred to administrators for a violent behavior is returned to the classroom on the same day.
Local districts also have important roles to play in improving educator working conditions, starting with ensuring that statewide policies like the Educator Assistance Act, unencumbered time requirements, and class size caps are implemented with fidelity.
School leaders should also carefully evaluate what is necessary and essential work for teachers in order to eliminate tasks beyond the scope of an individual’s employment contract, activities that thousands of educators across the state are routinely required to complete without any compensation for their work.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/teachers-desk-e1732570434859-1024x764.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 06:56:26.373488

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Roughly one month after State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst was cited for “public indecency” over an alleged groping incident, state lawmakers are still undecided on how the Nebraska Legislature ought to respond.
The Unicameral’s Executive Board, which is in charge of handling disciplinary procedures within the Legislature, has met at least once in a closed session to discuss the situation, but it is unclear whether anything was decided.
The chair of the Executive Board, State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, told the Examiner he was considering scheduling another board meeting during Thanksgiving week to discuss McKeon, but officials said no meetings were scheduled.

McKeon was issued a misdemeanor citation by Nebraska State Patrol in late October after investigating an allegation by a legislative staffer attending an end-of-session party this spring. The Patrol received a report in early September that McKeon allegedly “made inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” Patrol spokesman Cody Thomas said.
Kathleen Neary, the attorney representing the woman making the allegation, said that since the news broke “a surprising number” of people working inside or associated with the Legislature have reached out to offer their support.
“While I have handled many, many cases of sexual harassment over the years, I am truly shocked at the outpouring of support for my client,” Neary said in an email.
The Examiner is aware of the alleged victim’s name but is not publishing it because it is the policy of States Newsroom and the Examiner not to identify people who say they have been abused unless they wish to talk publicly.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
McKeon has made several statements about the incident since the citation was issued, including a July 28 letter he sent to the staffer, and a broader statement through his attorney Perry Pirsch. In those statements, McKeon acknowledged the incident occurred but denied the woman’s allegations, describing the incident as a “light-hearted exchange” that he argued did not qualify as public indecency.
Pirsch said McKeon “made a single remark — a joke — to a staff member about her planned trip and hoping she and her husband would receive a ‘Hawaiian lei,’ or words to that effect, and he then patted her on the back.”
“It was meant in jest, and nothing about his action was in any way sexually charged or lewd, just a bad pun,” Pirsch said in the statement.
McKeon is a registered Republican who was elected to the officially nonpartisan Legislature in 2024, replacing former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul. McKeon’s biographical page on the Legislature’s website highlights that he has been married for 30 years and has four children.
Gov. Jim Pillen and other state officials have called for McKeon’s resignation, but McKeon has said he will not resign.
State Sen. Teresa Ibach of Sumner, vice chair of the Executive Board, confirmed in October that members of the committee were looking into the situation separately from the criminal investigation but said the group hadn’t yet reached a conclusion.
It is unclear whether the Executive Board has decided anything with regard to McKeon. Clerk of the Legislature Brandon Metzler said his office had received no recommended actions from the board as of Nov. 24.
Typically, legislative committees are not allowed to vote in private sessions, but Metzler said some “administrative” exceptions might apply to the Executive Board. Measures regarding legislative processes — such as a recommendation for censure or a formal reprimand — must happen through a public vote, but Metzler said Hansen as chair could initiate some administrative actions on his own.
Metzler said his office would be notified of any formal meetings, including closed sessions, but that wouldn’t keep the board from holding an informal meeting.
State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams, a member of the Executive Board, said board members have been advised by legal counsel to be cautious in their public statements about the situation. This is because they don’t want to inadvertently do something that could impede the Patrol’s ongoing investigation, Dorn said.
McKeon is expected in Lancaster County Court Dec. 10, authorities said.

Easter enrolled in a long-term care nursing program at an Oklahoma CareerTech center while attending an Oklahoma City-area high school with the hope of eventually earning a bachelor’s degree in nursing. As the daughter of a single mother, the 19-year-old said she was always worried about the cost of education.

“I was really scared to take out student loans after I graduated, and with this it has all been so fine,” she said. “They’re so financially supportive here. I’ve never taken out a loan or had any financial strain and I instantly got a job. I started working at Bethany Children’s Hospital as a senior in high school and now I’m becoming a (licensed practical nurse) for free. … To me, that stability was worth more than anything.”
As Oklahoma employers struggle with shortages of certified nursing assistants – mirroring a national trend – Easter is one of hundreds of high school students that have completed an Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education program aimed at filling that gap. Through the program, students earn nursing certifications that can lead to employment opportunities or serve as a bridge to other health care professions after they graduate. 
Certified nursing assistants often perform tasks at a patient’s bedside such as helping with bathing, walking from room to room and taking vitals. But experts say the ongoing national shortage, due in part to recruiting struggles, is jeopardizing the quality of care patients receive. 
To help bridge the gap, all 29 of CareerTech’s technology center districts, and most of their 67 campuses, offer certified nurse assistant training in the form of both full-time high school and adult programs as well as short-term, workforce and economic development programs, said Lara Morris, the agency’s program manager for health and science education. The program costs about $114.8 million a year to operate and is funded by federal and state dollars.

High school students, who pay no tuition, spend half days at their local technology centers for the programs. After completion, some students, like Easter, are able to take advantage of “bridge” programs to earn the next level of nursing certification through CareerTech programming.
Addressing a nationwide nursing shortage 
Emily Coppock, the vice president of clinical excellence at the Oklahoma Hospital Association, said high turnover and fear of violence against health care workers can be a deterrent to working in the field. 
Early education is crucial to recruitment and retention, she said. 
A 2024 workforce survey report from the Oklahoma Hospital Association revealed that 13.1% of unlicensed nursing staff positions are vacant, and there is a 52% turnover rate. The turnover rate is so high because many of these people pursue a higher level of nursing or a different health care field, Coppock said. 
“Physically, we just don’t have the people to fill those gaps that are going to be left by baby boomers retiring,” she said. 
Steven Buck, president and CEO of Care Providers Oklahoma, said certified nursing assistants are the “backbone” of care in long-term care facilities, but retaining them can be a struggle. The organization represents and advocates for residents and employees of those facilities.
“They are the individuals who are most engaged with residents, making sure that their quality of life is addressed, providing care, providing service,” he said. “And they do this diligently, and do it across the state, and do it in a very heroic manner.”
Part of the difficulty in retaining certified nursing assistants is pay because the long-term care industry has to compete with retailers and fast food chains, Buck said. Increasing this pay is something Buck said his group is advocating for at the Capitol.

Nursing assistants, on average, make just over $16 per hour in the state of Oklahoma, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Oklahoma’s home health and personal care aides make around $13 per hour, licensed practical nurses make $26 per hour and registered nurses make about $41 an hour. 
In general, most of these nursing assistants are employed in long-term care or home health providers and they are vital to the industry, Buck said. 
Some of Oklahoma’s major hospital systems, including Mercy, Integris and University of Oklahoma Health, said programs like CareerTech’s that catch students in high school and provide hands-on, clinical experience are helpful to fill employment gaps. 
Buck said the state is “on the cusp of something commonly referred to as the silver tsunami.” 
“There are going to be just, from generational cycles, a tremendous number of people emerging into that era of life where they will need enhanced care,” he said. “And at the same time, there are going to be fewer caregivers available. So I applaud CareerTech for investing the time and energy to recruit these CNAs. We desperately need them, and we need them to stay committed to the field.”
Skills learned now will lead to jobs down the road 
Jackson Hukill, 18, attends a Francis Tuttle technology center and is working toward his certified nursing assistant certification. He hopes to eventually become an anesthesiologist.

In his classes, Hukill said he’s learning skills such as CPR, medical terminology, proper hygiene and use of personal protective equipment.
“I personally love being hands on, and I know a lot of people love being hands on,” he said. “It helps a lot of people learn and it definitely does give us kind of a step up from what I think most health classes or whatever you would have in high school, or even some undergrad, college stuff isn’t as hands-on.”
A total of 1,446 students graduated from the program in the 2023-24 school year, according to an agency spokesperson. Data from the most recent school year was not available. 
Nearly 350 of these students reported they were employed in a job related to the program one year after completion, according to data provided by CareerTech. Another 1,030 had opted to continue their education, whether at CareerTech or elsewhere. 
Brent Haken, director of Oklahoma CareerTech, said the agency determines what programs are offered based on need throughout the state, not “wants.” Because of this, health care and manufacturing jobs have become the agency’s priority for workforce training programs.
“These are sophisticated programs, and the curriculums are based on feedback from the actual industry that has input,” he said. “The curriculum that we provide to students is customized to meet the needs of the industry.”
High school students do not pay tuition for the CareerTech programs offered in their district, so local property taxes offset the costs, an agency spokesperson said. Most technology centers generally receive 30% of its funding from state and federal dollars, with the rest being voter-approved property taxes.

Patience Melchor, 18, a student at Indianola High School taking classes at the Kiamichi Technology Center in McAlester, said she’s already using the nursing assistant certification she earned at a long-term care facility in her area.
Melchor wants to become a registered nurse and specialize in labor and delivery, but she said she isn’t sure if she’ll go straight to college or enroll in another CareerTech program first. 
“Every Wednesday we have a skills day, so we wear our scrubs and come into the lab and put our skills to test on the mannequins, or even sometimes each other,” she said. “We learned how to do bed baths on the mannequins, and we practice blood pressure and vital signs on each other and stuff like that. Then we go to clinicals towards the end of the year and those are really fun because you actually get to go to a clinic or a nursing home, and it was really fun to actually get to work on a real person.”

An all-hands-on-deck effort, tens of millions in funding and a breakthrough herbicide are slowing but not halting a destructive force steadily enveloping the best sagebrush left on Earth.
The post Inside Wyoming’s fight against cheatgrass, the ‘most existential, sweeping threat’ to western ecosystems appeared first on WyoFile .","POWDER RIVER BASIN—Brian Mealor scanned the prairie east of Buffalo, but his mind drifted west to a haunting scene in northern Nevada. 
In the burn scar of the Roosters Comb Fire, a single unwelcomed species had taken over, choking out all competitors. Mealor saw few native grasses or shrubs, scarcely a wildflower. 
Not even other weeds.
“Literally everything you see is cheatgrass,” Mealor recalled of his June tour of the scar. “I just stood there, depressed.”

Mealor already knew plenty about the Eurasian species’ capacity to decimate North American ecosystems since he leads the University of Wyoming’s Institute for Managing Annual Grasses Invading Natural Ecosystems. But he was still shocked walking through the endless cheatgrass monoculture taking over the 220,000 once-charred acres northwest of Elko. 
The same noxious species, he knew, is steadily spreading in Wyoming.
The ecological scourge made Silver State officials so desperate that they were planting another nonnative, forage kochia, because it competes with less nutritious cheatgrass and offers some nourishment for native wildlife, like mule deer. 
“They’ll just die, because there’s nothing there,” Mealor said. “That’s why we have to do stuff. Because we could turn into that.”

Scientists, rangeland managers and state and county officials are doing everything in their power to prevent Wyoming from becoming another landscape lost to cheatgrass. There’s a powerful new herbicide that’s helping. And funds enabling the spraying of hundreds of thousands of acres are being secured and raised. Yet, Wyoming is still losing its cheatgrass fight, and ultimately far more resources are needed to turn it around.
“Let’s not kid ourselves,” said Bob Budd, executive director of the Wyoming Wildlife and Natural Resource Trust. “The magnitude of the need is utterly staggering. We’re talking hundreds of millions of dollars over the next decade. That’s daunting.”
Budd voiced that warning Tuesday while addressing a statewide group that focuses on bighorn sheep, which depend on seasonal ranges being invaded by cheatgrass. A recent study co-authored by Mealor underscores the need to act soon to protect Wyoming’s wildlife. UW researchers concluded that cheatgrass, which is only edible in spring, could cost northeast Wyoming’s already struggling mule deer half their current habitat in the next couple of decades.
Eighteen months ago, green sagebrush plants would have dominated this vista all the way to the horizon in the Powder River Basin. Today, because of the House Draw Fire, it’s a golden prairie — the lighter-hued portions are dominated by invasive cheatgrass and Japanese brome. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)
On Nov. 6, the Sheridan-based professor joined fellow academics, biologists and volunteers on a field trip to a mixed-grass prairie. Like the Nevada burn scar, this was a Wyoming landscape on the mend from wildfire. In fact, it wasn’t a grassland until last year. 
Before Aug. 21, 2024, the ground where they stood had been considered the best of what’s left of northeast Wyoming’s sagebrush biome. 
Transformation
A lightning storm that sparked a conflagration abruptly ended that era. Over the course of two days, the House Draw Fire tore a 10-mile-wide, almost 60-mile-long gash into the landscape, inflicting over $25 million in damage. In a fiery blink, the native plant community mostly disappeared. 
Once-prized sagebrush within roughly 100,000 acres of the burn area is basically gone, a worrisome loss of habitat for the region’s already struggling sage grouse. What grew back isn’t a monoculture, like in Nevada. Native species are easily found. But portions of the Powder River Basin’s rolling hills are now dominated by big densities of cheatgrass and Japanese brome, another invasive annual grass. Without mature sagebrush shrubs to compete with, there’s reason to believe the invaders, which flourish with fire, will expand their grip. 
“It’s not like you have a fire and all of a sudden you’re just completely covered with cheatgrass,” Mealor said. “There’s a lag.”

The Johnson County Natural Habitat Restoration Team is throwing everything it can at the fire scar to try to prevent invasive grasses from taking over. Armed with $12 million in state funds, crews will aerially spray some 120,000 acres with a cheatgrass-killing herbicide. Aerial sagebrush seeding is also underway on 3,000 acres of burned-up sage grouse nesting habitat. And there are even funded plans to build hundreds of simple erosion-controlling Zeedyk structures to protect the wet meadows within the fire scar. 
Yet, on a broader scale, Mealor is a realist about the immense challenge of keeping cheatgrass and its noxious counterparts at bay in Wyoming, let alone enabling sagebrush to stage a comeback — a costly, complicated feat. 
“If we were talking about a 25,000-acre fire here and there,” Mealor said, “it would be a little different.” 
About a half-million acres of northeastern Wyoming burned in 2024, the state’s second-largest fire year in modern history. Wyoming lawmakers agreed to carve out $49 million for wildfire recovery grants statewide, less than half of Gov. Mark Gordon’s requested amount. Optimistically, Mealor said, the awarded sum might be enough to treat a million acres. That sounds significant — it’s half the acreage of Yellowstone. But cheatgrass is spreading just about everywhere in a state that spans 62 million acres.

“If you think about it from a statewide level, it’s not a lot,” Mealor said of the funding. “That’s not an attack. I’m not downplaying the importance of the money that was set aside by the Legislature for this. It’s a lot of money. But it’s also not enough.” 
The governor, who’s a rancher by trade, has voiced the same concern. Pushing for $20 million in cheatgrass spraying funds during the Legislature’s 2024 budget-making process, Gordon acknowledged Wyoming is “losing the battle” against invasive annual grasses. Lawmakers ultimately agreed to $9 million, less than half the requested amount, according to the budget. 
‘Best of the best’
The incursions that cheatgrass, Japanese brome and fellow invasives medusahead and ventenata are making into Wyoming rangelands are significant because of what’s at stake. The Equality State is the cornerstone of what remains of the sagebrush-steppe biome, a 13-state ecosystem vanishing at a rate of 1 million-plus acres per year.  
“Half of the best of the best is in Wyoming,” said Corinna Riginos, who directs the Wyoming science program for The Nature Conservancy. 

In 2020, the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies completed a conservation plan to proactively restore the United States’ declining sagebrush habitat.

The Lander-based scientist is spearheading a Camp Monaco Prize-winning project that seeks to safeguard the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem from cheatgrass. The flanks of the ecosystem, such as the Golden Triangle, southwest of the Wind River Range, contain some of the most expansive unbroken tracts of sagebrush remaining on Earth. Distribution maps show that almost all of those areas are in Wyoming. It’s no coincidence that the same places also host remarkable biological phenomena, like the world’s largest sage grouse lek and longest mule deer migration. 
Riginos’ research is focused on defensive measures to catch and kill cheatgrass early on, when it exists at low levels. Keeping the invasion out of core tracts of sagebrush, she said, is a more efficient use of funds than trying to shift heavily contaminated landscapes back to what they used to be. 
“Maybe we live with what they are, we cope with it, rather than trying to recover from it,” Riginos said of cheatgrass-dominated areas. 
Cheatgrass grows where reddish stripes appear on the hillsides leading up to Washakie Reservoir in June 2024. The green stripes are where an herbicide, Indaziflam, was experimentally applied. Rangeland managers have since scaled up the effort, funding 16,000 acres of cheatgrass removal in the Washakie Park area. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)
Within Wyoming, invasive grass experts don’t have to go far from the world’s most unsullied sagebrush stands to find heavily infested landscapes. In June 2024, Riginos toured cheatgrass treatments in the Wind River Indian Reservation’s Washakie Park area. Although they stood about 40 straight-line miles from the Golden Triangle, scientists, wildlife managers and weed experts on the tour were surrounded by hillsides purple-hued from cheatgrass. 
“You have to respect it, as an organism,” Riginos said. “The adaptability and just kind of sheer ability to get a toehold and take over is pretty remarkable.”
Cheatgrass gets its name from its ability to “cheat” surrounding vegetation out of moisture and nutrients. Its mechanism for success is essentially a head start. It germinates in the fall and starts growing in cold temperatures. Then it overwinters, matures, throws off prolific amounts of seeds and dies by midsummer when native grasses and forbs are much earlier in their life cycle.

On top of the advantageous life cycle, the West’s ever-increasing, climate-driven wildfires help cheatgrass flourish. When a cheatgrass-infested area burns and becomes more cheatgrass dominant, it’s more prone to burn again, creating a vicious feedback loop. 
Giving cheatgrass yet another advantage, research has shown the plant in North America adapts well to different locales. That trait enables it to flourish in a wide range of temperatures and moisture conditions across the West, Riginos said.
“I feel that this is the most existential, sweeping threat to our western ecosystems.” Corinna riginos
“I don’t want to see the West become a wasteland of cheatgrass, I really don’t,” she said. “I feel that this is the most existential, sweeping threat to our western ecosystems. It really concerns me.” 
Closing in
All those traits have enabled an impressive, though foreboding, expansion. Since its introduction from Europe in the 1800s, cheatgrass has spread to all 50 states and parts of Canada and Mexico. There are signs it’s not slowing down. Rangeland ecologists have detected an eightfold increase in cheatgrass across the Great Basin since the 1990s, according to the National Wildlife Federation. 
Simultaneously, sagebrush-dominated landscapes have sustained a decline. A 2022 U.S. Geological Survey report found that an average of 1.3 million acres are being lost or degraded every year. That’s an area larger than Rhode Island.
Although the spread of Wyoming cheatgrass hasn’t been as overwhelming as in lower-elevation, drier western states, the invasion has, and continues to be, successful. A whitepaper distributed by the Wyoming Outdoor Council in the state Capitol during the 2024 funding fight reported that invasive annual grasses already affect 26% of the Equality State’s landmass, which pencils out to over 16 million acres.

Historically, Wyoming land managers believed that much of the nation’s least-populated state was too high and too cold for cheatgrass to gain much ground. But the climate has tilted in its favor, according to Jeanne Chambers, an emeritus U.S. Forest Service research ecologist who has studied cheatgrass for decades.
“Cooler temperatures, especially those cold nighttime temperatures, used to keep cheatgrass at bay,” Chambers said. “But now that things are warming up and people and livestock and animals are all over the place, the propagules — the seeds — are getting everywhere.” 
As a result, slightly lower-elevation reaches of Wyoming, like the Bighorn Basin, are seeing more and more cheatgrass, she said. The same goes for where the salt desert transitions into sagebrush in the state’s southwestern corner.   
“Those areas are pretty vulnerable,” Chambers said.

Wyoming specialists in those communities corroborate the claims.
“Cheatgrass is moving into our county, primarily on the south end — but it’s not exclusive to the south end,” Sweetwater County Weed and Pest Supervisor Dan Madson said. “There are hot spots throughout the county invading mule deer, antelope and elk habitats, as well as sage grouse core areas.” 
Some of the encroachments are well north into the Green River Basin and Red Desert, noted sagebrush strongholds. North of Rock Springs, north of Superior and in the Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge are all places being actively invaded, Madson said.  
Sweetwater County is scaling up its response, Madson said. The county is spending about $750,000 to spray nearly 12,000 acres of cheatgrass this year and plans to treat more like 15,000 acres in 2026. 
But money is a limiting factor. Wyoming landscapes have been the recipient of many millions of federal dollars, including from the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which have complemented the state’s contributions.

Still, the pace of infestation statewide and in Sweetwater County far exceeds the total resources available. 
“We could easily, easily triple that [15,000 acres] in a year,” Madson said, “and still have enough to do for the rest of my career.”
Funding issues aren’t only due to federal government turmoil. One potential pot of $11 million that would have been directed toward spraying evaporated when the Wyoming Senate opted to forgo a supplemental budget. 
“That money got lost,” said Budd, at the Wyoming Wildlife and Natural Resource Trust. “It actually hurt some parts of the state that were doing a very good proactive job, managing to keep cheatgrass down.”
‘Defending the core’
The upper Green River Basin is one example of a landscape where cheatgrass advances have been reversed. Its remoteness, harsh climate and high elevation helped, but those factors alone didn’t prevent a slow incursion of the virulent vegetation early in the century. By 2014, for example, hues of red and purple — hallmarks of cheatgrass — were painting the ridges rising over Boulder Lake. 
The Sublette County Weed and Pest District fought the invasion with repeated treatments. In 2018 alone, some 30,000 acres of the western front of the Winds were aerially sprayed. It worked. 
By the summer 2020, no cheatgrass was being detected at Boulder Lake, once a hotspot, District Supervisor Julie Kraft said. Nowadays, she said, no major problem areas remain in Sublette County.
In August 2019, a recreational shooter hit an exploding target and sparked the Tannerite Fire, which ripped across the pictured ridge on the north end of Boulder Lake. Afterwards, cheatgrass that was already in the area grew in thick where the sagebrush once stood, but the mountainside was subsequently treated and today the invasive grass occurs only in trace levels. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)
Kraft even felt “good” about the future of her cheatgrass fight, expressing uncommon optimism for those grappling with an organism overtaking so many places. 
“A couple of years ago, I might not have said the same thing,” Kraft said. “But with this new tool, and particularly because of the influx of money that came [during] the [Biden] administration, it allowed us to do so much more.” 
That new tool is an herbicide, Indaziflam. It’s a product, also known by its trade name, Rejuvra, that provides far more enduring protection against cheatgrass than any previous chemical treatment. It works by attacking the seedbank and shallow root structure of cheatgrass, while not infiltrating the soil deep enough to kill perennial native grasses and plants like sagebrush. 
“It depletes it down until there won’t be a seedbank of cheatgrass anymore,” Kraft said. “We’ve seen that on our sites. Year one, you can go out and grab handfuls of cheatgrass seed off the top of the soil. Year two, you can’t find those handfuls anymore. By year three, you can’t dig [cheatgrass seeds] out of the bottoms of sagebrush.”
Sublette County, a stronghold of the sagebrush biome, has fared better than other parts of Wyoming at keeping cheatgrass at bay. Still, patches can be found here or there, like this pocket overlooking Half Moon Lake in March 2025. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)
The June 2024 outing that drew Riginos, the Nature Conservancy scientist, to Washakie Park along the east slope of the Winds included a stop at an experimental Indaziflam treatment plot. 
Although a mix of the herbicide had been misted over strips of cheatgrass nearly four years earlier, its effect remained obvious and unmistakable. Curing, purple drooping brome blanketed untreated strips, and native green grasses filled the niches between. 
“It’s holding still,” said Aaron Foster, Fremont County’s weed and pest supervisor, who led the cheatgrass treatment tour on the reservation. “It’s been holding now for four growing seasons. Pretty impressive.”  
Indaziflam is a relative newcomer to Wyoming’s cheatgrass-killing battle. The Environmental Protection Agency didn’t clear it for use on rangelands until 2020. Some federal authorizations came even more recently, with the Bureau of Land Management approving its use in July 2024, after years of urging from western states including Wyoming. 
“With this approval, Indaziflam will be eligible for application on 18 million acres of BLM land in Wyoming,” Gordon said in a press release, noting the policy change would have been “even more welcome” if BLM had made the announcement before states and counties were planning their spraying season.  
Judicious spraying
Out of necessity, Wyoming’s weed and pest districts and federal land managers are extremely strategic about where to put Indaziflam. It’s notoriously costly. Typically, time in the air is the biggest expense in aerial weed spraying work. But that’s not the case with the Envu-produced chemical. At Washakie Park, Foster reported paying $42-$43 per acre in product alone, adding up to about triple the cost of the helicopter. 
Kraft, in Sublette County, didn’t mince words about why Rejuvra’s so pricey. 
“It was a specialty herbicide used on specialty crops — almonds, I believe,” Kraft said. “They found out it worked on cheatgrass and now they have this western monopoly on this herbicide that works great. It’s expensive, and it goes up every year.” 
A Wyoming sales representative for Envu stood behind its breakthrough chemical’s high per-ounce cost. Compared to competing herbicides that need to be sprayed more often, in the long term Rejuvra is a bargain, David Collins said. 
“It’s actually the cheapest product to utilize,” he said. “You’re applying it once instead of every year or every other year, and you’re also saving on application cost.”

With limited resources, Fremont County’s spraying plan is to focus on swaths of the landscape that haven’t been extensively invaded: the Absaroka and Winds foothills toward Dubois and the Red Desert are two examples. But the “core problem area” — the cheatgrass-infested county center, which has lots of human disturbance — is considered a much lower priority, Foster said.  
“I think you have to kind of accept that we’re going to have cheatgrass forever.”Aaron foster
“I think you have to kind of accept that we’re going to have cheatgrass forever,” he said. “And areas like that are going to be impacted by it most severely forever, too.” 
Out where the House Draw Fire burned, the Johnson County restoration team is planning to spend big on Indaziflam — spraying burned areas that are now grasslands and unburned sagebrush to the tune of $9.3 million, consuming more than three-quarters of its state grant.    
Ultimately, those tending the fire’s scar opted not to spray immediately. Instead, they took a breath, collected data on where cheatgrass and Japanese brome now dominate and where native vegetation grew back.

“If we were to spray in the black, without knowing that any of the perennial vegetation was going to survive, it could have just been bare ground for four or five years,” said Jaycie Arndt, a University of Wyoming assistant research scientist. 
Now, more than a year after the House Draw Fire burned, its scar also hosts big concentrations of some native grasses, too. Western wheatgrass and blue grama were two species that also surrounded the weed scientists and landowners on their recent tour. 
Healthy native grasses can be one of the best defenses against cheatgrass.
“Sometimes the focus needs to be more on maintaining and increasing our perennial grasses and forbs as competitors,” said Chambers, the longtime Forest Service researcher. Cheatgrass, she added, is “naturalized” into a lot of western landscapes and is “always going to be there on one level or another.” Retaining native vegetation helps maintain resiliency to the attack.

The House Draw Fire recovery plan also calls for facilitating the return of the ever-depleting sagebrush biome. Ultimately, the state sunk $2.5 million into aerial sagebrush seeding — a technique that’s never been used in Wyoming. 
“This whole thing was an experiment,” said Todd Caltrider, a terrestrial habitat biologist with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “I looked for literature on aerial seeding for sagebrush in the Northern Great Plains, and there wasn’t any.” 
Caltrider spoke from a private land monitoring plot southeast of Buffalo, where sagebrush seedlings, reaching a few inches skyward, could be seen sprouting from the soil. They were among the cherished few. Results were worse than anticipated, with seedlings growing back at an average rate of one plant per acre.

Although land and wildlife managers will attempt to restore burned reaches of the sagebrush biome in the Powder River Basin, they’ll face a long road. After the first year of aerial seeding, monitoring discovered only about one seedling per acre on a landscape that could become dominated by invasive grasses. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)
Even without cheatgrass to compete with, sagebrush comes back painstakingly slow. Individual plants can take decades to mature. But after a wildfire, the ecosystem evolved to recover even more slowly than that: Wyoming big sagebrush takes as long as 200 to 350 years to return to dense stands of mature plants, research has found. 
“If that’s the case, of course, we’re not seeing any [recovery],” Mealor said. 
The UW weed scientist’s feet lingered in the burn scar of what was once the Powder River Basin’s best sagebrush. Because of the House Draw Fire, it might functionally be a grassland for the rest of his life. The hope, of course, is that it won’t be a sea of cheatgrass.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)A big thumb’s up to state Rep. Molly Jenkins, the first Republican lawmaker to have the courage to publicly proclaim that the bizarre shenanigans of Oklahoma’s Board on Legislative Compensation stink to high heaven.
The Coyle lawmaker waded into the fray last week, challenging the elected leaders of her own party while in the process backing Attorney Gentner Drummond into a corner.
She’s demanding that Drummond issue an opinion on whether the nine-voting member board violated the state Open Meeting Act by bucking tradition and conducting business behind closed doors to discuss pay for lawmakers elected in November 2026.
Get out the popcorn. 
We’re all about to see if Drummond again sides with the good ol’ boy system that has ruthlessly proven over the past few weeks that they’re willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want, consequences be damned. Or we’ll see if the Republican interprets the law in such a way that restores public trust in how our government functions and upholds the level of transparency all Oklahomans should expect from governing bodies.
Because this soap opera that’s been playing out since October raises questions about the ethics of legislative leaders that control the agenda in the Capitol. 
Oklahoma lawmakers have given the governor, House Speaker, and Senate President Pro Tem, the power to appoint this board, which meets on the third Tuesday in October in odd-numbered years, to set the salary of future lawmakers. 
As someone who has sat through these board meetings over the years, let me tell you, they’re  normally a dull group. They watch a presentation that compares legislative pay to that of other states in the region. They discuss it publicly – sometimes in excruciating detail – to make sure they understand, and then vote. 
One year, the board, annoyed at lawmakers’ incompetence, cut their pay. But for the most part these are uneventful affairs.
But this year, setting legislative pay has been a bad melodrama. 
It turns out House Speaker Kyle Hilbert appointed a lobbyist to serve on the board — in clear violation of state law. But nobody, including apparently the Attorney General’s Office, which is supposed to ensure this board follows the law, noticed it the first two times they met.
The fact that James Leewright was a lobbyist and ineligible to serve mysteriously came to light after the board twice refused to increase legislative pay. Unsurprisingly, Leewright had been a lead proponent of pay hikes for the people he lobbies.
Under state law, this board can’t meet after the third Tuesday in November. The Friday before the deadline, Hilbert’s office abruptly declared Leewright ineligible and the board posted it was meeting for the third time and would reconsider all its votes.
Hilbert instead appointed Krista Ratliff, who serves as president and CEO of FISTA Innovation Park, a public-private partnership near Fort Sill in Lawton. Her group was at the Capitol during the last session promoting a new 3D-printed rocket propulsion system and fuel company.
Then, Gov. Kevin Stitt and Lonnie Paxton in a similarly opaque fashion used the opportunity to remove three board members who “coincidentally” voted to hold legislative pay flat at $47,500 a year. Those three men also insisted on holding discussions about legislative pay publicly, much like their predecessors had.
Stitt appointed Charlie Hannema, a public relations professional who used to work for him in the Governor’s Office, to replace Robert DeNegri. He also appointed Bill Kern to replace Brian Jackson.
Not to be outdone, Paxton, who publicly expressed displeasure with not getting a raise, dumped Gary Unruh in favor of Leslie Walker. Paxton said Unruh was unable to attend the meeting.
The new board of course cowardly refused to have a public discussion about pay, instead adjourning into the metaphorical smoke-filled room that has long defined insider dealings. We’re not even sure who exactly attended the executive session. Meeting minutes likely won’t be available for two years because the board won’t meet again until 2027. Meeting minutes for most state boards, which convene much more frequently, are available in a matter of weeks.
After the meeting, the board chair said the executive session allowed the members to discuss compensation more freely. The board cited a provision of law that allows public bodies to convene behind closed doors for the purpose of  “discussing the employment, hiring, appointment, promotion, demotion, disciplining or resignation of any individual salaried public officer or employee.” 
Huh. I always thought voters hired and fired lawmakers, not a board of political appointees eager to give their buddies a raise. Why else would we be holding elections?
Probably surprising nobody, this rigged board came back and boosted legislative salaries by 15%. They raised pay by $7,400 a year to $54,900 for a four-month job. They also doled out increased stipends for over a dozen leaders in the House and Senate. In all, this board increased the burden to taxpayers by $1.3 million a year.
This is not how boards and commissions are supposed to work. If leaders don’t get their way, they shouldn’t be allowed to randomly boot members in the middle of the process and appoint people more friendly to their cause.
So it’s refreshing that Jenkins is pushing back.
“Public service should never be about the money; it should be about sacrifice,” she said. “You can never pay a true public servant enough. But you can absolutely overpay a worthless politician.”
To clarify, we’re hardly paying poverty wages, even though we’re one of the most poverty-stricken states. In the Oklahoma City metro, the average person makes slightly over $58,000 for a year of work. Total compensation for state lawmakers not leadership is currently $72,869, including base salary, per diem payments, benefits and state retirement contributions. Oklahoma’s legislative salaries and per diem were already the second highest in the region at $60,828 for a four-month session. Only Colorado paid more at $63,914. Oklahoma lawmakers in leadership positions make more.
The legislative raises come as nationally consumers are increasingly dissatisfied with the economy following a record-setting government shutdown, slower hiring and inflation.
But while Jenkins showed up to represent us all, the problem is I don’t think Drummond has the intestinal fortitude to do the same.
His own attorney greenlighted this closed-door meeting, and before the ink had time to dry on Jenkins’ demand for Drummond to weigh in on the legality of the meeting, his office was already shouting from the rooftop that the meeting was legal.
So yeah, I think we all know how this is going to go.
Drummond, after all, wants to be governor.
Thanks to Jenkins, we’re all going to learn what Drummond stands for. 
Is he someone who believes voters employ lawmakers and that Oklahomans deserve transparency? Or is he someone who is willing to look the other way when, as Jenkins put it, things “don’t pass the smell test”?

As blazes expand to higher elevations, the impacts cascade downstream.
The post In burned forests, the West’s snowpack is melting earlier appeared first on WyoFile .","As the American West warms due to climate change, wildfires are increasingly burning in higher-elevation mountains, charring the watersheds where the region’s vital snowpack accumulates. 
A new study has found that in the immediate aftermath of fires across the region, the snowpack disappears earlier in burned areas. This change can threaten forest health and affect the downstream farms, cities and species that rely on the snowpack for their water, according to other research.
Scientists who study the effects of wildfires on the snowpack and streamflows are finding that the story is complex and nuanced. The impacts can vary greatly across the West’s diverse ecosystems and topography. Plus, each wildfire burns differently, so the severity of the blaze is another critical factor. 
While streamflow volume typically increases after a wildfire, the peak flows come earlier in the season, and the water may be clogged with sediment that can harm wildlife and water infrastructure. 
The new study, published in the Sept. 17 issue of Science Advances, used satellite data to track when the snowpack disappeared each season and examined how that timing changed after a fire burned through forests. The research also concluded that warming temperatures due to climate change will further accelerate post-fire melting. 
In the first year after a fire, the researchers found that under average winter conditions, snow melts earlier in 99% of the snow zone. “Postfire snow cover loss is more extreme in relatively low-elevation, warm environments compared to that in high-elevation, cold regions,” wrote the researchers from the Colorado School of Mines and the University of Colorado Boulder’s Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research.
The loss of the forest canopy due to a fire can actually increase snow accumulation on the ground below because scorched trees, which are missing branches and needles, intercept fewer falling snowflakes. But opening up the canopy changes the flow of energy in the forest by exposing the underlying snowpack to more solar radiation that can melt the snow.
Wildfires also cause soot and darkened debris to fall on the snowpack, which reduces its reflectivity, allows more heat to be absorbed and leads to quicker melting. Burned forests are also more susceptible to wind, which can further erode the snowpack.
“It’s basically just a big energy balance puzzle, but it seems like that increase in sunlight and decrease in the reflectivity of the snow are both leading to (an) earlier snow disappearance date,” said lead author Arielle Koshkin, a doctoral candidate in hydrologic science and engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. “Even if we do see more snowfall in the forest, it’s not overriding those energy balance changes.”
The study notes that previous research has found that the acreage of Western forests burned in the seasonal snow zone increased by up to 9% annually between 1984 and 2017, with the biggest rise in burned area occurring above an elevation of 2,500 meters (8,202 feet).
“Fire is burning higher and higher in elevation, which increases this overlap between where burned forests are and where it snows,” Koshkin said.
Stephanie Kampf, a professor of watershed science at Colorado State University who wasn’t involved in the study, said the findings are “pretty consistent with prior research,” showing that snow disappears earlier after a fire and that lower-elevation locations with more “transitional” snowpacks are more vulnerable. “This study shows it really nicely with a big dataset,” Kampf said. 
Climate change speeds up melting
Looking ahead, the authors project that post-fire melting will accelerate further as the West gets hotter due to rising atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases. If warming increases by 2 degrees Celsius — something that’s possible by the middle of the 21st century under some emissions scenarios — “73% of the snow zone would experience more extreme earlier postfire snowmelt compared to historically average conditions,” according to the paper.
“Under two degrees [Celsius] warming, the areas that already showed large changes are going to show even larger changes,” Koshkin said. “That warming is going to really have [an] impact on those warmer snow climates. So think maritime, Cascades, Sierras, comparative to the higher, colder, Rocky Mountain West.”
Previous research has also looked at what happens to the snowpack after a fire and found that the snow disappearance date moves up four to 23 days. Some of those studies have used ground-based observations, but the papers typically focused on one to three fires. Other research has examined snowpack readings from the automated SNOTEL network, but those snow sensors are usually placed in gaps in the forest canopy and may not capture the diversity of the West’s landscapes.
This new study relies on images captured by the MODIS instruments aboard two satellites to provide a westwide look at wildfire’s effects. Currently, satellites cannot measure the water content of the snowpack, known as the snow water equivalent. But repeated satellite imagery can detect whether snow is present on the ground, allowing researchers to measure when the snowpack disappears during the year.
“I was really interested in seeing if we could leverage remote sensing to look at it on a pixel-by-pixel scale across the whole Western United States to really try to understand, are we seeing the same responses in the Pacific Northwest as in Colorado?” Koshkin said. 
Each pixel in the MODIS satellite imagery represents a square on the ground with 500-meter (1,640-foot) edges. That’s a somewhat coarse resolution for measuring the snowpack, which can vary dramatically over very short distances, but the satellites provide daily or near-daily coverage. 
While satellite data offers broad coverage of the region, it has significant limitations. 
“The satellites can’t really peek underneath the forest canopy,” said Anne Nolin, a professor in the geography department at the University of Nevada, Reno, who wasn’t involved in the study. (Koshkin is a former student of Nolin’s.) “The other issue is that the satellite data can’t measure snow at times when there’s rain occurring or anytime there’s cloudiness. And so if you have a rain-on-snow event that’s changing your snowpack, which we’re having more and more, and which we would anticipate to occur more frequently, then you’re probably missing short-term changes in snowpack.”
Nolin said that the satellite-based estimates of the snowpack were “likely to be inaccurate in places where you have remaining forest, and especially in low-elevation snow zones and under warmer winter conditions.” That’s because previous studies have found that in warmer forests, the snow melts off under the canopy early, but it’s retained in the gaps between the trees, so the algorithm used to process the satellite imagery can overestimate the amount of snow in the pixel. “There’s less snow there than you think,” Nolin said. 
Stark regional differences
Elevation, temperature, burn severity, vegetation type and the amount of incoming solar radiation are among the drivers that explain when the snow disappears. The variability of these factors across the West may help explain why previous studies have found such a wide range in the timing of the snow disappearance date. 
“Everywhere we looked was disappearing earlier, but there were these kind of hotspots that disappeared way earlier,” Koshkin said. “I think the disruption in streamflow from these earlier melting-out pixels will be much more significant in Oregon, Washington and California.”
Wildfires had the biggest impact on the snowpack during the first five years after the blaze. In the first year after a fire, the snow disappearance date advanced by an average of 3.3 days. That might not sound like much, but the figure is just an average for the entire West — in some parts of Northern California and Oregon, the snow disappeared up to two weeks earlier. 
Over time, the effects of fire declined. Ten winters after a blaze, for example, the average snow disappearance date moved up by less than a day. 
While the advance of the snow disappearance date was most pronounced at lower elevations, the snowpack actually persisted slightly longer in some burned areas in Colorado and Utah, where the colder temperatures at higher elevations can insulate the snowpack from changes.
The finding that some higher elevation locations had a later snow disappearance date “would definitely be something to explore because everything that we know so far suggests that snow disappearance should be earlier after a fire,” Kampf said. 
Higher elevations may be less vulnerable to an early disappearance of the snowpack due to late-season storms. “Here in Colorado,” Kampf said, “we get a fair amount of spring snow, and so that’s one of the reasons why we’re not as sensitive because sometimes that snow just comes in May and it resets everything and you don’t see the big change in snow disappearance date.”
Another factor in explaining the regional differences is the West’s diversity of vegetation. 
“The forests are different in places that are colder, so you have different tree species and different densities of forest and different ecosystems in general,” Nolin said. “The northern tier of states and the high country — that’s where you would be probably seeing the least amount of change. It doesn’t mean, though, that you have the least amount of fire because some of these places, especially in places like Idaho and Washington state, have significant amount of fire, and there’s some interesting studies that have shown earlier snowmelt in those locations as well.”

How wildfires change streamflow
Previous research has found that wildfires can significantly alter the timing and magnitude of runoff in burned watersheds, but scientists are still unraveling the details.
“If you burn down the forest, you don’t have as many trees that are using that water,” Nolin said. “You probably expect the streamflow to be earlier because the snow’s melting off earlier.”
Fires can not only kill trees and ground cover that would absorb water — they can also eliminate organic material in the soil, which causes the ground to become more water repellent and makes the snowmelt more likely to run off into streams. 
A 2022 study that examined 72 forested basins that burned across the West found that average streamflow was significantly higher after a wildfire for an average of six years. The increase in streamflow was greater in areas where the extent of wildfire was larger. That study also found that the annual acreage burned by wildfires in the West skyrocketed by more than 1,100% from 1984 to 2020. 
Kampf said more research is needed to understand how streamflow changes after a fire. “We don’t have all those interactions figured out yet, but there have been some studies that have shown that streamflow actually decreases after fire,” Kampf said. “We certainly know it will affect streamflow timing, but the amount of streamflow we’re less sure.”
Fire intensity is one key determinant of subsequent streamflow. 
“If the forest is totally torched, then the increased solar radiation that’s coming into the snowpack is going to have a much bigger effect than if the trees still have live branches on them,” Kampf said. “Similarly, when you get down to the soil, if the soil is totally burned to a crisp, then its infiltration impacts will be much greater than if a lot of the litter and other stuff in the soil is still there.”
Nolin said she would have liked to see the authors distinguish between areas of high, moderate and low burn intensity. 
“When you see photographs of burned areas, we tend to show the photos that are most dramatic with just charred trunks that have [been] left behind, but in fact, most fires are mainly low to moderate burn severity that maintain the forest canopy,” Nolin said. “To not distinguish between different burn severities and to indicate that it’s all about the canopy being burned off and all of this carbon shedding on the snow — I think that stretches the results.”
The speed of vegetation recovery also shapes how the snowpack and streamflows respond to wildfire over time.
“If it’s a forest type where the vegetation can respond quickly and come back, that’s going to be a really different response than if the vegetation is slow to grow,” Kampf said. “Here in Colorado, we have some fires where it’s not coming back as forest at all, and where there are just no seedlings, and so we would expect the fire effect on snow to persist for a long time because we just don’t have trees coming back.”
The post-fire effects on streamflow tend to be localized, so it can be difficult to detect their impact on major river basins. 
“Even though the fires we’ve been experiencing have been really large, they’re still not huge compared to the size of the watershed as a whole,” Kampf said. “If you looked at something like the Colorado River Basin, it might be hard to detect the fire effect on the flow because there’s such a huge area that’s contributing to that flow. So in terms of how water is managed in forecasting and dam operations, I don’t think we’re there yet in terms of knowing how to account for fire.”
A major worry for water managers is the threat of high-intensity fires burning through dense stands of forest in the watersheds above their systems. 
“Those are places that water managers are concerned about because if the forest burns, then they experience problems with post-fire erosion and sedimentation and harms to water infrastructure, so it’s kind of a different side of the water management issue,” Kampf said.
Impacts on ecosystems
Besides posing challenges for water managers, wildfires can have profound effects on wildlife and forest health.
For aquatic ecosystems, “having a shift in the timing of when flow is coming in could also have an impact,” Kampf said, but “probably the greater impact is when that flow is bringing in with it a lot of sediments that are changing the habitat more profoundly.”
More rapid melting of the snowpack after a fire can also lead to a longer dry season for forests.
“If the snow disappears earlier, plants will start greening up sooner,” Kampf said. “If they’re not getting a lot of summer rain, they may find drier conditions later in the growing season that can stress plants.”
In addition to snow disappearing earlier due to fires, Nolin said the weather in November is getting drier. “If you have an earlier snow disappearance date and a later snowfall date, that dry season’s really getting quite a bit longer, and so it means that you have a decline in forest health and you also have an increase in the potential” for a longer fire season, Nolin said.
How burned ecosystems will respond to fire remains an open question as the climate continues to warm. In many parts of the West, decades have passed since flames swept through a forest, but trees have yet to return.
The burned trees may be centuries old, “and the climate was different than when those little seedlings sprouted and became the big trees that ultimately were involved in the fire,” Nolin said. “They grew initially under a different climate, and we don’t have that climate anymore, so we might see a lot more shrubs.”
Nolin said the paper “used a very simplistic approach to looking at future impacts on snow” by only examining what will happen under 2 degrees Celsius of warming. Climate change will also alter such factors as relative humidity and precipitation, so including these other effects “would’ve been more nuanced and perhaps a little more supportable,” Nolin said. She would have liked to see the results for various temperature increases up to 4 degrees Celsius, noting that mountains are warming faster due to climate change, and a key question is whether rain or snow will fall under warmer conditions. 
“Just having a single temperature change to look at helps us understand the impacts of temperature, and that’s great, but there is a lot more to be done in this area,” Nolin said.

Chronic wasting disease, or CWD, is a fatal and contagious neurological disease that threatens hooved mammals, such as elk and deer. 
The disease is a threat to domestic and wild animals, according to the Idaho State Department of Agriculture. 
“We tested it for CWD and it came back negative – that was the biggest concern right there,” Idaho Department of Fish and Game spokesman Roger Phillips said Wednesday. 
Phillips said it is extremely rare for a domestic elk to escape from a fenced facility in Idaho and be shot by a hunter. He said he is not aware of any other such instances, and said the hunter was not cited and is not under investigation. 
Because chronic wasting disease is a fatal disease that is able to be spread between animals through means that include contact with infected body fluids, stopping or limiting spread of the disease is a concern for state officials at the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture and hunters across the West. 
For the first time in state history, domestic elk from two eastern Idaho captive domestic elk facilities tested positive for CWD in 2024 and early 2025, according to the Idaho State Department of Agriculture. 
 State is investigating the escape, Idaho state veterinarian says

The escaped domestic elk killed this fall was in eastern Idaho’s hunting unit 63A, Phillips said. Unit 63A includes portions of two of the counties – Madison County and Jefferson County – where the state reported positive CWD cases at domestic elk facilities.

Idaho State Veterinarian Dr. Scott Leibsle said the state is investigating the escape.  
“We are aware of the escape, and as provided in statute, we conduct an investigation regarding any escaped domestic elk,” Leibsle said in a phone interview. “The investigation is ongoing, and we can’t comment on the specifics.”
In general, Leibsle said investigations involve an inspection of the facility where the domestic elk escaped, an interview with the facility’s owner or staff and the reconciliation of the year-end inventory count of domestic animals at the facility. Depending on the size of the facility and number of animals, the inventory and reconciliation process could take a couple of months and may not be completed until spring, Leibsle said. 
Part of the reason for the inventory and reconciliation phase of investigation is to ensure that all of the animals are accounted for and that no other animals are missing or could have escaped. 
There are several types of domestic cervidae or domestic elk facilities in Idaho. Some are breeding facilities, some raise the animals for meat or to sell and some operate high-fenced hunting ranches, where clients pay to hunt big game or trophy animals such as elk or buffalo on fenced, private land. Some large facilities include a combination of several types of facilities.  
An example of a fenced hunting ranch is the Broadmouth Canyon Ranch, which is located in eastern Idaho near Firth and owned by former NFL player Rulon Jones. 
Jeff Abrams, wildlife associate with the Idaho Conservation League, said the escaped elk was killed on state land located about three miles from the Broadmouth Canyon Ranch’s fenced hunting facility. 
State officials have declined to name the specific facility where the domestic elk escaped from. 
Less than two years ago, Jones and his son Chase Jones testified in favor of a new Idaho state law that removed a requirement to have double-fencing in place at domestic facilities where animals have tested positive for CWD.
 Elk escaped after Idaho Legislature loosened fencing regulations for domestic facilities

The domestic elk escaped less than two years after the Idaho Legislature passed a 2024 law, House Bill 591, that eliminated the requirement to place double-fencing around quarantined domestic Cervidae or elk farms that were under quarantine orders following a positive CWD test. The law also allowed for the transfer of potentially infected animals to other captive elk facilities under the same ownership, according to minutes of the Idaho Legislature’s Senate Agricultural Affairs Committee. 
Conservationists and wildlife groups opposed the law during public committee hearings at the Idaho State Capitol in 2024. 
Jonathan Oppenheimer, then of the Idaho Conservation League, and Brian Brooks and Garrett Visser of the Idaho Wildlife Foundation, argued that passing the law would weaken existing rules put in place attempting to contain the spread of chronic wasting disease among domestic elk. Oppenheimer told legislators that the double-fencing rule was specifically put in place to allow domestic elk operators to import animals from Alberta, Canada, where CWD is more prevalent. 
On the other hand, former Sen. Jeff Siddoway, R-Terreton, said that the double-fencing requirement was a strict and onerous government regulation that would put domestic elk ranching operations out of business, according to minutes from the Senate Agricultural Affairs Committee. Siddoway said it could cost $80,000 to $100,000 per mile of fence to comply with the double-fencing requirement. 
Chase Jones told Idaho legislators that he has 18 miles of fencing around his ranch and the double-fencing requirement would cost him between $1.3 million and $1.6 million, state records show. The double-fencing requirement would cripple his business, he said. 
In arguing for the law’s passage in March 2024, Siddoway told legislators that no domestic elk had tested positive for chronic wasting disease in Idaho. 
Siddoway was correct.
But later that year, in December 2024, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture announced that a bull elk that had been transferred from Alberta, Canada, to a domestic elk ranch in Madison County, Idaho, died and tested positive for CWD. 
It was the first case in state history of a positive CWD test at a domestic elk facility in Idaho.
Just over two weeks later, on Jan. 3, 2025, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture announced that a second domestic elk located at a different captive elk ranch located in Jefferson County, Idaho, had died and tested positive for CWD. 
Idaho State Department of Agriculture officials said the second case of CWD was not associated with the first positive case announced just two weeks prior. 
Following the second positive test, Department of Agriculture officials issued a quarantine order to restrict further movement of domestic elk at the Jefferson County facility. 
The Department of Agriculture did not identify the specific domestic elk facilities. Instead, officials announced the county where each facility was located.
In an interview last week, Leibsle, the state veterinarian, told the Idaho Capital Sun that the department’s policy is to announce cases at the county level. 
Leibsle told the Sun he did not take a position on the 2024 law. Instead, he said his job is to simply comply with and enforce the state laws on the books. Leibsle told the Sun that that double-fencing requirement would be a heavy economic burden to comply with and may not prevent the spread of CWD. 
For example, if a domestic elk died within the second fence, CWD could still be spread if rainfall washed infected tissue from a dead animal outside of the fence or if a vulture or buzzard picked up pieces of an infected dead animal’s flesh and moved the flesh somewhere else or spread inflected prions through defecating. 
“There are a lot of different opportunities for this to be spread, and it’s just not very well understood,” Leibsle said. 
However, Leibsle said a double fence could potentially limit the spread of CWD in some ways.
“If they had a double fence with separation, that would limit nose-to-nose contact between wild and domestic animals,” Leibsle said.

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Queen Sweeen is coming to Trenton.
Marisa Sweeney, a vegan nutritionist and yoga instructor who goes by “Queen Sweeen” on Instagram, will join the New Jersey Assembly in January after flipping a legislative seat that had been in Republican hands for over half a century.
Sweeney had never run for elected office before she beat two-term incumbent Assemblyman Christian Barranco in Morris County’s 25th Legislative District last month, snagging the most votes in a four-way race. Her win is “just starting to feel real,” she told the New Jersey Monitor.
“Honestly, I’m just coming down from all the surrealness of it,” she said. “It’s a good feeling, because I’m ready to get to work.”
Sweeney attributed her win partly to Democrats’ dominance in the Nov. 4 election both nationally and in New Jersey, including Mikie Sherrill’s resounding victory in the governor’s race. Sweeney’s legislative district lies within the congressional district Sherrill represented for seven years.
But Sweeney is also a known name in her community, she said, as a longtime Morristown business owner. She founded and runs a women’s health and wellness center in Morristown called Be Well Integrative Health Services, which also provides nutrition programs in 10 other states under a partnership with a chain of fertility clinics. She also owns the New Jersey VegFest, a biannual vegan food festival in Montclair and Asbury Park.
Voters were receptive to her message, she said. She cast herself during the campaign as a change agent in a country battered by inflation and affordability concerns, the recent government shutdown, and the Trump administration’s controversial cuts and policy changes.
She assured voters she is a “regular person” and not one of the career politicians who pack Trenton’s Statehouse and other political arenas.
“I’m ecstatic — ecstatic! — to be here. I knew on paper going into this race that I was the underdog,” Sweeney said, referring to the GOP’s longtime control of the district.
She added: “I want to be part of — not to sound too corny — but making the world a better place, honestly. I’m very heart-driven, and I like to think people connected with that.”
Sweeney will represent the district with incumbent Assemblywoman Aura Dunn, a Republican.
Debbie Walsh is director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University’s Eagleton Institute of Politics. She said Sweeney’s win holds lessons for party leaders.
“It sends a message that women are a good return on investment as candidates,” Walsh said.

Sweeney will stand out in the Legislature as “someone who’s a little outside the box,” Walsh said, pointing to her age, gender, and “vibrant presence” on social media.
Sweeney will be one of the Legislature’s youngest members, at 41, and among its few women. The Assembly, where men outnumber women by more than 2 to 1, lost seven female incumbents in last month’s general election but gained three women newcomers — Sweeney, Katie Brennan in Hudson County’s 32nd District, and Maureen Rowan in Atlantic County’s 2nd District.
They’ll enter the Statehouse at a tumultuous time in New Jersey politics, as the power of party leaders slowly wanes after the toppling of the controversial county line. Under that system, ballot placement largely favored candidates supported by county party leaders.
“I think what’s going to be fascinating to watch is how they function in this institution, because they are not as beholden to a party in the same way of folks who came up in the past. They may not just fall into lockstep” with legislative and party leaders, Walsh said.
Sweeney said she and her running mate, Steve Pylypchuk, didn’t rely on their party’s backing or raise much money.
“I’m going into this not connected to anything or anyone,” she said. “I’m going to do everything that I can to just stay true to me and why I decided to do this in the first place.”
Sweeney, who grew up in Brick and graduated from Montclair State University, isn’t a total political rookie. She serves on Morristown’s planning board and has testified and lobbied on various health bills in Trenton in her role as a former board member and president of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
Her experience testifying before state legislators made her want to become one, she added.
“We were presenting the research- and evidence-based solutions to people — and then hoping that it was going to pass,” she said. “Instead of waiting around for other people to decide things, I wanted to be part of actually making changes that need to happen.”
In Trenton, she aims to protect social safety nets and champion measures to strengthen health care, which she complained have weakened under President Donald Trump’s administration. Her anger with his policies is clear on her social media, where she has blasted the feds’ brief suspension of food assistance, its Medicaid cuts, and its recent exclusion of nursing, teaching, and other careers from the list of professional degrees eligible for federal loans.
“It’s most certainly not humane in terms of building our communities and allowing people to thrive, but it’s also most certainly not good for our economy either,” she said. “I think it’s shortsighted for people to think that by making all these cuts that it’s going to strengthen our economy. Both of those things can actually exist simultaneously — we can take care of people, and we can do it in a fiscally responsible way.”
She also hopes to focus on improving affordability for both residents and small business owners. Beyond that, she figures she’ll do a lot of listening and see where the job takes her.
“The nature of what I do for nutrition counseling is a lot of listening, and as basic and rudimentary as that might sound, I don’t think there’s enough listening to constituents to really hear what the needs are,” she said. “So I’m coming in with an open heart and open ears.”

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson/Tennessee Lookout)Two weeks after the City of Martin’s mayor and economic development director were indicted on multiple felony charges of theft and official misconduct, remaining city leadership is facing a reckoning. 
The Martin City Board of Aldermen unanimously accepted the resignations of former Mayor Randal “Randy” Brundige and former economic development director Bradley Thompson during a special meeting on Nov. 25.
Before the board voted to appoint Vice Mayor David Belote as the city’s mayor — a position he would hold until the next city election in November 2026 — one of the board’s newest members questioned how Martin could move forward under the leadership of officials who were in power over the last decade and failed to catch nearly half a million dollars in alleged misappropriations.
Jacob Crowe, who began representing Ward 3 in December 2024, called for the resignations of Belote, Alderman Danny Nanney and Alderman Terry Hankins, each of whom served on the city’s Finance Committee over the last decade. The trio was not mentioned in the Tennessee comptroller’s report, nor do they face charges.
“Our city is hurting right now, and there are people that have lost confidence in what this board is … I don’t know if we can move forward with the confidence of how this board sits,” Crowe said.
Belote said the city could hold a special election for a new mayor as early as April 2026, but that would be within a few months of the city’s regularly scheduled election in November.
The board approved Belote’s appointment 4-1, with Crowe voting no. But after several members of the public expressed their concerns about the board’s lack of oversight, Belote said he too would consider resigning.

“I don’t know what processes are going to take place in order for that to happen, but I hear you,” Belote said. “Do I want to be part of (the work ahead)? Sure, I would like to, but … you’ve said what you’ve said, and I’ve taken it in. And if it’s time, it’s time, for me.”
Brundige, Thompson, and Brundige’s daughter, Natalie, were indicted on Nov. 12 after an investigation by the Tennessee Comptroller’s Office uncovered a combined misuse of more than $450,000 in public funds since February 2015. 
Brundige, who served as Martin’s mayor since 2002, is accused of using his city-issued credit card to pay for high-end meals, alcohol and other questionable purchases, according to the comptroller’s report. Natalie Brundige, a former custodian for the Martin Police Department, received at least $174,000 over six years as a full-time employee, though she routinely worked only two hours of her scheduled 8-hour shifts, the report states. 
Thompson, who also owns a firm called One Consulting, billed the city for grant writing and administrative services completed by the firm that were already part of his official duties as economic development director, according to investigators. Randy Brundige approved the payments to the firm despite the lack of a contract between the company and the city.
In his resignation letter, Thompson listed the city’s accomplishments in his 13-year tenure and said the allegations against him are “unfounded.” 
“I conducted my work with the full approval of the mayor, the board of alderpersons and legal counsel,” Thompson wrote. “Never once … did I write a check to myself. Each check payable to me was approved, written and signed by at least four authorized employees.”
Randy Brundige brought a resolution to the board to retroactively approve One Consulting’s work for the city on Nov. 12, 2024 after investigators began to question the firm’s invoices, according to the comptroller’s report.
Meeting minutes show the board at the time — including Belote, Nanney and Hankins — unanimously approved the resolution with no questions.
‘Business as usual’
Belote said Martin’s Finance Committee, which is composed of five aldermen, a chairman and two citizens, didn’t meet as much as needed over the last three years.
Crowe, who has nearly 20 years of experience in finance, noted that he was not appointed to the finance committee.
The committee met at the behest of the mayor, Belote said, adding that he asked the mayor to call more finance meetings several times, to no avail.
“We elected a mayor — you elected a mayor – for six terms. Six terms. Now, what does that say? It says … the people of Martin wanted Randy Brundige as the mayor. And you cast that vote because you trust that person,” Belote said. “You trust that person to do their job. You trust that person to do the things that the charter requires in order to be mayor. The mayor runs the internal operations of the city. Everything comes from him.”
Hankins said the board “didn’t know anything about” the alleged misappropriations. Regarding the board’s approval of the contract with One Consulting in 2024, Belote said the board wasn’t told that Thompson owned the company.
“We’re just thinking this is business as usual,” Belote said. “So that information was not given to us. Should we have known it?”
“Yes,” a member of the audience answered.
“I don’t know, but we did not, and it wasn’t revealed to us until the eleventh hour,” Belote continued.
An audio recording of the November 2024 meeting published by The Weakley County Examiner shows the board was told that Thompson owned One Consulting prior to their vote.
Residents call for transparency; Board calls for civic participation
Martin residents who addressed the board spoke of the need for more transparency and accountability. A few reminded the board and audience that Randy Brundige, Thompson and Natalie Brundige have been charged but not yet convicted. Some residents and board members called for more community involvement in local politics.
Jordan Long, an attorney, said aldermen were using what he calls the “Shaggy Defense”: “It wasn’t me,” a reference to the popular song “It Wasn’t Me” released by Jamaican-American reggae musician Shaggy in 2000. Long read an email he sent to the board on Nov. 15, 2024 — three days after the board approved the One Consulting contract — informing them that Thompson owned the company. 










Your prolonged failure of oversight is an unacceptable breach of duty. Resignation is the only honorable choice remaining.


– Kent Kelso, Martin resident


Long said it is correct that the residents of Martin voted to put Randy Brundige in office.
“We don’t pass a budget. We don’t have a level of oversight that you all do. Don’t tell us that we failed, because you failed,” he said.
Kent Kelso, a professor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, said “numerous officials,” including the Board of Aldermen, showed a “pattern of knowing and willful neglect” and breaches of the city’s charter.
Kelso called for the investigation and removal of “all personnel implicit in the misconduct … and those who have kept silent, thus aiding and abetting these issues.” He also asked for the resignation of board members and city officials who held office “throughout these years of documented corruption, fraud, malfeasance, and felonious acts.”
“Your prolonged failure of oversight is an unacceptable breach of duty,” Kelso said. “Resignation is the only honorable choice remaining.”
Joyce Washington, a resident since 2007, said the city now has a “perception problem” and needs to move forward. 
“We have to do something different than move forward with the composition of the … board as it is currently constituted,” Washington said. 
She added that some of the board meetings she has attended in the past have been short — around 10 minutes — and called for more transparency
“If we had that, we wouldn’t be sitting here tonight,” Washington said.
Reflecting on his time in office, Belote, who is 72, said he ran for all six of his terms with no opposition. For his last two terms, he waited to file his petition to see who else, if anyone, would throw their hat in the ring. No one did. 
“That’s not right for any system,” he said.
Hankins said he ran unopposed for four of his five terms. 
“Sometimes I wonder if anybody cares,” Hankins said.
He said he won’t seek reelection in 2026.

(Courtesy photo)Nearly 3,000 North Carolinians could lose housing under changes to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s [HUD] competitive grant program for permanent housing, according to an estimate by the National Alliance to End Homelessness.
The alliance and other advocates are bracing for HUD reforms that will dramatically change the way the federal government funds permanent housing assistance programs.
The changes could cost the state more than $24 million in funding for programs that house people experiencing homelessness, the organization told N.C. Newsline. Nationally, more than 170,000 people could be at risk of homelessness due to changes to the $3.9 billion grant program, the alliance said.

“Without that funding, it means services are disrupted, if not stopped altogether,” said Marcy Thompson, the alliance’s vice president of programs and policy. “If they [service providers] can’t continue operating, landlords don’t get rent. It creates a lot of distrust within the community.”
Grant reapplication required
At issue are federal Continuum of Care (CoC) grants, which is the largest federal grant program specifically for assisting people experiencing homelessness. 
The competitive grants are awarded on a two-year cycle, but HUD has required a new competition one year into the funding cycle.
“What we know is, there was originally a two-year promise,” said Liz Carbone, project specialist with the North Carolina Coalition to End Homelessness. “That promise has been walked back.”

Carbone said the new competition could delay funding until spring for some awardees, leaving nonprofits scrambling to fill funding gaps to pay rent.
“We know that conservatively, best case, we will not see awards in our state until the end of May,” Carbone said. “The funding delay alone is going to be so deeply painful for our state.”
Most communities do not have the resources on hand to fill funding gaps if there are significant delays in grant awards, Carbone said. “If communities feel the need to assume these programs and keep them going, which I think most communities will, that’s a cost to the local taxpayer.” 
Federal money for homeless programs is dispersed through 12 Continuums of Care in North Carolina. Most are focused on larger cities such as Asheville, Charlotte, Durham, Raleigh and Wilmington.

Program priorities reversed
The controversial program changes come as HUD breaks from the long-favored “Housing First” approach, which prioritizes providing immediate access to permanent housing without prerequisites. HUD is moving to a transitional housing approach that includes work and sobriety requirements.

“These long-overdue reforms will promote independence and ensure we are supporting means-tested approaches to carry out the President’s mandate, connect Americans with the help they need, and make our cities and towns beautiful and safe,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a statement announcing the changes.
One of the HUD reforms caps the amount of funding that each Continuum of Care (CoC) can use for permanent housing at no more than 30% of CoC funding. Currently, 87% of CoC-funded projects are for permanent housing or rapid-rehousing.
A new scoring criteria penalizes nonprofits competing for federal grants if they are located in areas that don’t, for example, have public camping bans in place. A statewide bill in North Carolina to enact such a ban stalled in the state Senate but some local municipalities have such bans in place.  
In July, President Trump issued an executive order that directed the HUD secretary and other cabinet secretaries to “determine whether priority” for grants may be given to grantees in states and municipalities that actively enforce prohibitions on urban camping and loitering, open illicit drug use and urban squatting.
The policy changes also penalize nonprofits for promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) or “gender ideology extremism,” and for the alleged “misuse of and abuse of taxpayers dollars on illegal aliens.”
“Some of the things that HUD is essentially penalizing organizations and communities for are things that were required of them in the last administration,” said Marcy Thompson at the National Alliance to End Homelessness. “There’s no community, no organization that is not at risk of being impacted here.”
Twenty congressional Republicans have asked HUD Secretary Scott Turner to renew grants expiring in 2026 for an additional year.
“This extension is essential to prevent service disruptions for individuals and families experiencing homelessness, sustain continuity of care for vulnerable populations, and allow HUD adequate time to implement its next generation of homelessness policy reforms,” the Republicans said in a letter to Turner.
While none of North Carolina’s congressional Republicans signed the letter, Carbone said advocates have had “super productive conversations” with several GOP U.S. House members and Republican U.S. Sens. Ted Budd and Thom Tillis.  
“They see the impacts that this is going to have, not just in the cities, but in the rural communities, and what this is going to do to North Carolina’s ability to keep the most vulnerable people in our state housed,” Carbone said. 
“Regardless of your political affiliation … we all care about seniors, we all care about families with young kids and we all care about veterans,” Carbone said.
Impact on the ground

In Statesville, Tamara Roach, executive director of Fifth Street Ministries, is three months into her new job. Roach would like to spend time meeting with donors, reviewing programs and preparing Thanksgiving meals the nonprofit will provide on Thursday. 
But recent days have been hectic. Roach has been busy with paperwork to meet this past Monday’s deadline for “letters of intent” to apply for the new HUD grants. Formal applications are due Jan. 14, she said.  
Nonprofits were only given a week to respond, she said.     
“I don’t think that providers are panicking, but we are paying attention,” Roach said. “It’s a very quick turnaround.” 
She said it’s healthy that HUD has asked providers to rethink models, reexamine how they define a disability and to discuss which services are leading to long-term housing stability.
“It’s just that we’re not being given much time at all to think about this and pivot,” Roach said. “I think some decisions folks are going to make are not going to be popular, but people can’t keep doing what they’ve always been doing without other collaboration and without other partners stepping up.”
To illustrate how funding changes could impact her organization, Roach shared a story about a client who lived in her car for months. Under the current funding model, Fifth Street Ministries, placed her in rapid rehousing, signed her up for counseling, connected her to medication to treat a bipolar disorder and enrolled her in a job training program.
Today, the client is housed and stable, Roach said.
“Under the new criteria, she may no longer qualify for that pathway because her bipolar disorder is no longer considered a disability,” Roach said. “If something happens and she’s not supported, it’s not as if she’s going to disappear. She’s going to cycle back to living in cars and shelters.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Image-7-e1764349534150-1024x769.png,,,2025-12-01 06:56:26.373488

(Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)The state of play for Arkansas’ young-yet-ambitious lithium industry has changed markedly compared to one year ago, even as questions remain about the impacts of low lithium prices on projects.
Almost exactly a year after prospective producers were dealt a defeat by the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission over proposed royalty payments, business executives and lawmakers extolled the potential of the state’s lithium industry at the 2025 edition of the Arkansas Lithium Innovation Summit last month. Speakers from Google, Standard Lithium, Chevron, Fastmarkets and more spoke of how Arkansas’ lithium reserves could play into national security objectives, data centers for artificial intelligence and the clean energy transition.
Policymakers like Arkansas Secretary of Commerce Hugh McDonald touted Arkansas’ long history with the oil and gas industry and business-friendly climate to position the state as a future national leader in the “energy storage value chain.”
 
Read more about the big players in Arkansas’ lithium industry, and the events leading up to the first lithium royalty approval, here.


“When we met in February 2024, we spoke of promise. Now, in October 2025, we speak of progress. Extraordinary progress has been made in Arkansas the last 18 months,” McDonald said during remarks at the start of the summit. “We have a world-class resource in the Smackover Formation. … We aspire to become the most reliable, economic and sustainable domestic lithium resource.”
Extracting Arkansas’ underground lithium could be game changing for the U.S. as a whole as it tries to break its reliance on China and other foreign countries for the critical mineral that powers everything from smartphones to electric vehicles. A U.S. Geological Survey study found last year that Southwest Arkansas alone could produce enough lithium to supply the entirety of the world’s demand for car batteries in 2030 nine times over — though that study didn’t examine whether it was possible to extract all of it.
Lithium is found in the Smackover Formation’s salty brines, thousands of feet below the earth’s surface. Companies like ExxonMobil and Standard Lithium aim to extract it using commercially untested direct lithium extraction technology, which is similar to water softening. The formation stretches from East Texas to the western side of the Florida Panhandle, and the section underlying South Arkansas has long been associated with the Natural State’s oil and gas industry.
The summit came after a year and a half of back-and-forth between the state’s oil and gas regulator and prospective lithium producers over fair and equitable royalties for south Arkansas mineral rights owners. The Oil and Gas Commission approved royalty payment structures for two companies this year, clearing what has been referred to as the final undetermined regulatory hurdle.
The royalties aside, big names in Arkansas’ lithium space said they made strides in 2025. Canada-based Standard Lithium and Equinor, a Norwegian energy company, released a string of positive news about the feasibility of its Smackover Lithium project. The two companies have pointed to $225 million in U.S. Department of Energy funding and its designation as a priority critical mineral project by the Trump administration as evidence of the project’s strengths. Executives with the companies said on multiple occasions that they would make a decision about giving the final go-ahead for the project by early 2026.
Meanwhile, Chevron joined fellow American petroleum giants ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum in snapping up mineral rights in the state’s southwest region.
Shane Khoury, secretary of the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment, told the Advocate in an interview at the summit that figuring out the royalty had been a long process, but that future lithium royalties would be able to rely on its precedent.
“I think [the royalty-setting process] was a little bit longer than we probably all anticipated,” Khoury said, in part because the state “didn’t have anybody to turn to and look at and say, ‘How do we value this process?’”
The state’s existing regulatory framework for brine extraction guided the process, Khoury said. Companies have been extracting bromine from brine in South Arkansas since the 1960s. The structure of the two approved royalties provides both a framework for other Arkansas lithium projects and for lithium projects in other states, he said.
“We kind of had to invent the wheel to start,” Khoury said. “They don’t have to reinvent the wheel.”
Still, much of the optimism at the summit was cautious. While remaining positive overall about the trajectory of the U.S. lithium industry over the few decades, multiple business leaders warned of how lithium prices, down from a massive pandemic-era spike thanks to supply outstripping demand, could negatively affect the U.S. industry’s attempts to get off the ground should they not increase. And closer to home, local community leaders from South Arkansas and executives from utility companies said that the region would be facing growing demands for power, housing and other resources that will likely need to be built out rapidly as the industry grows.
First-of-its-kind lithium technology accelerator kicks off in Arkansas

“The lithium industry, much like a lot of the new industries coming to Arkansas, are big power consumers,” Entergy Arkansas Vice President of Business Operations and Strategy Kristen Dalrymple said during a panel on infrastructure.
Arkansas’ transmission capacity is nearing its limits, which likely means there will be a large expansion of power transmission in the state in the coming years, Dalrymple said.
Nonprofit electric grid manager, Little Rock-based Southwest Power Pool, approved an $8.6 billion plan in November to upgrade and expand transmission grid capabilities across 14 states, Arkansas Business reported.
The need for more electricity and expanded transmission lines is especially true in the rural South Arkansas areas where lithium companies are locating, Dalrymple said. Striking a balance between attracting business and maintaining affordability is important, especially at a time where demand for power and grid upgrades is growing nationally as well, which impacts cost and timelines, she said.
“I’ll just say that it is unprecedented levels of growth we were talking about,” Dalrymple said. “So it’s an exciting time, but it’s a challenge in terms of making sure that we’re planning ahead, but also not overcommitting. So we need to strike that right balance.”
For its part, Entergy is seeking regulatory approval to build a $1.6 billion gas-fueled power plant near Redfield to take up some of the energy generating slack when it retires two coal-fired plants, one in 2028 and another in 2030, Arkansas Business reported.
Despite the challenges, policymakers remain optimistic.
“The lithium boom requires everything from skilled engineers to updated power grids and new housing and finally, state and federal policies that enable end-to-end development of the nation’s lithium supply chain,” McDonald said. “We can’t be all things to all sections of the supply chain, so, for now, we want to focus our strategy and lean into our natural advantages in building an industrial ecosystem.”
Republican Sen. Steve Crowell of Magnolia told the Advocate that while hurdles, such as power infrastructure and overcoming skepticism from financial backers beyond Arkansas, remain for the industry, “we’re moving in the right direction.”
Crowell said that 18 months previously there were still lots of unknowns about the lithium extraction projects.
“Now, as you’re seeing, there’s lots of facts, there’s lots of stats, there’s lots of things that are going down,” he said.
Local, state and federal leadership have been aligned in a way he called “an anomaly” to help the lithium industry succeed. Crowell said he would be shocked if there weren’t more large leaps by the industry in 2026.
“So that is a million dollar question: Where are we going to be a year from now?” Crowell said. “As I see it, it’s only a trajectory of up.”

Groups such as the American Library Association, Penguin Random House, the National Coalition Against Censorship and Lambda Literary were joined this week by PEN America, a nonprofit organization that advocates for free speech by defending literature and human rights, in denouncing directives by Secretary of State Tre Hargett. He is requiring libraries that receive state or federal grant funds to make an “age-appropriate” review of books and meet an order by President Donald Trump called “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.”
The order has required some libraries to shut down temporarily, according to a WTVF report, and go through the expensive task of poring over books to determine whether they contain gender identity topics.

More than 30 organizations nationally signed on to a letter expressing “profound concern” about Hargett’s September and October letters issued within the Tennessee Regional Library System demanding a full review within 60 days. In addition to creating “widespread confusion, fear and operational disruption” in libraries statewide, the order put a costly burden on libraries and created the risk of illegal censorship, the letter says.
“It is illegal to remove books from public libraries because some people do not like them. This is a well-settled legal principle,” the letter says. It adds that reviews for removal based on a person’s “subjective opinion” threaten First Amendment rights.
The letter also says the executive order, which regulates only federal agencies, is not legislation and points out that Congress opted not to pursue such a bill.
Hargett’s Sept. 8 letter to the Library Regional System ordering the reviews says Trump’s executive order prevents federal funds from being used to promote gender ideology, which “replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity.”
The secretary of state also makes note of a new state law, Dismantling DEI Departments Act, that “prevents governmental entities from using discriminatory preferences to promote diversity, equity, or inclusion.” He encourages libraries with questions about grant contracts or federal and state laws to contact their county attorney.
Final reports by regional libraries are to be made by Jan. 19, 2026 to the Tennessee State Librarian and Archivist.
Hargett’s office didn’t return a call Wednesday seeking comment.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline is appealing a North Dakota’s judge’s decision not to interfere in a free speech lawsuit Greenpeace filed against the company overseas.
The Amsterdam-based Greenpeace International filed the case in February in response to Energy Transfer’s lawsuit accusing it of engaging in acts including conspiracy and defamation to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline from being built. 
That lawsuit, which is ongoing in North Dakota district court, is also against two other Greenpeace entities: Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace Fund. In March, a Morton County jury handed down a more than $660 million verdict against Greenpeace, which the court later slashed by roughly half.
Greenpeace International’s counter-suit in the Netherlands alleges that Energy Transfer’s legal challenge is a ploy to waste its time and money. The Dutch case also claims Energy Transfer is liable for making defamatory statements about the environmental group. Greenpeace International has asked the court to order Energy Transfer to award it monetary damages.
Energy Transfer this summer asked Southwest District Court Judge James Gion to suspend the overseas lawsuit until the North Dakota case plays out — a request he rejected in September. 
Gion found that the cases consider different legal claims, so he didn’t think it necessary to stop the foreign action. Gion also stated he didn’t believe the Netherlands case would move quickly enough to affect the lawsuit in his court.
Now Energy Transfer wants the North Dakota Supreme Court to step in and order Gion to pause the Dutch lawsuit. The high court is set to hear arguments on the appeal on Dec. 18. 
In its petition to the Supreme Court, Energy Transfer claims the Dutch case “collaterally attacks the jury verdict” and is an attempt to sidestep North Dakota’s legal system.
“This Court’s intervention is needed to prevent a foreign entity (Greenpeace) from inviting a foreign tribunal to sit in judgment over North Dakota’s judiciary,” Energy Transfer wrote.
While Energy Transfer acknowledges no North Dakota court has ever attempted to pause a case in another country, they say it’s necessary in order to preserve the integrity of the North Dakota suit.
Judge slashes jury damages in Greenpeace case to $345 million

Greenpeace International has indicated it will participate in oral arguments before the high court in support of Gion’s decision. In legal documents, the organization said Energy Transfer has no basis for involving it in the North Dakota suit in the first place. It said it never had any staff visit North Dakota during the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, and that it only ever peripherally supported activism against the pipeline.
“International is a Netherlands entity with no connection to North Dakota,” it wrote. “It has thus consistently objected to Plaintiffs’ contentions that it could be haled into this jurisdiction to defend itself.”
Greenpeace was one of many activist groups that backed a movement led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to halt construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which drew thousands of activists to protest in south-central North Dakota in 2016 and 2017.
The pipeline, often referred to as DAPL, carries crude oil from wells in northwest North Dakota to Illinois and has been in operation since 2017.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The state of North Dakota filed a friend-of-the-court brief in Energy Transfer’s appeal in support of neither party. 
The Supreme Court should use the case as an opportunity to develop guidelines on how North Dakota courts should handle requests to halt foreign lawsuits in the future, the state argued.
“In our current era of increasing political polarization, cross-jurisdictional legal tensions are likely to recur as polities continue to be increasingly aggressive in adopting divergent laws,” it wrote.
According to the state’s brief, orders to pause overseas lawsuits are generally warranted when the foreign case is substantially similar to a domestic lawsuit, and when the foreign action could impede the United States’ ability to enforce its own laws.
Greenpeace International’s lawsuit was filed under a 2024 European Union directive meant to protect activists and whistleblowers who face arbitrary legal action for exercising their free speech rights.
Greenpeace International has said its case may be the first to be filed under the new law.
The state of North Dakota in its brief appeared critical of the directive, writing that it “may have been purposefully enacted to facilitate the filing of lawsuits to collaterally challenge or undermine judicial proceedings that occur in third countries.”
Gion has yet to enter a final judgment in the North Dakota lawsuit. Earlier this month, he cut the jury’s more than $660 million verdict against Greenpeace to about $345 million.
Greenpeace has indicated previously that once Gion enters a judgment, it will ask for a new trial. If that request is unsuccessful, they will appeal the case to the North Dakota Supreme Court.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)In 1965, after creating Medicare to provide health services for people over the age of 65, the federal government created Medicaid to help low-income children and disabled people of all ages access necessary health and human services. Medicare is funded and administered at the federal level. Medicaid is a joint venture through which a state receives most funding from the federal government but must pay a percentage based on the economic health of the state. In North Carolina, our federal Medicaid matching percentage is 68%. The state covers 32% of the cost. 
States administer Medicaid and set provider and hospital payment; these payment rates cannot exceed 100% of the Medicare rates. In 1989, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reduction Act (OBRA 89) which said that Medicaid payment should be sufficient for providers to afford to accept Medicaid patients just as they would patients who have private insurance. Providers have sued state governments because of inadequate Medicaid payment with little success, even though OBRA 89 says that adequate Medicaid payment is the responsibility of the states. 
North Carolina does not currently pay anywhere near the Medicare rates for Medicaid services, and Medicaid fees for providers have not kept up with the increasing cost of living in our economy for a number of years. The only way doctors and hospitals can participate in Medicaid is to generate revenue from patients who have private insurance, since private sector payments average about 130% of the Medicare rates.
In our state, we have seen the the percentage of children covered by Medicaid increase over the past few decades, meaning that it has become increasingly difficult for doctors and hospitals to cover their practice costs like staff salaries and supplies. In particular, rural family physicians, obstetricians, dentists, eye doctors, and pediatricians will be the health professionals who will most likely be forced to turn patients away when these Medicaid cuts reduce cash flow to the breaking point for practice survival. 
Personally, as a pediatrician who has developed a large multi-county “safety net” practice in eastern NC, I worry that we will have to limit our participation in Medicaid and force many of our 25,000+ Medicaid patients to seek care elsewhere – and there are very few options for these children in rural North Carolina.
I hope our General Assembly and Governor Stein understand the seriousness of these new Medicaid cuts for the at-risk low-income children in our state!

(Photo by Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS – Lucia Lopez was leaving St. Alphonsus Parish — her 3-year-old daughter in tow — after participating in the Eucharist adoration on Oct. 30 when her brother-in-law called. Federal immigration agents had arrested her husband, Orlin Lopez Fuentes, he told her.
“I didn’t believe it,” Lucia said in an interview at the church two weeks after he was detained. “I was in shock.”
Orlin, a welder, had been at work at a shipyard in Harvey when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted a large-scale raid capturing dozens of workers — all Honduran citizens.
A press release from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, published days after the arrests, quoted Deputy Special Agent In Charge Matt Wright from the agency’s local Homeland Security Investigations unit, based in New Orleans.
“This operation demonstrates our commitment to enforcing immigration laws and holding employers accountable,” Wright said.
However, the press release did not mention any penalties levied against Orlin’s employer, aside from the loss of laborers.
For Orlin, the greatest penalty was spending a month separated from Lucia and their two daughters Camila, 6, and Angeles, 3, he said in a phone interview Tuesday with Verite News.

“When I was arrested the first thing I thought [of] was my wife and my daughters. We had always been together,” Orlin said. “One of the most painful things you can put a person through is separating them from their family.”
Orlin is one of thousands of people in Louisiana caught in the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement dragnet that, despite its stated goals to prioritize the arrests and deportations of violent criminals, has indiscriminately impacted immigrant families, separating parents from children and splitting spouses apart.
Now, as the New Orleans metro area and the rest of Louisiana brace for the incursion of hundreds of U.S. Border Patrol agents who intend to sweep the region with immigration arrests similar to those seen in Illinois and North Carolina, Orlin, Lucia and their girls are planning to start their lives over in Honduras, where they can be together without fear of being ripped apart again.
Orlin was deported to Honduras on Nov. 22, ICE verified. Lucia said she and their children will soon join him there.
Friends at St. Alphonsus Parish called Orlin, a choir director at the church, a strong leader, who spoke up for Spanish speaking congregants and helped other men strengthen their relationships with God and their families.

Immigration attorney and fellow parishioner Marco Balducci said he felt compelled to help Orlin and his family navigate the immigration legal system. Their wish was “modest,” he said. Orlin hoped he would be released under ICE’s supervision so that they could tie up whatever loose ends they had and return to Honduras together within a few months. They had quickly come to terms with having to leave the U.S. and just wanted to do it as a family, on a normal, commercial flight.
Balducci said he’d try to make what they wished for a reality, but it wasn’t likely. He thought the way Orlin, who has no criminal record, was arrested and detained was not fair.
“Orlin is not somebody who deserves this,” Balducci said. “Given the violence and the force that’s being used both in the apprehension and the detention of people, this is an inappropriate method of immigration enforcement.”
Orlin said he was detained for nearly three weeks at Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center, a privately run detention facility in Evangeline Parish that, according to immigration data researchers calculations, has been operating well above its contractual capacity of 500 detainees for most of 2025. He shared a room that had four bunk beds with 13 other people – eight men slept in the beds. The other six or so, including Orlin, slept on mattresses on the floor, Orlin said. He was given an orange uniform, more than a week into his detention, he said. Before that, he had been wearing the clothes he was arrested in. He said he never received an extra change of clothes, including underwear, confirming what other recent detainees at the facility have reported. He would shower and then put the same clothes back on. Maybe that, he wondered, was why he broke out in rashes. Or maybe it was the blankets; they were made of a “weird” material, he said. Or maybe it was the tap water, which had a taste that Orlin likened to dirty toilet water.
Verite News contacted ICE for comment on the circumstances of Orlin’s detention and conditions at Pine Prarie, but the agency did not respond in time for publication.
Christopher Ferreira, director of corporate relations at Geo Group, the private prison corporation that owns and operates Pine Prairie said the company “rejects these allegations, which are meant to criticize the quality of our services,” in an emailed statement.
Ferreira said Pine Prairie issues all detainees two uniforms, two pairs of underwear, two pairs of socks and one pair of shoes at intake, adding that the company follows ICE’s detention standards.


Let us know what you think...


 


Orlin requested voluntary departure — a request to leave within a set time frame and at his own expense — which an immigration judge granted. But he wasn’t released. Balducci explained that the grant from the judge acknowledges that he’d chosen to close his case and leave on his own. It didn’t mean he would actually be released. Instead of leaving with his family, Orlin said, he was deported in handcuffs and shackles, with chains hanging from his chest and waist, for 10 hours, including the flight from Alexandria International Airport (in Central Louisiana) to Honduras.
“I think it was one of the worst experiences for me because I have never lived through being treated like that,” Orlin said. “They treated us like we were criminals and we really were just people who had a dream.”
Orlin said their dream was to make sure Camila lived. According to Lucia, Camila was only 52 days old when she and Orlin carried her across Mexico’s border with Texas. Lucia had given birth to two daughters before Camila, but they’d both died — one as a toddler and the other as an infant — of respiratory complications that the couple associated with air pollution from the cement factory in their town, Piedras Azules , where Orlin worked. They’d taken the second child to Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, for specialized care. When she died, they lost faith in Honduras’ healthcare system.
Lucia said they would never have come to the United States if she hadn’t had Camila. But once she was born, they couldn’t imagine enduring the death of another child.

Since Orlin’s arrest, Camila has suffered from anxiety. She had to be picked up from school one day after a teacher called because she would not stop crying, Lucia said.
“She’s worried that the same thing that happened to her dad is gonna happen to me,” Lucia said in a phone interview on Tuesday. “She’s really traumatized by immigration. She doesn’t ever want to be alone.”
Now, Camila prays for the family to leave their home in Harvey, where, in anticipation of the upcoming Border Patrol sweeps, drones have been spotted hovering over the neighborhood, Lucia said. Her prayers will be answered by the end of the week.

Lucia has mixed feelings about returning home after six years. She’s happy her daughters will get to know life in Honduras, but she worries about difficulties with finding work and transportation there. And while she’ll be reunited with her mother and a sibling in Honduras, her daughters are being separated from their cousins here in the U.S.
Orlin’s work as a welder allowed them to save enough money to buy a house in Honduras. Lucia said she’s looking forward to making it a home. Orlin is hopeful that the family can “have peace” there.
Orlin said starting a new life back home can be “something beautiful.” He shared a parting message for other Hispanic immigrants “that want to keep trying for their dream in the U.S.”
“What I lived through is something that I wouldn’t wish on anyone,” he said. “Take care of yourselves, be careful, try to protect yourselves because things are getting pretty bad.”

Housing Hub Colorado — a collaboration between several state agencies, the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority, and Denver’s Department of Housing Stability — aligns application timelines and information for different entities that offer funding to developers building affordable rental housing. 
“Colorado is breaking down barriers to more housing people can afford and this one-stop shop will help make that possible in more communities across our state,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said in a statement. “This effort will save people, and local communities, time and money when building new homes in Colorado.”

State agencies supporting the project include the Department of Local Affairs and the Office of Economic Development and International Trade. Funding sources for affordable housing come from the state’s local affairs department and Denver’s housing stability department.
“A strong economy depends on good-paying jobs and housing Coloradans can afford,” Eve Lieberman, executive director of the economic development office, said in a statement. “By simplifying the process of applying for funding, we are reducing time and cost burdens for communities and developers and accelerating the creation of homes near jobs and industry.”










Colorado is breaking down barriers to more housing people can afford and this one-stop shop will help make that possible in more communities across our state.


– Colorado Gov. Jared Polis


The Housing Hub is the first initiative to come from the Colorado Housing Consortium, a collaboration between over 100 entities in the private and public sectors looking to accelerate more affordable housing development in the state. 
A survey of those who applied for affordable housing tax credits in the last two years found that 85% of respondents wanted to see a statewide application to improve the process of applying for funding, according to a press release from Polis’ office. Applying through multiple funding sources dragged on build timelines and put affording housing projects at risk, according to 65% of survey respondents.  
“There is no greater need in Denver and Colorado than affordable housing, and no greater obstacle to our success than time,” Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said in a statement.
A second phase of the project will include a common application accepted by all agencies.
Polis has made “More Housing Now” a key goal throughout his second term as governor. Demographers estimate Colorado needs about 100,000 more units to meet the housing demand in the state.

(Courtesy photo)Parkersburg, West Virginia native, Reed Byers, believes that a small gesture, offered at the right moment, can cut through the kind of loneliness many people carry but often struggle to name. In West Virginia, where isolation is common and connection frequently feels like something one must earn, he learned early what it meant to grow up without the safety nets other places take for granted. So when a stranger wrapped him in a hug one morning at a Tudor’s Biscuit World in Huntington — no questions, no judgment — it landed with a force he couldn’t shake.
That moment didn’t solve anything outright, but it reframed something for Byers. After years of addiction, loss and rebuilding, he’d been carrying the quiet weight familiar to so many Americans, and particularly Appalachians, who navigate their hardest days alone. The simple act of someone pulling him in — just long enough to feel seen — became the seed of an idea he couldn’t ignore.
Today, that idea has taken shape as #1BillionHugs, a community-rooted effort built around human contact, mental health and the kind of everyday grace that rarely makes headlines. What started as a T-shirt with a catchy slogan has begun to spread across the state and beyond, carried by people who understand the power of a gesture that asks for nothing in return. And in a region where the struggle can be both connection and the chance to build a life that feels possible, Byers is betting that something as small and unguarded as a hug might change the way people feel about themselves, their neighbors, and the place they call home.

Full circles being what they are, Byers’ life didn’t follow a straight line. Born in Marietta, Ohio, he spent his early childhood in Parkersburg, where his father worked at a plant and his mother earned a nursing degree. 
“Before 13, I had a pretty decent childhood,” he said. “Yes, there was domestic violence and drug use, but when they were present, when they weren’t consumed with that, they were pretty good parents. I was involved in rec sports and extracurriculars and academic stuff, and I had clothes on my back.”
Everything shifted when the family broke apart. A volatile divorce sent him to North Carolina for several years — deepening the instability. His mother left the family for a drug dealer, falling deeper into addiction, and his father didn’t know how to cope. 
“Next thing you know, my brother’s 17 and catching a felony for trafficking weed. And here I am, watching all this happen at 13.”
Byers was the last in his immediate family to start using drugs — at 13. 
“It was sort of part of our family culture,” he said. 
He returned to West Virginia during high school, moving to St. Marys with his father. They smoked marijuana together until Byers realized he needed something different.
“I wanted to go to college. I was in youth leadership programs. I was on an academic team, a science bowl team. I really wanted to make a difference — pursue academic endeavors — but my lifestyle, family life, wasn’t really conducive to that.”
So Byers staged his own intervention — moving out, living with an aunt and finally landing in a small community outreach apartment where staff let him stay if he promised to attend school. 
“Which I did,” he said. “I was the first immediate sibling to graduate high school.” 
After graduation, he tried to cling to the few positive influences in his life, working briefly at Camp Horseshoe, where he’d seen a glimpse of structure and purpose.
College came next — West Virginia Wesleyan — though it didn’t last. Dropping out left him adrift. 
“I fell into the bar scene, eventually getting diagnosed with a mental illness, ending up homeless,” he said. “This pattern continued over the next four years in my early 20s — homelessness, mental illness, onset drug use.” 

The spiral deepened until, at 24, he was arrested in Ohio. 
“You go from smoking weed at 13 to trafficking meth at 24”

Called to create
Prison became the hard stop he never saw coming. And yet, even there, someone showed up for him.
“The only person that came and visited me at Noble Correctional Institution was my mentor, David King — the director of Camp Horseshoe in the Youth Leadership Association,” Byers said — noting that King had believed in him long before he believed in himself. “He used to drop off canned goods and books on the porch of the boarding house when I was in high school. This guy genuinely believed in me, saw potential in me. He came to my graduation and gave me “The Purpose Driven Life.”
In prison, King pushed Byers to see possibility. 
“He saw something in me that I didn’t see. He said, no, you’ve got a purpose. You see what’s not working. You’ve witnessed people around you lose their lives, take their lives, give it away and you’ve chosen your health instead.” 
Together, they sketched out the framework that would anchor Byers’ return to the world: a four-page plan of action: mind, spirit, body, relationships.
Upon returning home in 2020, Byers felt something unfamiliar — clarity. 
“I thought, I’ve really put my health together. I’d lost 60 pounds. I’d started working out and running. What do I want to do with my life?” The answer arrived quickly. “I wanted to be helpful. That was the answer.”
Byers took a job as a youth peer supporter at Westbrook Health Services — the same agency where he’d once been a patient. However, while the work was meaningful, he discovered the system wasn’t built for someone like him.
“Organizationally, the systems that exist that we’ve created are not meeting all of the needs in the communities,” he said. “You hired me to make a difference because of my lived experience, but now my lived experience is becoming a barrier.” 

Byers wasn’t allowed into high schools or the Boys & Girls Club because of his background. 
“These kids are often the ones going home to the harshest environments — sometimes wanting to take their own lives. We were receiving grant money from the state to solve these problems, but you’re telling me no.”
And so he left, determined to build something outside the limits of existing structures. He created a youth recovery initiative called How to Save a Life, developed programming, built an advisory team, raised funds, and was close to a $50,000 pilot. But still, something felt misaligned. 
“Even working underneath an existing nonprofit wasn’t the best fit because I’m called to go and build my own thing. I can work well with people. I just think I’m called to create and not necessarily fit inside of a container.”
Byers pivoted again — this time into a new identity. 
“I ended up opening a business as a motivational speaker,” he said. “I’ve been operating that for over three years now — it’s been very successful.” 

He’s spoken to mental health organizations, high school assemblies, civic groups, health departments, universities and tens of thousands online. His message is simple and relentless: Recovery is possible. Yes, you can do it. Take care of your mind, spirit, body. And we are all responsible in our community for affecting the change that we believe in. Nobody’s coming to save us.

 More than a brand

At this point in his life, two things stand out most for Byers when thinking about West Virginia: the depth of its people and the limits of opportunity. 
“It doesn’t seem like there’s ever enough resources,” he said. 
In his attempts to crack the code, Byers has served on nonprofit boards, built volunteer movements, run for office, and eventually held a seat on the Cabell County Board of Education. 
“Our budget was $150 million and we still couldn’t pay our teachers enough to not want go to Ohio or Kentucky or Virginia,” he indicated. “To me, that’s unacceptable.”
So he asked himself what most people in his position eventually ask: What can I do that actually changes anything? He was already speaking professionally, consulting with nonprofits, and stepping into places where lived experience and clarity carried weight. But he wanted something bigger than speeches and incremental change.
“What if I started a business and found a real way to drive revenue that we could then invest in our region to solve the same social challenges I’ve been trying to solve for five years?” he said. “Mental health, suicide, addiction, recovery, lack of economic opportunity, poor health metrics, obesity, et cetera. How do we solve this holistic slew of social challenges in a simple and focused way through a business?”
The answer came in a way he didn’t expect. 
“God put it on my heart that we could do that through essentially selling ‘Free Hugs’ T-shirts,” he said. “But the movement is so much bigger than that.”
What emerged was #1BillionHugs — not an apparel line, but a human-scale intervention. 
“The endeavor came to mind as a way to promote this wearable symbol of hope,” Byers said. “To catalyze connection with individuals and, in that connected moment, to be a reason that people want to stay on this planet.”
He knows exactly what that moment can do. 
“I was wearing a Free Hugs T-shirt years ago, and I had wanted to take my life. I showed up at a Tudor’s Biscuit World to kind of self-medicate with food. And a woman behind the counter was jumping up and down pointing at her chest, and I realized she was motioning at the front of my shirt. So I said, ‘Come on out here.’ And she gave me a big-old hug. She said, ‘You don’t know how bad I needed that.’ And I told her I needed it too.”
He sat down afterward, still shaken, and another couple approached him. 
“They said, ‘We really appreciate you wearing that shirt.’ And I knew in that moment it was more than just a shirt. I was showing up imperfect, hadn’t shaved, hadn’t showered, had been in bed for a couple days — I knew that I was good enough to make a difference. And in that moment of connection, I didn’t want to take my life anymore.”
For Byers, that was the blueprint. 
“This isn’t like building an apparel brand,” he said. “This is a movement to get a billion people hugging more — to create a billion reasons to stay on this planet. Because if a billion people are engaged in connection, you’re going to have less suicide, improved mental health, improved psyche and rapport in your communities. You’re going to take better care of your physical health, have increased economic opportunities, increased collaboration.”

Further proof
When Byers first imagined #1BillionHugs as an actual brand, the vision arrived all at once. 
“I thought, wow, you can count hugs essentially by people using the hashtag,” he said. “Which made me think about scale. What does that mean, a billion hugs? What would it take to get there? Maybe you have a hug counter. Maybe selling a billion shirts will also help you get there.”

His own willingness to learn became the driving force. 
“I also had to ask myself if I was willing to commit my life to it,” he said. “Was I willing to keep going until we get to a billion and this becomes my life’s work?” 
Ultimately, an injury forced him to slow down — and build. 
“I blew my knee out and I had to sit down,” he said. “Thankfully, having surgery allowed me to get to work on the website.”

A collection of different designers finally got the logo to his liking. The first shirt design emerged. 
“I was consulting with people in my network for six months.” 

The first pre-order was printed through Mountain Mindful at Coalfield Development, but Byers quickly realized he needed a different long-term partner. A chance meeting with a local pastor introduced him to a young Marshall student running his own print shop.
Soon after, the website launched in August. And the response was immediate. 
“We did 117 units in our four-week pre-order,” he added. “We had so much response from the press — a TV commercial, a segment on WSAZ, a couple different press publications. I spoke on a global mental wellness summit. Boys & Girls Club published our release. I got to speak at the West Virginia Goes Purple Fest. We’ve had so many hug ambassadors and people supporting the movement, and we’re not even three months in.”
Further proof, for Byers, that the need is real. 
“People are hungry for connection. People want to support organizations like the Boys & Girls Club and the Youth Leadership Association — where 10% of our proceeds go to.”
All the while, he knows that pace is the lesson. 
“Rome wasn’t built in a day. Nike did $6,000 in their first year. Twenty thousand in their second. I’m confident we’re going to do better than both of those numbers. But we don’t expect a billion in a year. I’ve learned to move at a sustainable pace versus all-or-nothing.”
Operationally, #1BillionHugs is obviously quite young, but the movement has already spread farther than Byers expected. “That first four-week pre-order went all over the nation,” he said. 

Most of the early response has come through online marketing and the Shopify store that feeds directly into the website. There, supporters can track their own hugs on the site’s counters, join a Facebook group where people share photos and stories, and contribute to a business page that is approaching its first thousand followers.
Byers has also assembled what he calls “hug hustlers” — brand ambassadors who help sell shirts, give hugs and spread the message. 
“We do accept applications for new hug hustlers,” he said. “We do want to engage with volunteers. We’re working on how that can be more formal and streamlined, because it’s mostly just me right now in terms of managing the operations.”

A new story 
Byers is building the kind of partnerships he believes will ground the movement in communities. 
“I’ve met with nine pastors — trying to figure out how the message fits with churches,” he said — while simultaneously thinking carefully about how to involve schools in the future. “I’ve been hesitant to introduce it directly into schools so far, just because of the physical consent piece. You don’t want to spark anything that’s inappropriate, but you do want the kids to know that they’re loved, welcomed, and valued.”
The project donates 10% of its proceeds to charity partners — the Boys & Girls Club and the Youth Leadership Association — and Byers sent each a check recently.
“It’s $150 to each of those organizations — so $300 total we’ve donated just from August. It’s not a ton of money, but for me, as a person who came from tough circumstances, from the streets, no shoes, it means a lot. It shows me the vehicle that I was led to create, that people invested in, is producing fruit.”
As for explaining how #1BillionHugs fits into Appalachia, Byers doesn’t hesitate. 
“This state, region, all of it — we have our different social challenges, but there is a massive amount of social capital. Kindness.”
He’s seen it everywhere he goes. “It’s challenging for me to go anywhere in the state and not see somebody that I know,” he said — admitting that wearing the shirt opens new connections instantly — sometimes with people he didn’t realize he already shared community with. 
“Like the day I hugged a stranger who turned out to be the new director of the West Virginia Community Development Hub.”
Ultimately, Byers affirmed, Appalachia is where the idea emerged, and where the need feels most urgent. 
“My family has been plagued by mental illness and addiction,” he said. “I’ve lost a number of people who are very close to me — my brother, my mother, my best friend. Several of my classmates in high school to suicide and addiction. This place is where the idea met me and where its biggest and greatest impact will be carried out.”

Accordingly, he finds proof of concept wherever he goes. 
“People will share their stories, their personal connection to addiction, their personal connection to mental illness — to suicide,” he said. “I’m continuously amazed by what comes up when I just wear these shirts and live out the mission.” 
Among his greatest challenges at this point is a lack of personnel. 
“I’m extroverted by nature — and not having a fortified enough internal team or system to brainstorm and hash these ideas out has been tough,” he said. “And I can admit an occasional lack of emotional or mental fortitude in terms of being able to live out this dream optimally. But the greater point is that I continue showing up.”
For Byers, the future depends on him showing up. And when he pictures success five or 10 years down the road, it’s not about a number on a hug counter. 
“It goes beyond that,” he said. “I see the young people that look like I once did — on the west side of Charleston, or Parkersburg, or up in the hills of Preston County. The ones who need loving, caring, supportive adults. And because they might not have access to that, they’re ending up on the wrong path.”
Success, to him, is both simple and sophisticated. “It’s about being a presence in those areas and many more like them — seeing how all of the young people are supported and cared for. So they don’t have to go down the same path I did, which led to incarceration. So they don’t end up lonely, isolated or taking their lives like so many of my friends have.”
Byers describes #1BillionHugs as the front end of a comprehensive effort. 
“We get people hugging, we sell the merchandise, we create the revenue, and we invest that back into Appalachia,” he said. “If it works, the region becomes something people haven’t seen in generations. Appalachia becomes a beacon of hope. Where people want to move, want to stay, where people aren’t in despair, and where people are healing and healed and sharing that healing with others.”
To see that happen, to help build it, Byers said, “… is how I would define success.”

(Photo courtesy of Jake Lowenstern/USGS)Today, Mars is a cold and dry planet with a very thin, low-pressure atmosphere. It has water, but it’s all frozen, locked up in underground ice (like permafrost) and in polar ice caps.
But billions of years ago Mars had a thicker atmosphere and a warmer and wetter climate. It also used to have active volcanoes. So, with all that heat, and all that water, is it possible that there were once hot springs on Mars? And how could we find out?
Mars has been a fascination for centuries, with early telescopic observations and fantastically speculative (and as it turns out, fictional) stories about possible canals and intelligent life forms. Modern Mars exploration began in the 1960s with spacecraft flybys, then in the following decades with orbiters, landers and finally robotic rovers.
There are currently seven active spacecraft orbiting Mars and two robotic “geologists” roving the surface, named Curiosity and Perseverance.
With all the images and data collected by these satellites and robotic explorers, we now have a good idea of what Mars is like on the surface.
There is no evidence for canals or complex lifeforms, but there is plenty of evidence for active surface processes, like wind, dust devils, migrating sand dunes and landslides. There is also evidence for past volcanism, such as large volcanoes and lava flows, and evidence for past flowing liquid water, such as river channels and delta deposits.
The evidence for past liquid water also includes a variety of hydrated minerals, hydrothermal alteration minerals, and silica deposits. It’s the silica deposits, discovered in 2007 by the Mars Exploration Rover, Spirit, that make you sit up and say, “Wow! Like in Yellowstone?”
Most of the silica deposits in Yellowstone are made of a white, lightweight, porous rock composed of opaline silica. The silica is dissolved from the rhyolitic volcanic rocks below and picked up by the hydrothermal fluids circulating underground.
When the hot, silica-rich fluids reach the surface, they cool down and precipitate layered silica deposits and mounds, called sinter, around geysers and hot springs.
There is also another way to get silica-rich deposits: acid-sulfate leaching. This is where sulfuric acid from volcanic gases reacts with the surrounding silicate rocks near the surface, leaching (removing) metal compounds, like iron and magnesium, and leaving a residue of opaline silica.
On Mars, silica deposits were found adjacent to a site dubbed Home Plate, within a large impact crater called Gusev crater, and there is evidence they formed from hydrothermal fluids. A key observation is the association of the silica deposits with volcanic activity.
The Home Plate feature represents the remains of volcanic ash deposits, which, along with nearby basaltic rocks, demonstrates that this place had magmatic activity capable of generating a hydrothermal system, although much smaller than the one that drives Yellowstone’s hot springs and fumaroles.
Because sinter deposits on Earth often host microbial life, they are a key target in the search for evidence of ancient microbial life on Mars. Excitingly, the silica deposits discovered by Spirit display tiny fingerlike structures that resemble features of Yellowstone sinter and other sinter deposits on Earth that are referred to as stromatolites, which form by a combination of biology and geology.
The colorful microbial communities that inhabit the edges and outflow channels of hot springs contribute to the growth of stromatolites along with the silica that precipitates from the water. The fingerlike structures observed by Spirit are made of silica, but they have not been shown to include organic matter and may not be equivalent to hot spring stromatolites on Earth.
At this point, they are assumed to have formed from geologic processes alone.

Image modified from Ruff et al., 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1089/ast.2019.2044).
Still, understanding microorganisms that inhabit Yellowstone’s hot springs, and the evidence they leave behind, could help answer some fundamental questions in the field of astrobiology: Is there, or has there ever been, life elsewhere in the solar system?
Going beyond Mars, there is also evidence of geyser activity on some of the icy moons in the outer solar system, such as Neptune’s moon, Triton, and Saturn’s moon, Enceladus. Jupiter’s moon, Europa, is another outer solar system body that has a liquid water ocean underneath its crust of water ice and may host geysers that are spurting out samples of this water.
In October 2024, NASA launched the Europa Clipper mission to investigate. It will arrive in 2030. Stay tuned.
Yellowstone is not just a natural laboratory for Earth science studies. With its history of caldera-forming volcanism, geothermal activity, geysers, hydrothermal mineral deposits, and thermophilic bacteria, it is also an excellent laboratory for exciting planetary science research.

CENTRAL CITY — As Gwen Clements walks through the building where her fledgling nonprofit is making its home, she sees the work that’s still ahead. 
The corroded electrical wiring inside the small building along Everly Brothers Boulevard needs to be replaced. Ceiling panels are drooping. Signs among the racks of clothes and toiletries still point to where customers could once shop for pumps and filters at the former pool supply store. 
“A little disheartened,” said Clements when asked by a first-time visitor how she was feeling about the place on a recent November afternoon. “But we’ll get there.” 
She also says they’ve come a long way. 
The Lantern reported earlier this year about Clements’ efforts in Muhlenberg County in the series “No Kentucky Home.” Clements started a Facebook group in 2024 that helped bring together people seeking to provide money, food, shelter and other support for their neighbors experiencing homelessness. That loose coalition has now become the Breakthrough Base of Muhlenberg County, a nonprofit formed in May. Clements serves as its vice president. 
The goal: Create a resource hub where people experiencing homelessness can get a hot meal, a shower, do some laundry and get help with paperwork to get an I.D. card. There’s no shower installed yet, nor a kitchen space — but they have a building. Clements previously said she was inspired by another nonprofit in Somerset that’s become a shelter and hub for homeless people. 
Donna Vincent, middle, is one of a number of people experiencing homelessness that the Breakthrough Base of Muhlenberg County has helped so far. Vincent has been sleeping in her car. Cyndi Aday, left, and Gwen Clements, right, stand next to her.
She said the official nonprofit, which is leasing the building in Central City, has gotten more support from the community than when it was an unofficial group organizing through Facebook. She felt, in the past, local homeless people were met with apathy, or at times disregard, from local officials. The work of the nonprofit has “been welcomed.” 
“Everybody says this is such a needed program, that what we’re doing is such a needed thing in Muhlenberg County,” Clements said. “That feels good. Because two years ago, a year ago — I didn’t feel that way.”
Local people experiencing homelessness who were at the building on this recent November day say the nonprofit is providing resources that haven’t been available in their Western Kentucky county, along with a community space where they can exist without apprehension.
‘A place to just be’
The nonprofit has volunteers, clothing, food, and appliances — but it still likely needs thousands of dollars for renovations. That’s why Breakthrough Base was raffling off an expensive hunting bow, offering donated chili from the nearby Wendy’s and giving away winter clothes on a November weekend to try to meet the gap. The 501(c)(3) nonprofit has also been gathering donations through online accounts with PayPal, Venmo and Cash App.on their Facebook page.

“Being able to come up here, it helps. It keeps you out of your head,” Luenebrink said, mentioning she had been seeing a therapist from the Pennyroyal Center inside the building. “They got big hearts to do something like this, to get it off the ground.” 
The building, with its blemishes, is also becoming a community space for local homeless people.
Cyndi Aday, the nonprofit’s food director, said that on some mornings volunteers have pulled up and found  people sitting outside “just waiting for us to open.” Sometimes it’s raining with no place to go outside of their tents, she said, so they come to the storefront. 
“They just hang out,” Aday said. “It gives them a place to just be.” 
Even though the hours of operation are limited to a few in the middle of the day, Aday said she tries to stay longer to talk with the people they’re helping. It helps build relationships, she said, and it gives them something to do.
Some of those in need of shelter pitch in to help with tasks around the building, said Clements. “They feel productive, and they feel like they’re doing something that matters.”
The community space — and the outreach from it —  also give the new nonprofit the opportunity to connect with more people in the homeless community, including those who are ashamed to show up at the building but instead contact Clements personally. 
“They’re afraid to reach out. They’re afraid to be judged. I tell them, ‘There’s no judgment with us,’” Clements said. “That’s the hidden homelessness.” 
The work before winter
In the back of the building is a cavernous garage that was once filled with pool liners and other supplies and is now an empty concrete floor. What Clements imagines it could be: a “white flag” or overnight warming shelter for when temperatures are dangerously cold and people need to move inside to stay safe.
The wooden roof has water damage that needs repair, Clements said, along with a space needing insulation. Clements isn’t entirely confident they can get the space ready for the upcoming winter. 
The converted storefront is next door to the Central Inn, a motel where Clements and others have rented rooms — with crowdfunded money raised through her Facebook group — for people experiencing homelessness during cold weather. 
“I just didn’t want to do another winter of motel rooms, and it’s already looking like that’s where we’re at,” Clements said.

She’s not sure if her community, the place where she grew up, would support a more comprehensive emergency shelter that would operate year-round as some are operating in other parts of the state. Clements also feels that much of her community’s challenge with rural homelessness would be alleviated by building and repairing more affordable housing in Muhlenberg County.
Kentucky’s housing shortage
Kentucky is grappling with a significant housing shortage in both urban and rural communities; the gap of more than 200,000 housing units is expected to grow if no action is taken. A national research firm had estimated Muhlenberg County, with a little over 30,000 people, had a housing gap of 952 units in 2024. State lawmakers have been looking at ways to build more housing through easing regulations and providing tax breaks for housing developers.
KY task force recommends easing regulation, more funding to address housing shortage

“We need permanent housing solutions and we need a better crisis response system across the board,” said Adrienne Bush, executive director of the advocacy group Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky. She praised efforts to prevent people from dying during extreme weather as well as a year-round approach of connecting people to housing.
The number of people experiencing homelessness across the state has also grown. The annual nationwide survey tracked a more than a 10% increase in people experiencing homelessness in Kentucky from January 2024 to January 2025. The steepest increase was outside Lexington and Louisville. Volunteers and agency outreach workers counted 5,789 individuals who lacked “a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence,” the federal definition of homeless used for the survey.
The survey counted eight people experiencing homelessness in Muhlenberg County in January 2025. Clements, who helped with the count, believes that number is higher. Her nonprofit plans to start keeping detailed demographic records of each person they help to better exemplify the local need when asking for grant funding. 
She said it’s that need for funding that is holding the nonprofit back. But that hasn’t stopped them. 
“As far as helping people, we are helping them. We are helping them every day. We have a lot of contacts every day with different people, and sometimes they just need some information” about helpful agencies, Clements said. 
Clements feels a responsibility to see the efforts of the nonprofit through, feeling more responsibility now that a part of the loose coalition helping others has moved into the storefront. She also worries about the precedent that could be set. 
“We have got to succeed. We can’t fail,” Clements said. “If we fail, there’ll never be anything else to come about to help the people in Muhlenberg County, the unfortunate people.”

(Getty Images)A multi-million dollar proposal designed to rehabilitate Pennsylvania’s aging housing stock failed to receive funding in the state’s 2025-2026 budget — marking the third year without a state-funded successor to the popular Whole Home Repair Program.
Sen. Nikil Saval (D-Philadelphia) said that the thousands of Pennsylvanians on waitlists across the state “vastly understates the need,” since many counties closed theirs after distributing funds.
“We know that there is immense demand for the home repair program,” Saval told the Capital-Star. 
Saval and Sen. David Argall (R-Schuylkill) sponsored the bill to create the PA Home Preservation Program in the Senate, while a trio of bipartisan House lawmakers introduced its companion bill in their chamber. The House version passed 122-80, only to stall in the Senate along with Saval’s effort. 
Gov. Josh Shapiro earmarked $50 million for the state program in his proposed budget, but the request quietly disappeared after a monthslong impasse that concluded earlier this month.

“Our best guess is that there were a lot of funding priorities in this budget and when it came to coming up with the funding number, they did not find money for this program,” said Saval. “Frankly, they didn’t find money for virtually any housing program, and that’s really unfortunate given the nature and scale of the housing crisis.” 
A similar, federal effort dubbed the ROAD to Housing Bill is still moving as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed the U.S. Senate in October. The Whole-Home Repairs Act under that proposal would allow the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to establish a five-year pilot program to offer grants and forgivable loans to low- and moderate-income homeowners alongside qualified landlords. 
 Program details

Only a sliver of the 17,000 applicants — 3,965 homeowners — got a share of the $125 million Whole Home Repairs Program’s funding, according to the state Department of Community and Economic Development.
Just three counties have spent all of their program funds before the Jan. 31, 2026 deadline: Bradford, Cameron and McKean. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Cliff Clark, the director of Cameron County Community and Economic Development, oversaw how the $200,000 awarded to his county was spent. He said the funding quickly went to four homes on an existing housing repair list maintained by the county. 
“Our housing stock is old. That’s not to say it’s deteriorated, but it’s old,” said Clark. “One of our goals is to try to improve the housing stock … we’re doing, I think, a very good job making houses that aren’t otherwise marketable, desirable.” 
The program limited individual home projects to $50,000, a number Clark said could be higher if a similar effort is approved on the state level. For example, he noted a new boiler for some homes could cost as much as $20,000.
“Costs have increased so much that we’re only able to do about half of the homes we used to be able to do. I used to do 10 to 12 homes a year and now I’m doing about five. So if you’re number 50 on my waiting list, you’ve got a 10-year wait,” said Clark. 
Part of the bottleneck in the county is due to a shortage of contractors, Clark said, which is a statewide problem meant to be addressed with workforce development funds. Under Whole Home Repair, $4.9 million has been spent on scholarships, training programs and more.
Tom Stark, speaking on behalf of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania, told the Capital-Star workforce development was a difficult component for many counties, particularly those that didn’t have existing workforce programs. 
“With the trades, in general, finding workforce in a timely fashion and getting a contractor out there to actually conduct the work?” Stark said. “There aren’t as many out there as there used to be.”
 What other funding is out there?

Prior to Whole Home Repair, Stark said counties had access to a variety of different assistance programs — both state and federal. He highlighted the commonwealth’s Weatherization Assistance Program as one used to make homes more energy efficient. 
For example, replacing windows under the initiative was a popular use of funds, but had its shortcomings.
“The challenge is if you go to a home and they need a window repair, but you know they need a roof first, there really wasn’t funding for that,” Stark said. “Whole Homes came in to fill that gap.”
He said that funds for landlords were “underutilized,” noting the additional requirements. To qualify for a forgivable loan of up to $50,000, landlords must own no more than five properties and no more than 15 rental units.
The unit’s current tenant must also get a three-year lease extension and annual rent increases cannot exceed 3%. In addition to owning the unit for at least 15 years, landlords must not have any serious code violations during that time. 
 


				By the numbers:
Roughly $3.7 million, or 3%, of the initial $125 million allocation went to the state for administrative costs, leaving $121.3 million to be distributed to counties, according to the state Department of Community and Economic Development.
Of that $121.3 million, $89.6 million has been committed to the following categories:

$75.7 million in homeowner grants (including small landlords)
$5.9 million on provision and enhancement 
$3.2 million on county-level administrative costs
$4.9 million on workforce development

 



Clark said Cameron County also receives grant funding from HUD’s HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which allocates billions of dollars for affordable housing across the nation. HOME can cover housing repairs, but restricts some repairs on homes in floodplains and requires an environmental review. 
The Whole Homes Repair program had neither restriction, Clark said, nor did it enforce HUD’s minimum standards for repairs — a benchmark Clark said he still followed for his county’s projects and believed should be implemented for others.
Overall, he called the WHRP “a very easy program to administer” and an “economic driver” for his community. 
“We get $200,000 and all of that money goes right back into the economy,” he said. “We hire local contractors and I’d say probably 80% to 90% of supplies are purchased locally as well.”
The state’s proposed home preservation program could become more important if federal funding gets cut. The Trump administration has proposed zeroing out funding for the HOME program, meaning that communities could miss out on funds for future repairs or affordable housing initiatives.
While the current state fiscal year finally has a spending plan, the 2026-2027 state budget process is already underway as the Office of the Budget reviews agency budget requests for the coming year, with the next budget address scheduled for early February.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gettyimages-1456256926-1024x6831741861210-1.jpg,,,2025-12-01 05:56:42.597460

(Photo courtesy of Lake Cumberland Somerset-Pulaski Tourism)For the first time in living memory, families leaving Eastern Kentucky’s coalfield counties are more likely to resettle in Somerset or London than Cincinnati or Detroit. The Hillbilly Highway that once carried millions north has given way to a profoundly local pattern of movement — short hops between Kentucky counties rather than the exodus that once defined Appalachia.
The shift is visible in tax return data: Between 2021 and 2022, roughly 3 out of every 4 people who moved from Eastern Kentucky stayed within state borders. In some counties, the figure reached 90%
This represents a historic reversal. During the 1950s and 1960s, two-thirds of all moves out of Eastern Kentucky crossed state lines, bound for factory towns in Ohio, Michigan, and Illinois. Today, the same proportion stays home.
The new migration map: Staying close, moving often
The latest migration statistics from the Internal Revenue Service — which tracks household addresses through annual tax filings  — reveal Eastern Kentucky’s transformation from a region of exodus to one of circulation.
Analysis of the 2021-22 data for 10 Eastern Kentucky counties shows that when residents move, they overwhelmingly relocate nearby. These are intra-Kentucky migration rates for 2021-22.

Knott County: 90% stayed in Kentucky
Breathitt County: 90% stayed in Kentucky
Perry County: 77% stayed in Kentucky
Laurel County: 77% stayed in Kentucky
Floyd County: 75% stayed in Kentucky
Letcher County: 64% stayed in Kentucky
Harlan County: 62% stayed in Kentucky
Pulaski County: 63% stayed in Kentucky
Pike County: 54% stayed in Kentucky
Bell County: 46% stayed in Kentucky

Even Pike County — Kentucky’s easternmost and once among its most outmigration-heavy counties — now sends more than half its departing households to other Kentucky destinations rather than out of state.
Two counties actually growing
While most Eastern Kentucky counties continue to lose population, two regional hubs have reversed course entirely. Pulaski and Laurel counties — home to Somerset and London, respectively — posted net migration gains in 2021-22.
Laurel and Pulaski counties gained population in 2021-22. Note: “People” is calculated from tax exemptions; represents approximate individual migration. (Source: IRS Statistics of Income, County-to-County Migration Data, 2021-2022. )
What makes Pulaski and Laurel attractive? Both sit along Interstate 75, Kentucky’s economic spine. Both have regional medical centers — Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital in Somerset, Saint Joseph London — that serve as major employers. Both host community college campuses. And both offer what demographers call “amenity migration” — access to retail, restaurants, broadband internet and proximity to the region without its remoteness.
Pike County tells a different story. While it posted a net loss of 187 households, the data reveals significant churn: 680 households moved in even as 867 moved out. Unlike the one-way departures of the 1950s, Pike now functions as part of a regional circulation system, drawing workers from neighboring Floyd and Letcher counties while sending residents to Lexington’s Fayette County for education and specialized employment.
Why the pattern changed
Several forces explain the shift from exodus to local circulation:

Economic collapse of the industrial Midwest. The auto plants, tire factories and steel mills that once pulled Appalachians north have largely closed. Rust Belt cities no longer promise prosperity; many former migrants have returned as retirees or disability recipients.
Regional health care consolidation. As rural hospitals close, residents must relocate to maintain access to medical care, but they move to the nearest hub with a hospital, not to another state.
The power of proximity. Extended family networks remain paramount in Appalachian culture. Even struggling economically, residents prefer to stay within visiting distance of parents, siblings and grandchildren.
Digital infrastructure. Improved broadband access in counties like Pulaski has enabled white-collar workers to live in small towns while working remotely for employers based elsewhere—a pandemic-era pattern that persists.
Interstate 75 and I-64. Kentucky’s two major interstates have created development corridors that capture migration within the state. Families leaving remote hollows now stop in London or Somerset rather than continuing north.

The great exodus: 1950-1980
To understand how dramatic today’s inward turn is, consider what came before.
Between 1950 and 1970, approximately 3 million people left the Appalachian region — one of the largest peacetime internal migrations in American history. Eastern Kentucky bore disproportionate losses.
Between 1950 and 1980, four coalfield counties lost approximately 105,000 residents—more than 40% of their population. (Source: U.S. Census)
These weren’t statistical abstractions. They represented schools closing, businesses shuttering, churches emptying and Main Streets dying. Graduating seniors in Eastern Kentucky schools had the choice of either college or migrating to Cincinnati or Detroit, seeking factory wages their home counties could not provide.
The routes they traveled — U.S. 23 from Pikeville north through Ashland into Ohio; U.S. 25 from southeastern Kentucky into Ohio’s industrial corridor — became known as the Hillbilly Highway. By the 1970s, Cincinnati’s Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, Akron’s North Hill, Detroit’s southern suburbs and Chicago’s Uptown housed substantial Appalachian enclaves.
The Urban Appalachian Council, founded in Cincinnati in 1974, documented the challenges these migrants faced: discrimination, culture shock, housing insecurity and persistent poverty despite steady factory work. But they kept coming because the coal economy at home was mechanizing rapidly, eliminating thousands of jobs even as production remained stable.
Return migration: 1980s reversal
Starting in the late 1980s, the flow began to slow and partially reverse. As Rust Belt factories shuttered — victims of automation, foreign competition and the North American Free Trade Agreement — laid-off workers trickled back to Kentucky.
The reversal: In the 1950s-60s, two-thirds of Eastern Kentuckians who moved left the state. Today, three-quarters stay within Kentucky.
The Urban Appalachian Council tracked this “return migration” through the 1990s. But returnees came back to retire or live on disability, not to work. Eastern Kentucky’s coal economy had continued to decline, leaving few employment opportunities for prime-age workers.
This return flow represented adjustment, not revival. The net outmigration slowed, but counties continued to lose population overall. What’s different about the 2020s pattern is that families are choosing to stay within the region even when economic conditions remain difficult.
Migration as adaptation
Today’s Eastern Kentucky migration reflects neither the desperate escape of the 1950s nor the hopeful return of the 1990s. Instead, it reveals pragmatic adaptation: families seeking health care, housing or marginally better job prospects while maintaining ties to home.
This pattern appears in the granular data. When Harlan County residents move, they most often relocate to neighboring Bell County or to Lexington. When Floyd County residents move, they head to Pike County or Fayette County. When Perry County residents leave, they resettle in nearby counties or Lexington.
Percentage of outmigrants moving to other Kentucky counties (2021-22). In 9 of 10 counties studied, most migrants now relocate within Kentucky rather than out of state.
The moves are incremental, one county over, perhaps two. They maintain the possibility of weekend visits, Sunday dinners and participation in family life. They preserve cultural connection even as they seek economic improvement.
Whether this represents resilience or resignation depends on perspective. Optimists see families finding creative ways to stay rooted despite persistent poverty. Pessimists note that regional opportunities remain limited, forcing even short-distance moves as acts of survival rather than choice.
What it means
The shift from exodus to circulation has reshaped Eastern Kentucky in ways both subtle and profound:

Regional hubs matter more. Counties with hospitals, colleges, and interstate access now function as population anchors, drawing residents from surrounding counties while losing fewer to distant cities.
Family networks persist. Unlike the mid-century generation that often severed ties with Kentucky, today’s movers remain embedded in regional social networks, maintaining connections across county lines.
The diaspora isn’t growing. With less outmigration to Rust Belt cities, the Appalachian diaspora communities in Ohio, Michigan and Illinois are aging and shrinking. The next generation is staying home — or at least staying closer.
Kentucky captures more of its talent. Young people leaving Pike or Harlan counties now often stop in Lexington rather than continuing to Columbus or Nashville, keeping their economic contributions within state borders.
Return migration continues. Retirees from the diaspora continue trickling back, though at modest levels and with limited economic impact.

The unfinished story
The inward turn of Appalachian migration reflects both progress and persistent challenge. The hemorrhage has stopped, but the region hasn’t healed.
Most Eastern Kentucky counties continue to lose population, just more slowly and to closer destinations than before. Birth rates have plummeted as young women leave or delay childbearing. Natural decrease — more deaths than births — now compounds outmigration in counties like Harlan and Letcher.
But the shift toward intra-regional migration suggests something important: Eastern Kentuckians still value home. They move when necessary, but they move as little as necessary. They seek better opportunities, but they define “better” to include proximity to family, familiarity with place and maintenance of cultural connection.
The great midcentury exodus told a story of abandonment, of mountain people forced to become city people in search of survival. Today’s quieter pattern tells a different story — one of adaptation, persistence and stubborn attachment to place.
The Hillbilly Highway has become a country road in Kentucky, winding through the mountains rather than leaving them behind. 



About the data 
The IRS migration dataset tracks household address changes between tax filings, providing the most comprehensive county-to-county migration data available. “Returns” approximate households; “exemptions” approximate individuals. Data reflect moves between filing 2020 returns (calendar year 2021) and 2021 returns (calendar year 2022).
Historical population figures for 1950-1980 come from decennial census counts. Net migration estimates account for natural increase (births minus deaths) to isolate migration effects.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Feeling anxious about how to pay for your winter heating bill? You’re not alone, according to the latest Ocean State Poll from the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which found roughly 78% of Rhode Islanders feel the same way about their upcoming winter heating bills. 
Unease over heating prices has risen since last November, when UNH researchers found 70% of residents were worried about their winter energy bills. Among the anxious, 40% said they were “very worried,” while 37% were “worried.” 
And that worry was expressed across each of the three voter affiliations used in the survey released Nov. 25 — Democrat, Republican and independent — expressed being “worried” or “very worried.” That included 88% of independents, 83% of Democrats, and 61% of Republicans.
Independents, or unaffiliated voters, comprised the overall survey’s largest share at about 51% of the total of 711 residents surveyed. The survey was conducted online between Nov. 13 and 17.
The worries are not abstract, as evidenced by Federal Energy Information Administration data which shows Rhode Island home heating oil prices at about $3.88 a gallon in the last week of November 2025. That’s up from the same time last year, when a gallon of oil cost about $3.52. It’s also significantly above pandemic-era November 2020, when heating oil cost about $2.31 a gallon in Rhode Island. 
Heating oil is, however, still below the heights achieved in the fall of 2022, when October and November oil prices regularly soared above $5 a gallon, almost reaching $5.89 in the last week of October 2022.
Propane has been similarly expensive in recent years, with federal data showing residential propane averages about $3.56 a gallon on Nov. 24, 2025, comparable to the $3.61 per gallon recorded in the same time period in November 2024, but still above the high-$2.80s of late 2020. Like oil, propane prices spiked in fall 2022, regularly reaching the $3.80s in October and November of that year. 
The day after the poll was released, Rhode Island Energy submitted a request to increase service charges for gas and electric customers in an application submitted to the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission. If approved, the proposed new distribution rates which would take effect in September 2026 would increase the average residential electric bill by about $7.78 a month, while a typical gas customer would pay $343.53 more annually, a 20.6% jump.
Gloomy on the economy
Rhode Islanders’ concerns about heating bills are embedded in a larger pessimism about the economy at large, with only 13% of the 711 respondents surveyed saying their household is financially better off than it was a year ago.  
“Rhode Islanders are generally downbeat on the state and national economies, as a majority feel that the economy is getting worse,” the survey’s introduction states.
Another 40% of respondents said their household was financially worse off than a year ago, while 47% did not discern any substantial change in their household finances over the previous 12 months. Half of respondents who identified as Democrats felt their households were worse off, while only 24% of Republicans did.  
“The fact that they were so close together, was surprising to me,” Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, said after she looked over the poll results. ”Normally I would say, ‘Oh, it’s a partisan thing,’ but clearly this is something that is impacting all people.”
Tanzi, known as a strong advocate for energy affordability, noted that in Washington County, which includes the district she represents, just under half of people were “very worried” about energy costs, higher than any other county in the state.
“I certainly hear it from my neighbors,” Tanzi said. 
The poll found about 40% of households making under $75,000 a year and 54% of households making under $45,000 annually said they were worse off financially than last year. 
The sample’s largest of six income demographics — households making over $150,000 annually, which accounted for 135 respondents — said they had stayed the same since last year at 56%, although equal amounts of 22% thought they were better or worse off from last year. 
The survey does show that broader pessimism about the macroeconomic picture has shrunk somewhat in the past six months, slightly more so when looking toward the future. When the survey center asked the same questions of Rhode Islanders back in May, 45% of respondents expected to be financially worse off a year from now. In the new survey, that number has fallen to 35%, and an additional 21% of respondents think they will be better off in a year. The other 45% expect to be in roughly the same place financially.
Affordability concerns are more than a seasonal trend, said Camilo Viveiros, executive director of the George Wiley Center in Pawtucket, a nonprofit which advocates for low-income Rhode Islanders.
Viveiros pointed to percentage of income payment plans (PIPP), which would cap bills according to a fixed percentage of a customer’s income. A bill to institute PIPP in Rhode Island was submitted by Democratic Rep. Scott Slater of Providence early in the 2025 legislative session, but it failed to move out of committee. 
“The George Wiley Center urges public officials to listen to our calls to restructure rates for long term affordability,” Viveiros said in an email Friday, adding that “it is time” for state officials “who profess to care about affordability to lend their support for the PIPP proposal.” 
He also pointed to a policy brief recently published Nov. 20 by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, which pointed to PIPP as a means to “restructure rates for long term affordability.”
The brief noted that a broader Federal Poverty Line benchmark would apply to PIPP eligibility and could be optimized if paired with the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, which is a federal program.
In fiscal year 2025, Rhode Island received nearly $27 million in LIHEAP funding, which helps low-income families with a one-time seasonal payment they can put toward heating bills. The minimum benefit was $64 and the maximum was $1,148, with higher allowances up to $1,500 during a winter crisis. 
In fiscal year 2024, 28,234 Rhode Island households got help from the LIHEAP program. 
Tanzi said she’s worried about the program in 2026 due to changes in federal policy. A shutdown-induced delay concluded Friday when $3.6 billion in LIHEAP funding nationally was finally released to states. If LIHEAP suffers any cuts, Tanzi said, “we’re really in a crisis for people.” She pointed to lower-income survey respondents who answered the question, “Do you worry about winter energy costs?” 
Such respondents might be “basing their assumptions and their response to this on the availability of LIHEAP money,” Tanzi said. “If we did this poll again in two months, or three months, I have a feeling that things would be incredibly different in the responses.”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)After months of hearings and study, the legislature’s Joint Commission on the Future of Cannabis Sales is poised to roll out a final proposal Tuesday that would launch a legal, regulated adult-use cannabis retail market in Virginia — potentially ending five years of economic and legal uncertainty since the commonwealth legalized possession and cultivation in 2021. 
The latest version — sponsored by Commission Chair Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, in the House of Delegates and Sens. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, and Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, in the Senate — scraps the controversial local-opt-out clause, increases local taxing authority and builds a licensing regime designed to privilege small, independent, Virginia-based businesses over large medical-marijuana operators.
Krizek said the refinements are not about maximizing short-term revenue, but creating a sustainable, decentralized market that channels tax dollars back into communities disproportionately harmed by the War on Drugs — even if that means giving up some early windfalls.
“The goal has been to make sure it is a decentralized market structure, competitive, sustainable, prioritizing independent Virginia-based businesses,” Krizek told The Mercury in an interview last week. 
 Retail plan moves forward after years of vetoes

Virginia became the first Southern state to legalize adult-use cannabis in 2021, allowing adults 21 and older to possess up to 1 ounce and cultivate up to four plants at home. But the law included no mechanism for legal sales, and successive retail-market bills were blocked by vetoes from outgoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
The commission created earlier this year aims to deliver what lawmakers couldn’t: a comprehensive retail structure. Its final proposal is set to be formally introduced ahead of the 2026 session, with sales targeted to begin Nov. 1, 2026 — provided lawmakers clear the bill and Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger signs it.
Supporters say the absence of a legal retail framework has only bolstered the illicit market. “It was a bad day for organized crime in the illicit cannabis market,” Krizek said earlier this month, referring to the election of Spanberger, who has pledged to sign adult-use legislation.
Spanberger, a Democrat, told The Mercury in August that she supports “a legalized retail market for cannabis.” 
 What’s new: Opt-outs gone; local control expanded

The biggest change to the retail framework: a provision that would have allowed localities to opt out of cannabis sales altogether has been eliminated. 
Under earlier drafts, counties and cities could have banned retail outlets via referendum — a feature critics likened to “dry counties,” which risked stranding large populations without access to legal cannabis.
“We’re not going to have an opt-out for a lot of reasons,” Krizek said. 
He argued that opt-outs would invite unregulated illicit markets to flourish in “dry” zones, threaten public safety and undermine statewide equity and revenue goals. He added that local governments would retain full control over zoning, buffer zones and licensing requirements under the new plan.
The final bill also increases local taxing authority. Under previous proposals, localities could levy up to 2.5% in local excise tax. The new draft raises that cap to 3.5%, giving local governments more resources for schools, public-health campaigns and other priorities. 
The state tax remains at a proposed 8% — with a new provision to allow deductibility of certain business costs at the state level, even though marijuana remains federally illegal. 
The bill would also remove the sales tax on paraphernalia and treat those items under ordinary sales tax rules.
“With the local tax bump, communities will have a little bit more resources to do the things they need to do at the local level,” Krizek said.
Perhaps most consequential is a licensing regime aimed at decentralizing ownership and expanding opportunity for “micro-business” operators.

As many as 50% of initial licenses would be reserved for micro-businesses — small operators who grow, process or sell cannabis on a modest scale. Large medical-marijuana operators will still be eligible, but all license holders will be capped at five total retail and/or grow/processing authorizations. 
Krizek said even a silent partner with a small stake — say 1% — would count toward that limit, making corporate consolidation difficult.
A new direct-to-consumer license also would allow micro-businesses to deliver cannabis directly to patient or adult-use customers’ homes — subject to regulation by the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority (CCA).
Krizek said the overall goal is to build “hundreds of new, small local businesses,” strengthen Virginia’s agricultural sector and direct tax dollars to the communities harmed most by prohibition. 
“We all recognize that we need to regulate, control and tax marijuana, so that we have a revenue that can help the community reinvest… and the racially disparate impacts of the prohibition or the War on Drugs.”
He emphasized the aim is a “well regulated adult market” that remains competitive and sustainable, even if the state takes in less tax revenue early on, rather than let a handful of large companies corner the industry.
 Commission draws on recent data and industry hearings

The final proposal, which will be posted to Virginia’s legislative information system in the coming days, reflects insights gathered at a series of public hearings held by the commission this year. 
In August, lawmakers heard from experts on taxation, equity and small-business opportunity — clear signals that the commission was preparing to write a framework that diverged from past drafts.
Players in the medical-cannabis system — which underlies the retail rollout — recently logged major milestones. The CCA’s seed-to-sale tracking system, operated through the vendor Metrc, is now live. Between July and August, the medical market recorded nearly $30 million in sales across more than 256,000 transactions. 
Proponents say that tracking, combined with planned labeling rules, testing standards, and delivery-license oversight, marks one of the strongest regulatory regimes in the country — and a much firmer barrier between the legal and illicit markets than existed under previous, vetoed plans. 
Critics at past hearings pointed out that older drafts still lacked crucial definitions for delivery agents and clarity on labeling, especially for edibles and topicals.
 Labor advocates welcome promise of “people-based market”

UFCW 400 — a union representing 35,000 workers across retail, cannabis, grocery, health care, food-processing and service jobs in the mid-Atlantic — praised the new plan’s emphasis on small businesses and equitable labor practices.
“We at UFCW 400 are excited to finally see a pathway for an adult use marketplace here in Virginia. We are pushing for a people-based market, one that centers workers, consumers, and community,” Kayla Mock, the union’s vice president, said in an email. 
The union hopes the legislation will include labor-peace provisions to ensure any worker organizing efforts are free from retaliation. Mock added that monopolies in the cannabis sector are bad for workers, consumers and long-term fairness, and supported the micro-license approach as a check against corporate dominance.
Union leaders say that, in states lacking labor protections, cannabis workers have faced “retaliation, intimidation and termination” when they attempted to unionize — conditions they hope Virginia’s new law will avoid.
 What’s next — and what could derail the rollout

The commission is scheduled to formally present the finalized proposal at Tuesday’s meeting, clearing the way for lawmakers to introduce the bill in the 2026 session. If all goes well — and there are no new roadblocks — retail sales could potentially begin Nov. 1, 2026.
But the outcome is not yet certain. Opponents may raise familiar concerns about public health, youth access and law enforcement challenges. Some have noted that the transition from decriminalization to a fully regulated retail market carries risks — especially if regulators do not balance access, safety and equity correctly.
Still, advocates say the revamped legislation could deliver on long-promised reforms. “We’ve got to stand up this legal marketplace sooner rather than later,” Krizek said.
If the bill passes next year, Virginia could finally close the book on five years of legal limbo — and become a test case for a Southern state embracing adult-use cannabis with an eye toward equity, community reinvestment and small-business growth.

(Photo by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)The Shenandoah salamander, northern long-eared bat and the rusty patch bumble bee are among the many animals on the federal endangered species list that live in Virginia and could be impacted by  proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act by the Trump administration.
Last week, the Department of Interior announced plans to roll back portions of the protections for plants and animals. The proposal calls for economic factors to be taken into account when determining adding species and habitats to the protective lists; previously it was a decision based solely on science.
In Virginia there are over 50 federally protected fauna species, and dozens more that are state protected.
“These proposals … will have the effect of likely meaning fewer species are listed, fewer species are getting the protections they need in their listing rules, and fewer critical habitat areas will be designated,” said Ramona McGee, the wildlife program leader for the Southern Environmental Law Center, which has two offices in Virginia, in Charlottesville and Richmond. “That all undermines the goal and purposes of the Endangered Species Act to conserve and recover threatened endangered species.”
Currently, species that are federally listed as “threatened” get the same protections as the species that have officially been deemed “endangered.” This means they cannot be killed or harmed unless species-specific alternatives are approved by the federal government. The proposal would remove those protections for threatened species.
“This administration is restoring the Endangered Species Act to its original intent, protecting species through clear, consistent and lawful standards that also respect the livelihoods of Americans who depend on our land and resources,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “These revisions end years of legal confusion and regulatory overreach, delivering certainty to states, tribes, landowners and businesses while ensuring conservation efforts remain grounded in sound science and common sense.”
Additionally, the proposal looks to narrow what can be considered critical habitat and would make it easier for development projects such as drilling, mining and logging to be approved.
“Someone who is wanting to build a data center or to build a pipeline will not have to consider as wide a range of impacts or effects from that action as they might otherwise have to under the existing regulations,” McGee said. 
The proposed rule changes “would significantly narrow the scope of the effects that could be considered during that consultation process, and by extension, that means it will constrain the sort of conservation measures that could be put in place,” McGee added.
Environmental groups and endangered species advocates say rolling back these rules will lead to more extinctions and make it harder to bring some species back from the brink.
“These regulations attempt to undermine implementation of one of America’s bedrock environmental laws, and they could seal the fate of animals that, without these protections, would disappear from the Earth,” said Sierra Club Executive Director Loren Blackford in a statement.
An open public comment period is underway for the proposed change, allowing people to share their opinions on the proposal. After the public comment period ends on Dec. 21, it will be up to the agency to finalize the rule.

None shines brighter than its system of public colleges and universities.
Why, then, have the executive branches of the state and federal government gone after these prestigious institutions of higher learning in an ideological purge with all the grace and discernment of thugs in a dark alleyway?
I get it:  Conservatives have long chafed at the perceptions elite universities and their faculty lean left and that it influences their alumni who ascend to powerful roles in government, finance, law and media. To conservatives’ credit, they’re not always wrong.
We’ve seen thinkers and influencers on the right hounded, threatened and worse by students on the left. Scheduled appearances have been canceled altogether and conservative voices shouted down on college campuses — the last place where free, peaceful expression, thought and inquiry should be stifled.
Two years ago, an online petition by George Mason University students sought to disinvite Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, from addressing the spring 2023 commencement at the invitation of the university’s president, Gregory Washington.
GMU’s president is right to reject students’ call to cancel Youngkin’s commencement speech

Washington stood his ground and welcomed the conservative governor to campus. Three years before that, during nationwide protests over the curbside police murder of George Floyd, Washington — who is Black — thwarted attempts to destroy a statue to GMU’s white, slaveholding namesake at the state’s largest and most diverse state-supported university.
Yet it is Washington, because of his work to diversify GMU’s faculty and student body, who is the target of a committed effort by the Trump White House (you’d imagine it has more pressing business) to oust him unless he publicly apologizes for his diversity work. Again, Washington is standing his ground.
It heightens the irony that Washington is among three Virginia college presidents targeted for ouster by conservatives over what they decry as “woke” diversity, equity and inclusion programs. 
They began after Youngkin’s conservative appointees took charge of the governing boards of those universities: GMU, the University of Virginia and Virginia Military Institute. They became amplified, with an urgent stridency, after Donald Trump took office in January and tasked his departments of Education and Justice to root out DEI at universities nationwide with a focus on Ivy League schools.
At VMI, that school’s first African American superintendent (analogous to a president elsewhere) was forced out in late February when a Youngkin-appointed majority on VMI’s board voted not to renew his contract beyond its June expiration. Retired Army Maj. Gen. Cedric Wins, a VMI alumnus, was appointed superintendent in late 2020 under Democratic former Gov. Ralph Northam to advance DEI at VMI after an independent report uncovered widespread sexism and racism, including “racial slurs and jokes” on campus.
While the board stated no reason for its vote, House of Delegates Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, called it “purely political.” A spokesman for Youngkin said board members did “what they believe to be in the best interest of this prestigious military college” but offered no reason for the action.
The second head to roll came in June when UVA’s president, Jim Ryan, resigned with the state’s flagship university facing threats of punitive litigation by the Trump Justice Department and tens of millions of dollars in fines plus millions more in lost federal research grants over the university’s DEI standards in hiring and admissions.
The DoJ, under its novel interpretation of the 60-year-old Civil Rights Act that was passed to end discrimination against Black people in the Jim Crow South, alleged UVA had violated the statute by disadvantaging white applicants. That was the hammer that forced Ryan out in early summer, but the pressure had begun in March after Youngkin’s administration began urging the university to dismantle its DEI program. 
A tone-deaf attack on diversity at a university first built by the enslaved

The Justice Department paused its investigation after Ryan’s resignation and reached a settlement with UVA in October. Then came this month’s thundering Blue Wave election that portends to change everything. Republicans were swept out of every statewide executive office as Democrats won almost two-thirds of the 100-seat House of Delegates.
Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger fired the first salvo in a remarkable flurry of jaw-dropping letters related to Virginia’s university boards. She penned a Nov. 12 open letter to the Youngkin-dominated UVA Board of Visitors urging it to suspend an ongoing search for Ryan’s successor. The unspoken subtext is that effective at noon on Jan. 17, she can sack the whole board by happy hour and put her own slate of members before a Democratic House and Senate for fast confirmation.
On Nov. 13, Youngkin responded with his own missive, rebuking Spanberger — a UVA alumna — for “efforts to bully or micromanage” the university board, urging the current presidential search process to continue apace and reminding his successor that he runs the state until inauguration day. Youngkin also insisted that “it’s clear that neither (the) DoJ nor the current Board leadership made Jim (Ryan) resign.”
On the 14th, Ryan issued his own 12-page epistle disputing Youngkin’s defense of the Justice Department and the Board. In it, Ryan disclosed Justice Department lawyers’ alleged threats “bleed UVA white” and “basically rain hell on UVA” unless Ryan complied with their resignation demand just hours ahead of their 5 p.m. deadline on June 26. He met the deadline and, for 141 days, heeded the warning to remain mute.  
Ryan wrote that some wondered why he didn’t just go public about the DoJ pressure campaign, and he said he considered it. 
“But the call for my resignation, right until the end, seemed so outlandish as not to be entirely believable. It also felt like a hostage situation, where the kidnapper threatens harm if you do not keep information about the demands confidential,” the former UVA leader wrote.
Washington is still GMU’s president. His cause — and, by extension, Spanberger’s — seemed boosted recently when the Virginia Supreme Court refused to hear the Youngkin administration’s appeal of a lower court ruling that Youngkin appointees to the GMU, UVA and VMI boards could not serve because they lacked Senate confirmation.
So here we sit, in a state long hailed for the quality of its colleges and universities, consumed in enough contrived drama to keep reality-TV addicts glued to Bravo for months on end.
According to a new report by the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee, Virginia’s 15 public universities are part of a system ranked first nationally in 2025 by CNBC. Three Virginia universities are among the top 100 nationally in the most recent annual U.S. News & World Report rankings, including UVA as America’s No. 4 public university.
Trump’s ‘excellence’ compact kills UVA’s free speech and self-rule

This was an unnecessary fight, brought on by unprecedented Executive Branch overreach from both the White House and Youngkin. It weakens our public institutions of higher learning and feeds growing cynicism that they are pawns of boards doing the partisan bidding of whomever is in power, without regard for the unique needs and missions of each.
The tragedy is that the seeming remedy — wholesale replacements and reversals pending from a new governor and party in charge in Richmond that appears eager to battle Trump in court — will appear to many to be just as nakedly political.
Thus the pendulum swings, wider and faster.  
Like so much spoiled by today’s necrotic politics, there’s no clear path from the present chaos and enmity back to norms of sanity, civility and reason in the governance of these exemplary institutions. We’re all the poorer for it.

State senators may call UVA leaders to the carpet over agreement to end DOJ investigations

In April, the U.S. Department of Justice launched an investigation into UVA over claims that the institution violated federal civil rights laws in its admissions, hiring, diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and that its campus culture was inhospitable to Jewish students. UVA refuted the allegations, but signed an agreement with the DoJ last month to put the inquiries on ice.
UVA, Department of Justice agree to pause civil rights investigations

UVA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday’s meeting with lawmakers. 
Interim President Paul Mahoney is scheduled to attend the gathering, according to the agenda, along with Rachel Sheridan and Porter Wilkinson, the rector and vice rector for the UVA Board of Visitors, to provide an update on institutional leadership and finances. 
Del. Katrina Callsen, D-Albemarle, who does not sit on the Senate Finance & Appropriations subcommittee for higher education, has been critical of UVA’s decisions and its agreement with the DoJ. She, along with Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, called for leaders to reverse the action.
“I want transparency for both the public and the legislature,” Callsen said in a statement to the Mercury last week. “I trust that my Senate colleagues will pursue information that will help everyone better understand the interactions that occurred between UVA and the federal government and the full nature of the settlement agreement UVA formed with the DOJ. Virginians deserve to know what is happening in Virginia universities.”
Lawmakers have expressed disappointment over the matter and urged the institution to reconsider its decision, but have never imposed any consequences. They only reminded UVA officials of its responsibilities concerning legal liability, state sovereignty and conflict with existing law. They have also said state funding to the school could be impacted.
However, UVA leaders have stood by the decision to sign the agreement, unlike other institutions that have gone to court, risking losing federal funds. Gov. Glenn Youngkin called the agreement a “fair deal” in support.
Senators will also hear from Virginia Military Institute Superintendent Lt. General David Furness — who replaced former Ret. Major Gen. Cedric Wins, the first Black superintendent who was ousted by the governing board — and updates from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia and the Council of Presidents.
The meeting is scheduled for 10 a.m.

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)Many Maine households and businesses have felt squeezed by electricity costs in recent years. With prices set to increase even more, lawmakers are trying to do what they can to lower consumers’ bills.
Lawmakers passed a law last legislative session that is meant to lower the cost of net energy billing, a renewable energy credit program that receives a lot of blame for rising costs, though officials point to the volatility of fossil fuels as the real driver of the increases. 
But the work to lower Mainers’ energy expenses isn’t over yet and lawmakers are contemplating ways that tax credits could help with that.
Just last week, the Public Utilities Commission announced new electricity prices for 2026. Both Central Maine Power and Versant customers can expect to see their bills increase by an average of $13 to $17, according to an analysis by the Office of Public Advocate. 
But even before that increase was announced, legislative leaders decided to consider at least two bills when lawmakers reconvene in January that propose using tax credits to offset energy costs. 
One proposal was initially introduced last session but didn’t have a public hearing before the Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee until the end of October. Bill sponsor Rep. Steven Foster (R-Dexter) said LD 1223 would shift the cost of assistance programs from ratepayer to taxpayers.
The bill proposes a refundable income tax credit for ratepayers of 6% of the total amount paid for electricity services in the previous calendar year. That amount would represent how much each household is paying for various assistance programs, including net energy billing, the low-income assistance program, and the arrearage management program, which helps low-income customers who are behind on their bills. 
For example, if a household paid $120 towards those programs over the course of the year, they would file for an income tax credit for that amount, which would then be paid from the state’s general fund. 
The thinking is that more people, including tourists and part-time residents, pay into the general fund and their contribution would help allay the burden currently placed solely on energy customers.
Foster also argued that having ratepayers shoulder the cost of these social programs operates like a regressive tax, in which low income consumers pay a greater proportion of their income, whereas shifting those costs to the general fund utilizes Maine’s existing progressive tax structure. 
During the hearing for LD 1223, there was mention of a similar bill from Rep. Kilton Webb (D-Durham) that will go before the Taxation Committee next year. Webb’s bill is still being drafted, but he said it will propose a $50 a month tax credit for qualifying low-income ratepayers. 
“This comes from the most important word of our times which is ‘affordability,’” Webb said. 
As a member of the energy committee, Webb said he wanted to find innovative ways to alleviate costs for ratepayers. 
“If a freshman Democrat legislator and a ranking member on the Republican side are kinda coming to the same conclusion, I think this is an idea with some real legs,” Webb said, referring to his and Foster’s bills. 
Foster’s bill is more nuanced, which Webb said speaks to the more senior lawmaker’s creativity and experience. However, both lawmakers said they are open to bipartisan work on these proposals to help turn them into policy that could benefit ratepayers.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CMPbill-2048x1536-3-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 05:56:42.597460

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Thanksgiving holiday is known to include tables full of food, but with Ohioans still feeling the effects of federal cuts to SNAP and food banks still bending under the weight of demand, for some the table won’t be quite as full.
The federal government’s shutdown and the hold-up it caused for existing SNAP benefits didn’t help matters. The Ohio Association of Foodbanks served 46% more people at state food pantries from Nov. 1 to Nov. 21 than it had on average in each of the previous months this year.
“This situation underscored the critical importance of SNAP as the first line of defense against hunger for many families, seniors, and disabled Ohioans that would regularly face food budget shortfalls without support from SNAP,” Joree Novotny, executive director of the association, told the Capital Journal.
Even prior to the shutdown, the association was already seeing increases in the first quarter of this year, and had concerns about how they would sustain the help amid growing demand.
“While the impact of the shutdown shined a light on the issue, food insecurity was far too prevalent before the shutdown and remains far too prevalent in its aftermath,” Novotny said.
From July to September of this year, the network saw a 6.7% increase in food provided compared to the same period in 2024, a 14% increase from 2023, and a nearly 41% increase from 2022. This included take-home groceries, hot meals and meals provided at community sites.
Food banks had to accommodate reductions in federal contributions from the USDA, which Novotny said they did by sourcing more than 28 million pounds of donated food, and spending monetary donations on 16.2 million pounds on food. That sourcing made up 70% of all the food provided through the network.
“Normally, federal and state (contributions) represent about half of all of the food our network distributes,” Novotny said. “This level of private purchasing cannot be sustained, particularly by food banks serving areas of the state facing philanthropy gaps and wider disparity in resources.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXFood pantries weren’t the only ones attempting to make up for the SNAP shortfalls. The Children’s Hunger Alliance worked to battle child hunger impacts from the SNAP situation, despite seeing drops in state funding. The alliance’s state contribution went from the governor’s proposal that would have provided $3.75 million in each of the next two years, down to $3 million in fiscal year 2026 and $2.5 million in 2027 as approved in the final budget.
While the alliance was able to “hold the line” with regard to federal and state support in combination with private donations, changes in childhood food insecurity take a year or more to understand, according to the organization’s president, Michelle M. Brown.
“The SNAP disruption during the government shutdown may continue to affect low-income families in the weeks and months ahead, because many were forced to make difficult budget choices in November,” Brown said.
The leader said there are still “looming threats to federal food programs” that could send families right back into the dilemma of making hard decisions between paying bills and putting food on the table.
In 2024, the Children’s Hunger Alliance served 10.8 million meals to more than 161,000 children in 76 Ohio counties, according to alliance data.
More than 517,000 children experienced food insecurity in Ohio in 2023, according to the most recent data from Feeding America. Of those, 72% met the income eligibility for federal food assistance programs like SNAP.
“Childhood hunger is a solvable issue – it just requires public and private leadership, financial resources, and communities united behind the belief that every child deserves the chance to thrive and reach their full potential,” Brown said.
The alliance built a partnership with public and private donors to launch the “Thanksgiving Meals initiative,” providing food and a gift cards to 1,900 households in central Ohio this year. The organization also extended their Weekend Meals program during the Thanksgiving and Christmas weeks “to ensure children across Ohio have access to nutritious meals when school’s out.”

(Promotional photo courtesy of Chipotle)The ads are everywhere: “Pay at your own pace.” “Split it into four interest-free installments.” “Shop now.” 
For millions of shoppers, buy-now-pay-later options like Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm have become the preferred way to pay. These companies promise to make the shopping experience easier by letting you split your payments, avoid interest, and keep track of your purchases all in one place. Today you can use them to pay for everything from flights to shoes to Chipotle burritos. 
Sounds empowering, right?
Except it’s not. Behind their friendly designed platforms is a system that targets consumers, hurts credit scores, and encourages impulsive spending. 
There is no question that buy-now-pay-later services make shopping feel easier. You can buy what you want right away, even if you don’t have the cash up front. You can shop online or in-store and quickly check out with your item without needing a credit card. And if you’re unsure about an item, you can order it, try it at home, and return it if it does not fit right, all without actually having to pay. Buy-now-pay-later companies make owing debt to shop sound convenient and harmless — and that is exactly what makes them so risky. Creating an account with them basically only requires an address, a phone number, proof that you’re over 18 and a payment method. 
In reality, these companies mislead the very people they attract. Their “pay over time” plan lets shoppers split a purchase into smaller monthly payments. It sounds great, but the APR (the extra cost you pay for borrowing) can range from 0% to 36% depending on consumers’ credit score. A 2024 study from the Federal Reserve showed that buy-now-pay-later users tend to already have low credit scores, meaning that they are least likely to qualify for 0% payment plans. What looks like an easier way to pay ends up being more costly for target shoppers. 










 Behind their friendly designed platforms is a system that targets consumers, hurts credit scores, and encourages impulsive spending. 


Their other paying options are not as harmless as they seem. Their “Pay in 4 monthly installments” option might be interest-free, but they can collect late fees. As a user, frequent purchases made through these apps are easy to lose track of. In a 2025 survey from LendingTree, 41% of buy-now-pay-later users reported that they missed at least one payment in the past year. Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm all report missed or late payments to credit agencies. In the United States, where big purchases like homes and cars rely on a credit score, missing payments can negatively affect your creditworthiness — and your future plans. 
We should be more worried about the psychology behind these apps. On its website, Klarna proudly states that businesses using their service specifically see a 40% increase in order value and a 46% higher purchase frequency than the average consumer. In other words, Klarna openly admits that their success depends on getting people to spend more through its well-developed checkout process. The overspending that these companies promote does not only harm our wallets, it also harms our planet. Klarna’s partner network consists of 790,000 brands, Afterpay’s has 348,000 and Affirm’s has 375,000. These include fast fashion retailers like River Island, Boohoo, Asos, Missguided and Pretty Little Thing, who all produce cheap clothing that end up in landfills. For context, the fast fashion industry makes up 10% of global emissions. With the help of these apps, that rate can increase.
In September this year, Klarna raised approximately $1.37 billion through its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, which made it one of the largest IPOs of 2025. The Swedish company recently reported $903 million in third quarter revenue, over three times the number from two years ago. This growth comes at the expense of consumers. Millions of people use buy-now-pay-later services without fully understanding their risks. What looks like convenience can leave your friends, family or even you into debt, with lower creditworthiness and future financial stress. These companies profit from consumers’ lack of understanding — that needs to change. 
The government must enforce clearer cost disclosures, greater transparency about interest rates and stricter sign-up policies that include credit education. As consumers, we must also do our part by thinking twice next time we shop now and pay later.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)Northeast of the capital city of Des Moines in central Iowa, the 400-student Collins-Maxwell Community School District is one of many across the state shifting to a four-day school week.
Like many rural K-12 schools, the district has struggled to find teachers, and it sees the four-day week as a useful recruiting tool. It also wants to curb student absences, which tend to spike on Mondays and Fridays.
The district maintained its traditional five-day calendar in August and September. But from now on, with scattered exceptions, the middle school and high school in the Collins-Maxwell district will be closed on Mondays. To meet Iowa’s minimum number of instructional hours, the district will lengthen the other days during four-day weeks.
Superintendent Marc Snavely said he watched nearby schools transition to shorter weeks and was intrigued by the reports he got from his counterparts in other districts. Snavely hopes the shorter week will boost teacher morale, reduce burnout, and make the rural district more competitive with nearby districts that are larger and can offer teachers better pay.
“Ultimately, the ‘why’ behind the four-day school week came down to staff recruitment and retention,” Snavely said in an interview. “We felt being a small school district, the four-day week would allow us to better compete.”
He added that surrounding schools with four-day weeks said they experienced fewer discipline problems and improved attendance. And rural school districts across the country tout the four-day work week as a way to stretch tight school budgets amid K-12 funding uncertainties at the federal and state levels.
But despite the reports of higher attendance and calmer classrooms, education researchers say the evidence tells a more complicated story.










Ultimately, the ‘why’ behind the four-day school week came down to staff recruitment and retention.


– Collins-Maxwell Community School District Superintendent Marc Snavely


Emily Morton, lead researcher for the Northwest Evaluation Association, which creates standardized testing for K-12 schools, cautioned that the promised benefits have not shown up in the data. Moreover, longer school days can harm academic performance, Morton said.
But such concerns might not matter as four-day school weeks become more popular nationwide.
“One thing that does show up clearly is that there is an extremely high approval rating for these policies,” Morton said. “Parents and students overwhelmingly want to stay on a four-day week once they have it.”
A rural trend
There are more than 2,100 schools in 26 states using four-day weeks, according to researchers at Oregon State University. In Iowa, the number of districts on a four-day schedule has grown from six in 2023-24 to more than two dozen in 2025. In Colorado, two-thirds of districts are on the altered schedule.
But so far, it’s almost entirely a rural phenomenon.
“To my knowledge, there’s not a single urban district using a four-day week,” Morton said. “What a four-day week looks like in a rural community is very different from what people in suburban or urban areas imagine.”
4-day school weeks, gaining in popularity, face pushback from lawmakers

Dr. Shanon Taylor, an education professor at the University of Nevada, Reno who studies school scheduling, said districts typically adopt the model for economic and staffing reasons, not academic ones. Rural districts often save money on transportation, utilities and building operations, she said, and the promise of permanent three-day weekends helps recruitment efforts.
However, the burden of accommodating this transition may fall heavily on parents who work five days a week, and especially on the parents of younger students who must find a child care alternative on the selected day off.
“The research is still mixed,” Taylor said. “We don’t yet have decisive evidence showing academic benefits or drawbacks.”
In June, researchers at the University of Oregon published a review of 11 studies on four-day school weeks, which included data on academic achievement, attendance, discipline and criminal activity. The impact of a four-day week varied based on grade level on location, the Oregon researchers found, but overall “there was no evidence of large positive effects.”
They also noted that “maintaining activities that foster healthy youth development on the fifth day is important for minimizing other negative impacts.”
State vs. local clashes
In some states, the policy has sparked conflict between state and local officials.
“There’s a lot of tension between state leaders and rural districts over whether the four-day week is something the state should allow,” said Morton. “In Oklahoma, when the state tried to take it away, districts simply shifted to ‘virtual Fridays’ — and instruction mostly didn’t happen.”
Why More School Districts Are Holding Class Just Four Days a Week

The Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, a conservative think tank, found through a public records request that more than 100 Oklahoma districts had at least one school where students had at least two full weeks’ worth of “virtual days” in the 2022-23 school year. More than 60 districts had at least one school that went online for three weeks or more. During many of those days, there was minimal live instruction.
In response, Oklahoma this year enacted a law that restricts public schools’ ability to shift to virtual learning. The measure limits districts to two days of virtual instruction each school year, and only allows them under certain circumstances, such as a state of emergency declared by the governor.
Missouri enacted a law in 2024 requiring that certain big city, charter and county districts obtain voter approval before adopting or continuing a four-day week. The Independence School District, a 14,000-student suburban system on the edge of Kansas City that switched to the shorter week in 2023-24, has since sued the state, alleging the law unconstitutionally targets certain districts based on arbitrary criteria such as county size.
Last year, a New Mexico mandate for districts to adopt calendars with more school days was halted in court. And Arkansas legislators considered a bill that would allow for range of instructional times from 160 to 190 days, which would be contingent on a school’s rating. A large number of rural districts there have moved to four-day schedules.
Meanwhile, uncertainty over the costs and benefits of the approach are likely to persist.
Morton, the education assessment researcher, said that small rural districts might not be equipped to determine whether a four-day week produces benefits until further studies are conducted across the country.
“Even if your test scores stay flat, nearby districts might be rising, so your ‘flat’ could actually be a negative effect,” she said. “States need to equip districts with what national research shows, because local data will never be able to answer these questions alone.”

The proposal: to connect their water systems with the city of Manchester to allow more than 1 million gallons of water to flow to the towns per day. 
The project, which involved Atkinson, Derry, Hampstead, Plaistow Salem, and Windham, was designed to address an acute problem: the contamination of wells in those towns by methyl-tert-butyl ether, an ingredient of gasoline that had seeped into the groundwater due to leaky storage. A 2003 lawsuit brought by the state against 22 gasoline manufacturers had secured settlement funds that helped pay for the $20 million water infrastructure project.  
But some now point to that collaboration — the largest of its kind in the state — as a template to address a thorny problem. As lawmakers and state officials seek to encourage housing construction to address deep shortages, some are pointing to a less discussed problem: access to water and sewer capacity. 
In October, St. Anselm College unveiled an update to the New Hampshire Zoning Atlas — the interactive tool first launched in 2023 to compare towns’ zoning restrictions. The latest version of the tool depicts which areas of cities and towns have access to water lines, sewer lines, or both. 
And the researchers behind the atlas uncovered a revealing statistic: Just 12% of the state’s buildable land has access to either water or sewer services, and just 5.6% has access to both. 
That poses a major limitation for developers. “When we talk about density, we’re talking about how many units can you put on an acre,” said Preston Hunter, vice president of business development at PROCON, a Hooksett construction management firm, speaking at a presentation of the Atlas in October. “And there’s really two major determining factors there. One is zoning, and the other is the availability of sewer and water.” 
In the southern part of the state, water can be particularly fraught. “A big issue we see is access to water,” Deshaies said. “There’s just not always enough groundwater to sustain more dense or larger developments that are being proposed.” 
But each town has its own unique problems. 
Housing policy experts point to some solutions. Alternative septic technology such as aerobic treatment systems, which use bacteria to break down waste in places with poor soil conditions, could allow property owners to develop housing in hard-to-reach areas, noted Elissa Margolis, director of the St. Anselm Initiative for Housing Policy and Practice. And community septic systems could allow more creative approaches at scale, she added.
But the biggest barrier often lies with the capacity of the existing infrastructure in a city or town. And just having access to water and sewer does not fix all problems, said Margaret Brynes, executive director of the New Hampshire Municipal Association. 
“Even when you look at land that can be developed that is on public water and sewer, you have to keep in mind capacity,” Byrnes said in an interview. “It’s not unlimited just because you have a public system.” 
One significant problem for municipalities is the age of their infrastructure. Simply maintaining it can be costly, let alone upgrades, said Brodie Deshaies, a legislative advocate at the Municipal Association. Many cities and towns are facing the need to improve the flow rate of their existing facilities before additional capacity is realistic. 
“We have members that struggle to be able to afford the upkeep with the continued downward pressure that’s caused by inflation, increased cost of living, and property taxes that fund the majority of services and infrastructure in the state,” Deshaies said.
Deterioration may force some towns to replace their pipes. But if they want to meaningfully expand their services, they might need to widen the pipes, an even more expensive prospect, said Deshaies. 
Meanwhile, water access poses its own conundrum: Cities and towns that draw on bodies of water for their water source are limited in how much they can draw by the state Department of Environmental Services. They also face limits on where and how much wastewater they can expel. 
Any solution is likely to require residents of a town to approve a large municipal bond to pay for it via a supermajority vote, at a time when property taxes are already high. 
Researchers behind the St. Anselm atlas hope that it will provide developers, municipalities, state officials, and lawmakers with a clearer understanding of where housing is possible — and where more needs to be done.
“It can help us understand more globally what types of investments might be needed and might be supported, especially for communities that clearly want more housing, but they’re constrained by the lack of infrastructure,” said Heather Shank, director of the Division of Planning and Community Development at the state Department of Business and Economic Affairs. 
The update to the atlas comes as legislators have passed a number of laws to prevent municipalities from imposing restrictions on housing in the last year. Housing advocates have said the laws are meant to eliminate road blocks to necessary development amid the state’s housing shortage.
But if more is not done to help cities and towns expand their water and sewer capacity, the Municipal Association argues, local governments will be forced to make hard decisions. 
“What will end up happening, in some cases, is they will either place a moratorium on building to update their zoning … to try to address (that) overburdening of infrastructure, or they will have to stop hooking up people to water and sewer,” Deshaies said. 
Lawmakers are introducing some bills for the 2026 session aimed at expanding water and sewer access. Rep. Joe Sweeney, a Salem Republican, is bringing forward legislation to enable “special assessment districts” that could allow municipalities to pay for infrastructure improvements through special tax arrangements on developers. Rep. Chris Muns, a Hampton Democrat, has introduced a bill to levy a statewide tax on second homes to pay for housing funding. And Rep. Daniel Veilleux, an Amherst Democrat, is sponsoring legislation “encouraging municipalities with sewage systems to extend system service to neighboring communities.”
The NHMA opposed many of the zoning overhaul laws signed by Ayotte this year, arguing that municipalities should be allowed to move forward on housing intentionally. That should be ideally be done by creating a master plan for new developments and orienting any needed infrastructure upgrades to that plan, Deshaies says.
But on the question of water and sewer, housing advocates and municipalities appear to agree. 
“It might seem as if we got rid of all this ‘red tape’ and that’s going to incentivize building,” said Deshaies. “Without the infrastructure, these units still aren’t going to get built.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sewer-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-01 05:56:42.597460

The Arkansas State Board of Education released both sets of proposed rules for public comment in November. The public meetings are scheduled for 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. Tuesday at the Arkansas Department of Education’s auditorium, which is located at 4 Capitol Mall.
The Educational Freedom Account program, which was created through the LEARNS Act in 2023, allows state funds to be used for allowable education expenses, such as private school tuition, extracurricular activities and technological devices. The program was phased in over three years with increasing eligibility. It opened to all students for the first time this fall. 
Arkansas education board releases revised school voucher program rules for public comment

EFA students receive up to 90% of the annual per-student public school funding rate. For the 2025-2026 school year, EFA participants may each be allotted up to $6,864 in state funding. 
Revisions to the EFA program rules include defining universal eligibility, establishing a fixed application window, revising payment schedules and administrative fees, and clarifying qualifying expenses. 
Changes to the rules incorporate provisions of Act 920 of 2025, which prohibits EFA participants from using more than 25% of their allocated funds for extracurricular activities, physical education activities or educational field trips within the state of Arkansas. 
Extracurricular activities don’t include “team sports or club sports,” according to the revised rules, which also explicitly exclude EFA funds from being used for equipment, recreational fees, travel costs and dues.
State education board members expressed concern at November’s meeting that the rules would prohibit students from using EFA funds for school-sponsored sports teams. Education department staff said they anticipated the rules would generate a lot of public comment, which led to the department scheduling two public meetings. 
At both meetings, Arkansans can also share their thoughts on rules for the Arkansas Adult Diploma program, which is for adults who don’t have a high school diploma, but are not seeking a GED. Changes to these rules include amending the definition of milestones and clarifying the payment associated with each milestone. 
The public comment period lasts 30 days, and if there are “substantive changes,” the rules will be revised and sent out again for another public comment period. Once the public comment process has concluded, a final draft of the rules will be presented to the education board for approval. The rules will then advance to the Arkansas Legislative Council for final approval. 
The current public comment period closes on Dec. 16. Those who cannot attend Tuesday’s meetings may submit comments to the education department by emailing ADE.RulesComments@ade.arkansas.gov.
Drafts of the pending rules and details about the public comment period are available on the education department’s website.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio lawmakers introduced tweaks last month to a bill effectively prohibiting many immigrants from owning land in the state. Those changes include carveouts for green card holders and those who have served in the armed forces. But opponents don’t see the changes as much of an improvement.
The restrictions apply to people from countries designated as foreign adversaries. That list, compiled by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, includes China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.
As part of Ohio’s 2023 state operating budget, Gov. DeWine allowed restrictions on foreign farmland ownership but refused to apply the same prohibitions to land within 25 miles of military installations. Ohio House Bill 1 revives those vetoed provisions and expands them to include critical infrastructure.
The sponsors’ stated concern is that allowing foreign governments, businesses, and agents to buy land nearby leaves the U.S. vulnerable to spying or sabotage.
“As legislators,” state Rep. Angie King, R-Celina, said when she introduced the bill, “we have a responsibility to protect Ohio from those who seek to undermine and destroy our American values and way of life.”
But critics, including civil rights groups and scores of immigrants from targeted countries, contend the bill is exceptionally harsh. The measure relies on a definition of critical infrastructure that includes large, discrete facilities like power plants, dams, and refineries, but it also extends to vast power and communication networks. For instance, every telephone and utility pole, the lines that run between them, and every cell tower fit squarely within that definition.
The changes
Barring ownership within 25 miles, as the original bill did, leaves little if any land in Ohio available. The amendment in the Ohio House reduced that limitation to 10 miles. But opponents say, with such an expansive list, even a one-mile ban “would render significant portions of Ohio inaccessible for families and businesses.”
In addition to reducing the radius of the bill’s exclusion zone, the amendment provides exemptions for legal permanent residents and people who have served or are serving in the military.
The changes also provide protection for property willed to someone, as well as property used to retire outstanding debts.
County prosecutors raised concerns early on about taking on potentially complex cases. “Without additional resources these cases will take time away from the core responsibilities of county prosecutors,” Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association Executive Director Lou Tobin said. The amendment includes a provision giving county prosecutors the ability to hand cases off to the state attorney general if they don’t have the resources to pursue them.
The bill grandfathers land already owned by individuals who would otherwise be prohibiting from ownership, but bars them from acquiring any other property. Should the measure take effect, anyone who becomes subject to the bill in the future would have to sell their property within two years.
In a joint statement, The Asian American Coalition of Ohio, Ohio Chinese American Association, and Justice for Ohio, acknowledged that narrowing the bill’s scope shows lawmakers are hearing them, but they insisted the changes don’t go nearly far enough.
The bill continues to discriminate against people in the U.S. lawfully, the groups said, based solely on their national origin — one of the seven protected characteristics laid out in the federal Fair Housing Act.
The bill also “conflicts directly with established U.S. and Ohio laws governing property ownership, due process and equal protection,” the groups added. Not only does the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution require equal protection, but Article 1 Section 1 of the Ohio Constitution includes “acquiring, possessing, and protecting property” among all individuals’ inalienable rights.
The groups noted as well that the prohibitions would discourage legitimate investment in the state.
“At a moment when Ohio is striving to attract advanced manufacturing, strengthen its workforce, and deepen international partnerships, H.B. 1 sends a damaging and counterproductive message,” they wrote.
As for the newly proposed 10-mile exclusion radius, the groups said, “no evidence has been presented that these sweeping geographic bans improve national security or public safety.”
After the amendment was introduced, state Rep. Juanita Brent, D-Cleveland, pressed supporters to provide a map of the state showing what property is and isn’t excluded. The chair, state Rep. Cindy Abrams, R-Harrison, made no promises, but said she’d ask the sponsors if they have one.
Just before the committee adopted the amendment, state Rep. Cecil Thomas, D-Cincinnati, objected.
“Obviously, it’s discriminatory, in my opinion, on its face,” he said of the bill.
“In my opinion, this particular bill will weaken Ohio’s economy and competitiveness, basically creating an environment that certain individuals or businesses from certain origins of the world are not welcome,” he said. “This bill would clearly create a potential for racial profiling and create a question of equal protection under the law.”

(Photo by Kate Brindley/New Hampshire Bulletin)We take voting seriously in New Hampshire, traditionally the first state to hold presidential elections every four years. A new report from the New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights should alarm anyone concerned about voting fraud or voters’ rights in our state or elsewhere in the United States.
In the first elections since Republican state legislators passed a strict new voter registration law, hundreds of voters were turned away on election days in New Hampshire in 2025. These appear to be eligible voters who just didn’t have the right identification with them. And the damage is only beginning. Married women, especially, may be blocked from voting in the mid-term elections in 2026 unless legislators rescind these unnecessarily strict regulations.
Before New Hampshire Republicans passed House Bill 1659, unregistered voters who showed up on election day could sign an affidavit saying they’re eligible to vote, and their ballot wouldn’t be counted until they provided citizenship evidence within two weeks.
Now, unregistered voters who show up on election day must bring a passport, birth certificate, or naturalization papers to prove citizenship. If they have ever changed their name — as have 8 in 10 women in opposite-sex marriages — they must bring a passport, birth certificate, or naturalization papers. But the birth certificates of married women may no longer match the name they use today. And in New Hampshire, approximately 45% of citizens do not have a passport.
If you forget to bring these documents or you can’t get them before the polls close, you can’t vote.
Why is this a problem? The New Hampshire Campaign for Voting Rights counted up the number of voters turned away under the new law in 2025, a year with only a smattering of local, low-turnout elections around the state. In all, 244 people who were trying to vote were denied, the New Hampshire Bulletin reported. Imagine how that number could skyrocket in a big election year like 2026, with state and federal elections ahead.
But how do we know if those 244 people were legitimate voters? Is the law actually working like it was supposed to, and just excluding fraudsters? Not likely. Consider this: The Heritage Foundation, an ultra-conservative organization, tracks the number of fraudulent voting convictions. In the last 10 years, from 2015 through 2024, they found only 22 cases in New Hampshire. The new voting law turned away more than 10 times that many in just one year.
Using the Heritage Foundation data, fraudulent votes average about two per year. The onerous law in New Hampshire turned away more than 100 times that many potential voters in a year. New Hampshire’s law boomeranged and is hitting legitimate voters in the face.
Republicans in the State House need to fix this, and fast. They’re not just blocking voters, they’re wasting state money by having the attorney general try to defend this potentially unconstitutional law against a lawsuit filed in federal court by voting-rights organizations.
And it’s not just an issue in New Hampshire. The U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 22, which would produce many of the same problems if it gets past the Senate. Republicans behind that bill ironically named it the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act.
Enough with the hypocrisy. We now know what these overly strict voter-registration laws do, whether they intended to or not. They don’t safeguard voters’ rights. They block them.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/votingregbills-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-01 04:56:21.229167

In September, Gov. Mike DeWine announced the start of the $10 million Child Care Cred Program. 
It’s available to families making between 200% and 400% of federal poverty guidelines. For a family of three, that’s $53,300 to $106,600 a year.
Under it, employees cover 40% of child care costs, employers cover 40% and the state covers the remainder.
“The new Child Care Cred Program is designed to help Ohio’s families get access to child care,” DeWine said in a written statement announcing the program. “And, when parents have quality childc are, Ohio’s employers have productive employees who are not worried about their kids during work. It is a win for Ohio’s working families and for businesses.”
Most economists surveyed about the program said it would be good for kids specifically.
Asked if the program would improve educational outcomes in Ohio, 13 said it would, three said it wouldn’t and three were uncertain, according to the survey, conducted by Scioto Analysis.
Many who agreed cited the quality of professional child care.
“There is pretty strong evidence that attending a quality daycare causes increased school performance, especially initially, and wages later in life,” David Brasington of the University of Cincinnati wrote in the comment section of the survey.
Meanwhile, his colleague, Michael Jones of the same university, made a counterargument.
“A growing body of research shows that mothers who spend more time at home with their young children, rather than rushing back to work, see better outcomes for both themselves and their children,” he wrote, later adding, “Ohio shouldn’t be creating incentives that encourage parents to spend less time with their children.”
An economist who was uncertain whether the program will benefit kids cited the small amount the state budgeted for it — $10 million. Compare that to the $600 million the legislature is giving the billionaire Haslam family to move the hapless Browns out of Cleveland. 
“I think that quality child care would improve educational outcomes but I am skeptical of this particular program,” wrote Curtis Reynolds of Kent State University. “It is a low amount of funding, it is not clear how many firms will participate and it does not last long. Could be an interesting ‘pilot’ but would need to be expanded to see effects.”
The economists were highly skeptical that work requirements for publicly funded child care would reduce unemployment rates. Just three said they would, nine said they wouldn’t, and seven were uncertain.
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act seeks to cut nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending over 10 years, including through such work requirements. But research has shown that state-level programs cost people their benefits without having any impact on employment.
In terms of work requirements for Ohio’s child care benefit, Charles Kroncke of Mt. St. Joseph University said hassling families away from using it would undermine the program.
“Work requirements are a bureaucratic hurdle that will make child care less accessible to the people that need it most,” he wrote.
And Kevin Egan of the University of Toledo seemed to say the requirement was nonsensical.
“Why would you need work requirements for child care?” he wrote. “Parents only pay for child care when they are working.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/child-care-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-12-01 04:56:21.229167

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Coldwater residents have learned a valuable lesson: Actions have consequences.
Their town’s twice-elected mayor, Joe Ceballos, has been charged with felony voter fraud by Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach. Ceballos appears to have registered and cast ballots in multiple elections, despite not being a citizen. While you might expect townsfolk to respond with anger, that’s not the situation at all.
Indeed, a remarkable profile of Ceballos by veteran Kansas journalist Roy Wenzl shows a town shocked that such a good guy — “He’s more American than I am,” a friend said — would be charged. He’s a die-hard Republican in a place full of them. More than 83% of Comanche County voters picked Donald Trump for president last year. More than 78% appear to have chosen Kobach in 2022.
“If deportation happens, I can tell you that Kobach will have trouble showing up here, especially if he asks to stay with us for a while,” said Dennis Swayze, a rancher who mentored Ceballos.
But the attorney general hasn’t done anything wrong here. Kansas voters know precisely where Kobach stands and what he means to do. They have voted for him repeatedly. Trump, likewise, made no secret of his desire to oversee the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. Violent or nonviolent, with legal status or not, immigrants would be targeted.
That’s what Kobach and Trump promised.
Trump on immigrants in late 2023: “They let — I think the real number is 15, 16 million people into our country. When they do that, we got a lot of work to do. They’re poisoning the blood of our country.”
Kobach just last month on the Coldwater case: “It still effectively takes the vote away or cancels the vote of a U.S. citizen.”
Most town residents voted for these men. Whether they realize it or not, they’re getting what they wanted. On Election Day, they chose cruelty.
Expressions of dazed disbelief punctuate Wenzl’s story like infuriating landmines: “If you know Joe, you know Kobach picked the wrong guy” “Deportation would be, as I told Joe, like sending me to Egypt.” “He doesn’t take anything about America for granted.”
Residents who know Ceballos agonized about his voter registration, wondering if they should have provided better guidance. He made an honest mistake back in 1991, they say, and the mayor shouldn’t be made to pay the price.
But as they agonized, none appears to make the leap that their blind allegiance to a party that demonizes immigrants might have contributed to the problem.
Even today, even after these events, Ceballos’ friend Ryan Swayze offered this thumbnail political analysis: “Democrats think the government provides, while Republicans think the government should let us just do our thing.”
Republicans just let them do their thing, huh? Not in this case!
Here are some hard truths for the people of Coldwater.
As sure as if every Republican voter of Coldwater lined up to cast a stone at Ceballos, their choices at the ballot box in 2024 and 2022 had the same traumatic effect. They did this to their friend. They did this to their mayor. They did this to their beloved town fixture. And until they figure this out, our country and our state is not going to get better.
Take responsibility. Own up to your actions.
People whose brains have been liquefied by conservative propaganda believe they’re never to blame for adverse consequences. Setbacks always must be the doing of nefarious leftists. They’ve been turned into perpetual victims, always losing to a Clinton or an Obama or a Soros. But, of course, the fact is they’re part of one of the most successful political movements in American history. That political movement has goals and policies that are meant to be enacted.
If you demand responsibility and accountability from others, you must be willing to demand it from yourself as well. Follow conservative Republican beliefs to their logical conclusion and you will see many more good people punished for honest mistakes.
I didn’t feel great after reading Wenzl’s story. The mayor has all but admitted to the charges against him and said he voted in practically every election over the past 30-some years. If convicted of a felony, he seems likely to face deportation. Removal from the country could happen anyway, his lawyer fears.
That will leave Coldwater, Kansas and the United States all worse off. I sympathize with the mayor and wish state officials could show more empathy.
But that’s not what the majority of the public wanted. That’s not what Coldwater voted for. They should sit with that shame.
To paraphrase Walt Kelly: They have met the enemy and he is them.

(Courtesy of Holiday Lights Festival)Another “season” is upon us. Whether yours is a wish for a cool Yule, a joyous Kwanzaa, a happy Hanukkah or simply for the celebratory furor to be over without incident, December also comes with questions for Nebraska’s Congressional delegation. Thus we offer another hypothetical news conference for the Cornhusker quintet. 
Without further holiday ado, let’s unwrap some queries …

The White House has recently cut tariffs on foods such as coffee, beef, and some fruits and vegetables because of high prices, a move that runs counter to the administration’s notion that American consumers will not bear the brunt of increased import levies. Do you still believe we need to keep using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which takes the Constitutional requirement of setting tariffs out of your hands as members of Congress and puts it in the president’s? If so, could you explain what the emergency is?


Are you comfortable with the peace plan the administration is offering to end the war in Ukraine and the process by which it came about, given the short deadline for Ukraine to accept its points, the confusion surrounding its source and, most importantly, as was originally reported, the clear indication that it heavily favored Russia, who, as you recall, started the war?


What are your thoughts concerning the war in Gaza, especially since, according to the United Nations, nearly 340 Palestinian civilians, including 70 children, have died in Israeli bombings since an Oct. 25 cease-fire and peace plan took effect?


While the Senate met during the government shutdown, the House was adjourned for 54 days during most of which an Arizona Congressional district was without representation as Speaker Mike Johnson refused to swear her in. Even factoring in your “district work periods,” according to the 2025 calendar, the House was adjourned for nearly a third of its scheduled time in session. What message do you think that sends?


At the direction of Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert Kennedy Jr., the CDC has dredged from the dark corners of conspiracy

theories the debunked notion that vaccines cause autism. It has changed its web site to read “The claim ‘vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim, because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.” Aside from any fallacies of logic involved — not to mention the more recent unproven claims about Tylenol — could you explain why a nation consistently on the cutting edge of scientific and medical progress would wallow in such misinformation? What might your role as a political leader be in reinforcing settled science?


At an Oval Office press gaggle during a visit from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, the president threatened a television network’s license because its reporter asked a question about a Washington Post columnist’s murder, which the CIA has determined the crown prince ordered. This came on the heels of the president calling a female reporter “Piggy” as she attempted to ask the president a question aboard Air Force One. Were either of those exchanges acceptable and, in the larger sense, what is acceptable to you in the give and take between reporters and political leaders?


This question needs a little perspective, so please bear with me: Viola Fletcher, known affectionately as “Mother Fletcher,” died last week at the age 111. As you may know, she was the oldest living survivor of the Tulsa Massacre, the riot in which white mobs killed 300 Black Tulsans, injured another 800 people and left 9,000 homeless. Fletcher’s death reminds us of the White House’s push to eliminate anything it believes smacks of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) or, in its mind, is “divisive.” The policy has led to the removal of books, commemorations, curriculums and other remembrances of Black Americans from public spaces. Indeed, plaques commemorating Black soldiers who fought the Nazis in World War II were recently removed from a Netherlands cemetery where 174 of them are buried. How, in your mind, do these efforts to appease anti-DEI forces square with actual history?


Curious about how much — if at all — it bothers you that no evidence has been provided to determine whether any of the boats we have destroyed in the Atlantic and Pacific were actually carrying drugs and, if so, were their fuel capacities large enough to make it to the U.S.


Should the FBI be interviewing six members of Congress for saying something that is already said to military personnel during training and is protected under the Constitution’s Speech and Debate Clause?

For small business owners, AI is no longer a buzzword — it’s becoming a cornerstone of business strategy.AI tools drive innovation, efficiency and growth, making them essential for staying competitive in an increasingly digital and data-driven world. According to JPMorgan Chase’s 2025 Business Leaders Outlook Survey, a strong majority (80%) of small business leaders are already using or are planning to implement AI. However, almost half (46%) are cautiously optimistic about its impact on their business. This year, 48% of small business owners plan to integrate AI tools, focusing on customer-facing applications like chatbots and customer service automation. Continued investment in AI and technology to enhance efficiency and competitiveness is a priority for this year and beyond.Emerging technologies are among key considerations for small business owners planning for the future, ensuring business continuity, fostering growth and planning for successful transitions.
The Potential of AI
AI offers capabilities in learning, reasoning and problem-solving. In the Survey, small business owners identified several key applications for AI, including marketing and content creation, customer service automation and data analysis. AI can also benefit payment processes and other operational automation.Large Language Models, a subset of AI, excel in processing and generating human-like text, making them invaluable for content creation and customer interaction. Integrating these technologies can streamline processes and boost productivity.
Why Emerging Technologies Could Benefit Small Businesses
With limited resources, small business can automate routine tasks with AI, allowing employees to focus on higher-value activities. AI-driven chatbots can manage initial customer requests, reducing the workload on customer service teams and improving response times, ultimately increasing customer satisfaction.
Additionally, AI can empower startups to expand operations by complementing their existing workforce. For instance, an e-commerce startup can use AI to efficiently manage inventory, process orders and assist with customer inquiries, allowing the team to focus on strategic growth and customer engagement.
Small businesses can also develop tools tailored to their needs, rather than relying on broad third-party solutions. This approach offers greater flexibility, easier integration and tighter control over data.
Automation tools enhance efficiency, while data-driven solutions like Chase for Business’s Customer Insights – a business intelligence tool that generates actionable insights from anonymized, aggregated data – help streamline operations and enhance the bottom line.
The Path Forward As innovations continue to emerge rapidly, consider developing a blueprint to identify where AI adds value, creating a roadmap for implementation and investing in the necessary infrastructure and talent. As you plan for growth and scaling, understand transition options to ensure a successful small business future.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/27081755/9-Photo-Harnessing-Emerging-Technologies-to-Power-Your-Business.jpg.jpeg,,,2025-12-01 02:58:21.499906

The values cited have mostly to do with gender roles and sexuality: women should submit to their husbands and embrace childbearing and childcare as their primary functions; gender identity variability is unbiblical and corrosive to morality; and a godless society is doomed to collapse.

John Hall
These claims are not new; we have heard them coming from conservative Christians over the past 50 or even 150 years. What is new, and surprising, is that these same citizens have turned their religious zeal into devotion to a political demagogue, dismissing  glaring moral flaws they once held to be disqualifying. The common ground between religious fundamentalism and our government’s authoritarian character is disdain and anger toward secular liberals, intellectual and economic elites who, so the argument goes, hate America and are the cause of our problems.
But what we have is not a reasonable, civil discourse on political science. It’s a deluge of bizarre disagreements or plain lies about simple facts, even when evidence supporting the facts is clear and compelling. Deeper still is a tangle of emotions arising from loss following rapid cultural and economic change: anger, alienation, fear of more loss, and changes in the status of racial and class groups. To unravel it all is beyond the scope of this essay, but some constructive light may be shed by reflecting on another period of cultural, religious, and intellectual change.
Our nation’s founders were generally cautious, if not downright skeptical, when it came to religious enthusiasm and divisive sectarian claims. Still fresh in the public memory were the demonization and torture of religious “heretics” and “witches” in the colonies. 
Before that were the senseless religious wars and chaos of 16th and 17th century Europe. The leaders of the constitutional convention were Deists —Enlightenment rationalists who conceived of God as the creator who set the cosmos in motion, then left it alone without subsequent intervention. This view relegated God to more of a supporting role on the stage of the human drama —a God that was providential but not in charge of the details. The authority of the Bible was starting to fray, as scholars struggled with its miraculous and mythological content.
With the publication of Darwin’s On the Origin of Species in 1859, religion in the western world faced a more singular crisis. The book popularized hard evidence that God had not created all forms of life during seven days, but that life had evolved gradually over a much longer timespan. Many clergy and other opinion-makers accepted the new time scale, taking the position that God drove the process of evolution itself, though that suggested that God was something more abstract, not the human-like God who made Adam from the mud and Eve from a rib. 
More conservative defenders of the faith opposed the fact of evolution bluntly, using theatrical slogans such as “man didn’t come from apes.” But after some decades, the scientific community and members of the public who took the time to understand the evidence for Darwin’s theory accepted evolution as a compelling explanation for the diversity of life and its ongoing changes.  The wobbly legs of Biblical authority were now disturbingly visible.
Protestant fundamentalism was born in the late 19th century as a reaction to Darwin’s book and a bulwark against this erosion of Biblical authority and the related threat to Christians’ cultural status. Fundamentalist leaders proclaimed a strategic retreat, a refusal to engage in evidence-based debate about religious truth. The party line was simple: true believers should not be tempted by the rational conceits of a fallen and godless world, exemplified by university scholars, including Biblical scholars. The Bible was the inerrant Word of God, period. 
Any so-called “evidence” that the earth was millions or billions of years old was not admissible in the court of God’s judgment. Even today, some congregations have an unspoken covenant to reject the theory of evolution as an attack on faith. Some Christians even reject the specific findings of geologists, proposing that God planted a deceptive fossil record in the layers of mountain rock to test our faith.
But there is another reason why evolution was and still is such a key concept when it comes to understanding fundamentalist religion. If life evolved as a succession of atoms, bigger atoms, molecules, self-replicating molecules, and up the evolutionary tree to intelligent animals, culture, and technology, then religions evolved too. That suggests that the Bible did not come straight from God fully formed, but rather evolved through a succession of beliefs, rituals, and earlier texts —like everything else in human culture, all of it going back to the primal soup. Of course, we have ample textual evidence that the Bible did evolve, but to concede that, for some, was to lose the game entirely.
Evolution is, for some religionists, an inconvenient fact because it legitimizes change and complicates the search for absolutes. Denying evolution, on the other hand, serves as a balm for those most hurt by rapid social change and who long to reverse that change. Autocracies thrive when large segments of the population have experienced loss of community pride, economic viability, and status when compared to others who were luckier. For autocrats, facts simply get in the way of delegitimizing critics’ expertise and capitalizing on loss and anger to seduce segments of the population into believing that the situation is hopeless without the authoritarian’s exercise of power. In our present case, religious fundamentalists and the allies of autocracy find unity in opposing their stated common enemy: secular liberals.
But facts are not something we can afford to ignore. And the demonization of those who see the world differently is not a path to healing our society and solving problems in ways we can all live with. 
Religion tempered by reason enriches people’s lives in many ways —providing space where people can belong, reminding us of our fallibilities, and helping us not to despair of our certain death. But religion, like any absorption in an ideological or utopian vision, involves some degree of magical thinking. It is not an appropriate tool when it comes to vaccine safety, just as ignoring the facts about tariffs and using them to exercise imagined grievance will not help us manage the economy.
We occupy a crowded planet, changing fast due to accelerating technology. Our challenges call for complex strategies anchored in the physical world to generate food and energy, avoid disease, keep the peace, and minimize the damage we do to the life around us. Depending on a God, a demagogue, or an ideology to save us from our own appetites and impulses is not a serious plan for self-government. 
It’s up to all of us, hearing each other, understanding each other more deeply, and evaluating various policy prescriptions in search of solutions. That is the messy, difficult, and essential struggle of democracy.

Perhaps [[...]","Florida's Capitol, Jan. 6, 2021. (Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)Ever get the feeling the Florida Legislature hates you?
It does.
Unless you’re a developer, a lobbyist, or a fetus.
Members are filing hell-born bills for the 2026 session, many apparently designed to torment you, rob your children of their futures, and reduce this state to an ICE-filled, disease ridden, constantly flooding, unaffordable autocracy.
Perhaps you cherish Florida’s natural beauty: the trees, the springs, the beaches, the wetlands.
Enjoy them while you can.
Sen. Stan McClain, R-Ocala, has filed a bill to forbid local government regulation of, and restrictions on, development.
SB 208 would allow all manner of unrestricted housing to be built wherever, whenever, even if the city objects because, say, it violates their comp plans, harms the character of a neighborhood, or pollutes.
You will not be shocked to learn Sen. McClain’s profession is “residential contractor.”
It gets worse: HB 479 would ensure sprawl, clear-cutting, and wetlands destruction can proceed unimpeded by any city or county trying to manage growth or protect local quality of life.
Environmental watchdogs call it “one of the worst water bills” they’ve ever seen.
This stinker’s sponsor is Rep. Randy Maggard of Pasco County. He may have been inspired by his nephew’s desire to build a house in Dade City’s La Jovita Golf and Country Club community, where homeowners pride themselves on living in harmony with wildlife.
As reported by Craig Pittman, it seems Zach Maggard broke an impressive number of rules, running a concrete boat ramp through wetlands and chopping down protected trees.
The project disappeared a bald eagle nest. Naturally, he suffered no consequences.
Next thing you know, his uncle is working to kneecap those pesky ordinances so everybody can go wild monetizing every inch of ground.
If your town wants to protect the wetlands that mitigate flooding, filter your drinking water, and foster birds and fish, or perhaps want to stop a project that would rip out the mangroves that sequester carbon, reduce storm surge, and slow down erosion, or maybe refuse a permit for, say, a huge gas station on top of a cave system connected to one of the state’s most iconic springs, you’ll be flat out of luck.
Of course, the federal government might kill Florida before Florida can kill itself.
The Trump administration wants to narrow the definition of “Waters of the United States” — which are protected by the Clean Water Act — removing protections from 80% of the nation’s wetlands.
They also want to drill in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
Anybody remember the BP oil spill?
Control
There’s no aspect of human life the Legislature doesn’t mean to control.
You should not be LGBTQ. Or demonstrate support for LGBTQ people.
Once again, lawmakers want to ban Pride flags outside government buildings.
God forbid somebody display a piece of cloth with a rainbow, signifying inclusiveness and welcome.
“Historical” flags, the Confederate battle flag, for example, will be allowed — in case you’re wondering what Republicans really care about.
Like gay people and flags, women must also be highly regulated.
Sen. Erin Grall has, once again, got her “fetal personhood” bill past the Judiciary Committee.
SB 164 would allow parents to sue for damages over the death of a fetus deemed “wrongful,” even if the fetus couldn’t have survived outside the womb.
That fetus is an American citizen.
“Survivors” could try to recover “lost earnings” of what the bill calls the “unborn child,” defined as a “member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb,” maybe on the theory it might have grown up to become a movie star like George Clooney or start a company like Nvidia and be worth billions.
Grall has long pushed legislation to control women’s bodies.
When Florida passed a six-week abortion ban in 2023, Grall, a sponsor, said, “Abortion has touched every single one of us, and we should grieve for what we have done as a country.”
That incest victim, that 16-year-old who didn’t know she was pregnant until she was past the time limit, would probably disagree.
Since women no longer have reproductive freedom in the Free State of Florida, it might be best if they just refrain from having sex.
“Freedom” in Florida means freedom from compassion for the poor, freedom from learning, freedom from the consequences of racism and prejudice, and freedom from science-based medicine.
Our state surgeon general has decreed children don’t need to be vaccinated against hepatitis B, chickenpox, haemophilus type B, and pneumococcal conjugate virus to go to school.
Now he and Gov. Ron DeSantis want the Legislature to roll back other vaccine mandates, including polio, pertussis, measles, mumps, diptheria, and rubella.
If that’s not enough, Erin Grall has another bill to protect you from your own health.
SB 408 says that if you get a vaccine and it “harms” you, and if that vaccine was advertised in the state of Florida on TV, radio, in print, via product placement, or online influencers, you can sue the manufacturer.
The measure does not define “harm.” Is a sore arm or a low-grade fever “harm”?
Anaphylaxis? Death?
A serious allergic reaction to a vaccine is possible, but it’s vanishingly rare.
Much rarer than, say, getting severely sick or even dying because you think the jab is some evil plot to impair your precious bodily fluids.
This lawsuit nonsense isn’t about sound medicine. The thin (one page) bill might attract all manner of even more extreme amendments.
Go ahead, risk your kid’s health; let your kid become a walking disease factory.
Guns
And if your kid makes it to 18, why not let him or her buy a nice, scary gun?
After 17 died in the mass shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School on Valentine’s Day, 2018, the Florida Legislature did the right thing, passing a bill to limit the purchase of semi-automatic rifles to those 21 and up.
That bill, signed into law by noted liberal Rick Scott, was such an affront to the House of Representatives and their NRA overlords, they keep trying to roll it back.
For three years, House Republicans proposed repealing the law.
Why not go back to allowing 18-year olds to buy themselves a Smith & Wesson M&P 15, just like Nicholas Cruz did?
So far, the Senate has shut these bills down.
But this is Florida and 2026 is an election year, so who knows?
Taxes
Thank God for Republicans’ Klown Kar ideas for eliminating property taxes: a bit of comic relief in these dark days.
The Legislature will consider no fewer than eight proposals, one eliminating non-school taxes altogether (HJR 201), one phasing out non-school taxes over 10 years (HJR 203), another exempting Florida residents over 65 from non-school homestead taxes (HJR 205), yet another limiting assessed value to 3% over three years for homestead property and 15% for non-homestead property, also over three years (HJR 213).
And a partridge in a pear tree.
OK, that last one is made up, but you get the idea.
Ron DeSantis despises all of them.
(He despises a lot of things, but he really loathes what he sees as the House of Representatives’ gaggle of tax-cutting ideas).
The governor calls them “milquetoast,” unserious, and “weak.”
Speaker of the House Daniel Perez points out DeSantis “has not produced a plan on property taxes. Period.”
Perez adds, “I’ve personally reached out to share with him the House’s proposals and he has, so far, not wanted to engage in a conversation.”
A cynical person might suspect DeSantis might be running for higher office in 2028 and wants to claim he “liberated” Floridians from the terrible burden of paying for local police, fire services, libraries, parks, and road repair.
They all need to get a move on if they want to get one (or more!) of these bad ideas onto the 2026 ballot.
In any case, watching the Legislature and our testy governor duke it out will be entertaining, and God knows, we’ll need some fun come January.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_0102-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-01 00:56:30.859551
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-01 05:02:00+00:00,CT Mirror,World AIDS Day means asking who we still leave behind,Nikki Tehrani,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/01/world-aids-day-means-asking-who-we-still-leave-behind-nikki/,"HIV does not care about borders, documentation status, or visa categories. But our healthcare system does, deeply.","As a public health student, first in college, now in grad school, I’ve heard the same message in almost every class: progress isn’t real progress unless everyone moves forward. On World AIDS Day, I’m reminded of how far that ideal is from reality.
We celebrate enormous scientific breakthroughs, like this summer’s FDA approval of a twice-yearly HIV-prevention injection, yet the people who need these tools most rarely have access to them.
For refugee, migrant, and asylum-seeking communities globally, HIV risk is shaped by forces far beyond individual behavior. Displacement strips people of healthcare access, exposes them to sexual violence, and forces survival decisions no one should face.
 Women and girls are disproportionately harmed. These same pressures —trauma from displacement, unstable legal status, disrupted care, and chronic underinsurance—follow refugees long after they arrive here in Connecticut. Yet, we have almost no U.S.-specific data on these risks because we do not systematically track them. In Connecticut and throughout the U.S., access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and prevention tools like PrEP is closely tied to legal status. When treatment is delayed or interrupted, people develop AIDS and drug-resistant HIV strains emerge, creating a slew of avoidable public health threats. 
The painful irony is that HIV is now one of the most preventable and treatable infectious diseases on the planet. PrEP reduces HIV risk by more than 99%, and ART allows people to live long, healthy lives. Scientifically and financially, it is within reach to end HIV transmission–and subsequently, AIDS–altogether. But none of that matters if immigrant, asylum-seeking, and undocumented families can’t get near these medications. Barriers appear at every step: insurance eligibility rules, pharmacy refusals, complex paperwork, or simply the fear of interacting with institutions that could jeopardize someone’s status.
We don’t have to look beyond our own cities to see these consequences. New Haven’s refugee health and resettlement programs are closing after a $5 million federal funding cut, combined with new federal restrictions; another hit after years of reductions that began under the Trump administration and never fully reversed. In a city where 17% of residents are immigrants, most remain disconnected from HIV prevention and care. When our local resettlement agencies close, it’s not just case management that disappears. Healthcare access disappears with it.
Even programs meant to close gaps often unintentionally reinforce them. Yale New Haven Health’s Financial Assistance Program is open to all residents, but the administrative hurdles make it incredibly difficult and frustrating for many immigrant families to navigate. The Yale Refugee Health Program is a thoughtful, trauma-informed model staffed by committed clinicians, but it can only serve refugees who arrive through formal federal pathways. That excludes asylum seekers, whose cases may take years; humanitarian parolees; and undocumented families who arrived with the same need for safety and stability.
As someone new to the Northeast, living in New Haven often feels like its own version of A Tale of Two Cities. It’s not lost on me that I sit in classrooms at one of the wealthiest universities in the world, learning about cutting-edge HIV prevention tools and trials, and then walk outside into a community where many residents cannot access them at all. 
HIV does not care about borders, documentation status, or visa categories. But our healthcare system does, deeply. When we tie basic prevention and treatment to immigration status, we don’t just create illness; we undermine our own national goals to “end the HIV/AIDS epidemic.” We cannot claim progress while structurally excluding the very communities most in need.
The good news is that solutions exist, and Connecticut can adopt them. California created a statewide program offering PrEP regardless of insurance or immigration status. Some cities have adopted “don’t ask, don’t report” policies, ensuring clinics do not become de facto immigration enforcement sites. Connecticut could do the same. We could expand the state PrEP Assistance Program to cover all residents. We could support pharmacies and clinics in serving people without documentation. And we could restore state-level funding for resettlement agencies, because their absence leaves a gap no cutting-edge scientific breakthrough can fill.
World AIDS Day, December 1, should not be a moment of self-congratulation. It should be a reminder that epidemics, like HIV/AIDS, are social before they are biological. As the daughter and granddaughter of immigrants, I know what it means when systems quietly signal that certain people don’t count.
If we are truly serious about ending HIV in this state and this country, then everyone must have a seat at the table. Until refugees and migrants are fully included in prevention and care, not as an afterthought but as a priority, HIV/AIDS will remain a disease of exclusion. And as U.S. healthcare continues to show us, it is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.

(Photo Courtesy of Pam D'Angelo)When Chesapeake Bay governors and other leaders gather at the National Aquarium on Tuesday to consider the next bay clean-up agreement, they’ll be joined by leaders from several federally recognized Native American tribes in Virginia.
The tribal leaders will present a symbolic gift of wild rice, to represent growing a partnership between the tribes and state and federal leaders — who are about to spend seven months determining whether the tribes can have a seat at the table as decisions are made about the bay.
It’s taken almost a year for tribes to even get to this point.
“We’ve come such a long way from where we started — which was another absence, which was no conversation,” said Melissa Ann Ehrenreich, executive director of the Indigenous Conservation Council. The council was formed in 2022 to represent the seven Virginia tribes that gained federal recognition between 2015 and 2018.
The tribes formally asked to be included as signatories to the next bay agreement, only to run up against the layers of bureaucracy at the Bay Program that Ehrenreich concedes have proven stifling.
“It has been frustrating to participate at multiple different levels and feel like: ‘Wow, why couldn’t we have done this over the last year?’” Ehrenreich asked. “The bay can’t wait.”

The yearlong delay is partially about timing: The Bay Program is led by the executive council, which includes Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) and other governors in the watershed, who only convene once a year. At its last meeting, in Annapolis last December, the council only directed staff to revise the bay agreement — not to add signatories.
That was the reason cited in a June letter in response to the tribes.
A document going before the governors on Tuesday will give Bay Program officials the go-ahead to study tribal inclusion, and “develop recommendations by July 1, 2026, on how best to include tribes across the watershed in the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) partnership.”
That could include adding the tribes, or the ICC, to the Bay agreement as a signatory, on equal footing with Maryland and the other states, according to the document.
The document also states that officials “may prepare a draft memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the federally recognized tribes within the watershed outlining CBP partner expectations and commitments, recognizing budgetary and resource needs and constraints,” the document continues.
The tribes are approaching the Bay Program at a difficult juncture for the agreement.
The states in the watershed failed to reach pollution-cutting goals outlined in the previous agreement by 2025, forcing them back to the drawing board to revise their pact. After months of deliberation, the states and federal officials agreed to a 2040 deadline for those same pollution reductions.
The proposed new plan also updates a host of other goals, including for underwater grass acreage, wetland restoration and forest conservation. But some environmentalists have raised alarm that some of the goals were revised downward compared to the earlier version, making them easier for the bay states to achieve.
Even with a series of bay agreements dating back to the 1980s, improving conditions in the bay has proven a challenge. In the late ‘80s, water quality testing determined that 26.5% of the bay’s tidal waters met standards. Today, that number is 29.4%. Bay Program officials view it as a victory, since they’re up against climate change and increasing development and population in the watershed.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Not everyone agrees.
“The effort is expensive, and it’s failing. They’re not making any progress at all, hardly,” said Chief Frank Adams of the Upper Mattaponi Indian Tribe, an ICC member, in an interview last month. “Why keep doing the same thing over and over? Let’s try something else. Let’s include the Native cultural knowledge and Native people.”
Part of the problem is that East Coast states are unaccustomed to considering tribal governments, with federally recognized tribes a rarity, Adams said.
“This is the first time the state of Virginia has ever had a federally recognized tribe, and they didn’t know how to deal with us,” Adams said. “Up and down the East Coast and the states that are feeding into the Chesapeake Bay: Pennsylvania, Maryland, all the other states, have no federally recognized tribes, so it was not even a thought that they should include the sovereign nations of Virginia into the discussion.”
Adams argues that tribes have lots to contribute. After the Upper Mattaponi won federal recognition, for instance, an environmental department was the first to be established, using grant funding. Adams said the department now has five staff members and focuses on issues including battling invasive fish. Other Virginia tribes have taken a similar approach.
Tribal leaders said they were not expecting the Bay Program to have such a lengthy procedure for considering their inclusion.
“I just saw it as more walls of colonialism — that [they] had not had Indigenous people involved,” said Chief Anne Richardson of the Rappahannock Tribe, an ICC member, in a November interview.

“And they felt there was no need to have Indigenous people involved at that level, although all of our watersheds are feeding off of the bay, and we’ve stewarded the bay and these rivers for thousands of years — and did a good job, without the millions and billions of dollars that the government seems to be pouring into it now,” she said.
In fact, the very name of the Chesapeake Bay is derived from an Algonquian word, Chesapiooc.
“We just want a seat at the table, so that we have decision-making authority, just like everybody else that sits at the table,” Richardson said. “You would think in 2025 that wouldn’t be an issue, but obviously it is.”
Leaders at the Bay Program say they aren’t throwing hurdles in front of the tribes.
“It’s not a ‘no.’ And it’s not like if you miss this boat, we move on,” said Anna Killius, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, during an interview earlier this year. The commission is a signatory on the bay agreement which represents lawmakers from Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
In more recent comments, Bay Program officials said they’re optimistic about future discussions with the tribes.
“Indigenous communities in this region have thousands of years of insight into land and water management that the Chesapeake Bay Program can greatly benefit from as we continue our work to improve Chesapeake Bay water quality and wildlife,” said Leila Duman, bays restoration officer for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.
“Maryland is supportive of the efforts to include representatives from these communities more formally as part of the Chesapeake Bay Program,” Duman said. “We look forward to participating in the next steps.”
Virginia officials declined to comment through the Bay Program, but added that their sentiment is similar to Maryland’s.
Dan Coogan, a 20-year EPA veteran who was named Bay Program director in October, said the “EPA and the Bay Partners are working with those federally recognized tribal nations to develop recommendations on how best to include tribes across the watershed. EPA looks forward to this discussion at the upcoming Executive Council meeting.”

If the Virginia tribes were to win signatory status on the Bay agreement, and representation on the executive council, it would be a relatively rare occurrence in the United States, said Lauren Wiederkehr, a law student at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, who studied the issue as a summer law clerk this year for the Chesapeake Legal Alliance.
The closest analogy might be the Puget Sound Partnership in Washington, which currently includes two Indigenous representatives on its leadership council.
One of them is Russell Hepfer, 69, a member of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, who has been serving on the Puget Sound leadership council since 2014. Hepfer said that fishing rights treaties between tribes and state governments make inclusion more commonplace at groups like the Puget Sound Partnership.
He said it has also helped that he could follow in the footsteps of other tribal leaders, including Billy Frank Jr., a Nisqually tribal member and well-known activist for tribal fishing rights in the Pacific Northwest who served on the leadership council as well.
But just getting a seat on the leadership council wasn’t enough: It’s a constant battle to educate others in leadership about tribes and their roles, Hepfer said.
“When people leave, retire, or whatever happens, you have to re-educate the next person,” he said.
Hepfer, who has served on the tribal council of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe for 24 years, said he views that education as a personal mission.
“We’re still a second-class group, but we have to keep telling our story,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sept-2024-Bd-Mtg-Pamela-DAngelo-cropped-e1764531693957-1024x691.jpeg,,,2025-11-30 22:57:13.004635

(Photo by Lanny Hartmann)Maryland set a bold goal of 1.1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030. With just shy of 150,000 EVs registered as of October 2025, the state has ground to make up.
That growth depends on a public charging network that is reliable, affordable and widely available, especially for apartment and condo dwellers without home charging and for drivers crossing the state on longer trips. Public charging must keep pace. Yet a new regulation from the Maryland Department of Agriculture threatens to do the opposite.
Starting Jan. 1, 2026, every public charging station in Maryland that accepts payment must register with the state’s Weights and Measures program and pay a $150 annual fee. That is per port. A simple four-plug Level 2 station at a grocery store, office garage, or apartment complex now owes Maryland $600 a year just to remain in service.

The state calls it a registration fee. In practice, it operates as a $150-per-port tax, perhaps the highest in the nation. For comparison, Maryland charges gas stations only $20 to register each fuel dispenser. An EV charging plug now costs 7.5 times more to keep legal than a gasoline nozzle.
The Maryland Department of Agriculture is gearing up for enforcement. Chargers not registered by Jan. 1 face being red-tagged with a stop-use order. This removes the unit from service entirely. Every fix requires a registered service agency to sign off on repairs, and those technicians charge real money.
In spring 2026, state inspectors will arrive with certified test equipment to verify that each charger meters electricity within tolerances. New chargers must be certified before operating. The cost of compliance begins long before the first kilowatt-hour is sold.
Large fast-charging networks will simply take this in stride and raise rates a few cents. The damage falls hardest on low-margin Level 2 stations that drivers rely on daily. Apartment complexes, hotel lots, small retail centers, and office buildings often run these chargers at break-even or as customer perks.
A substantial yearly charger tax transforms a goodwill gesture into a financial liability. Many hosts will run the numbers, see red ink, and simply rip out the equipment rather than pass the cost to users or risk repeated red tags for minor violations.
Charger hosts lose the incentive to keep stations online. Drivers lose convenient charging options. The public charging network shrinks at the exact moment Maryland needs it to expand.
By 2026, compliant chargers will sport a little MDA decal proving they are registered. What many won’t see will be the faint outlines on the pavement where perfectly functional Level 2 chargers once stood, quietly removed because the juice just wasn’t worth the squeeze.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54918991226_f8b0d3035c_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-30 21:56:45.176857
,Mississippi Today,2025-12-01 01:07:24+00:00,Mississippi Today,"For Rebels’ new boss Pete Golding, the coaching bug first bit at Delta State",Rick Cleveland,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/30/pete-golding-ole-miss-delta-state/,"The new head football coach at Ole Miss, Pete Golding, is known as a strong recruiter who builds bonds with high school coaches and prospective players.","First things first: Pete Golding, the new head football coach at Ole Miss, could not be more different from his predecessor, Lane Kiffin. Put it this way: You will not likely find Golding spending his Oxford mornings in a hot yoga class.

You are more likely to find 41-year-old Golding on the phone with recruits, watching tape, doodling football plays or spending what spare time he has with wife, Carolyn, who has three degrees from Ole Miss, and their three children. Golding, the Rebels’ defensive coordinator, was promoted to head coach Sunday after Kiffin announced his own departure for LSU.
Said Scott Eyster, Golding’s childhood pal and football teammate at both Hammond High School in Louisiana and from 2002 to 2005 at Delta State University: “Pete told me a long, long time ago, when he first got into coaching, he was someday gonna be the head football coach at Ole Miss. I texted him congratulations today, that dreams really do come true. I am so happy for him. He had earned this. He has worked so hard for this. Ole Miss football is in good hands.”
Eyster, a four-time Conerly Trophy finalist, and Golding have been friends since they were in diapers. Their fathers coached football together at Hammond High. They took a recruiting visit together to Delta State, along with another Hammond teammate, Ryan Barker.
Rick Rhoades, the Delta State head coach at the time, remembers that visit vividly. 
“Ryan Barker, the center, was the player we really wanted,” Rhoades said. “He asked if he could bring two of his Hammond teammates along. One was Eyster, who turned into a great college quarterback, and the other was this little bitty fellow named Pete Golding.
“Back then, you could work players out on a recruiting visit and I put Pete through some drills,” Rhoades continued. “Once I saw him run, I told him, ‘Son, I don’t know how much scholarship money we have left, but whatever we have left is yours.’ He turned into a great player for us.”
Golding was a four-year starter at safety for really good Delta State teams. He remains third on the DSU career tackles list and fourth in career pass interceptions.
“Pete was just a little ball of energy,” Rhoades said. “And he had great football instincts. He always seemed to know where the ball was going. He was always a step ahead. When you recruit, you start with finding guys who really love football – not just the Saturday part, but the practice and the preparation and all that comes with it. That was Pete. He made an impact the first day and when he ran out of eligibility we corralled him and made a graduate assistant coach out of him. He’s smart as a whip. I knew he would make a great coach, and he has.”
Golding has earned the reputation of being a accomplished recruiter, no matter where he has coached, from Delta State, to Southeastern Louisiana, to Southern Miss, to Texas-San Antonio, to Alabama and now Ole Miss.
Said Eyster, “Recruiting comes naturally to Pete. He’s a people person. People gravitate towards him. He doesn’t meet a stranger”
Eyster’s words reminded this writer of a day three years ago at the state high school championships played that year in Hattiesburg at USM’s Roberts Stadium. Both Kiffin and Golding were there that day to recruit Suntarine Perkins, the best player in the state, from Raleigh. Dozens of coaches – Mississippi high school coaches and college football recruiters – were standing beyond the north end zone watching the game. At one end of the end zone was Kiffin, all alone, talking on his cellphone nearly the entire game. At the other end was Golding, who was constantly being greeted by Mississippi high school coaches. They all knew him and he them. I never saw Kiffin talk to anyone.
I told Eyster that story, and he laughed. “That’s Pete right there,” he said. “That’s why he recruits so well.”
Now then, all this doesn’t necessarily mean that Golding will become a successful big-time college football head coach. If I’ve learned anything in more than a half century of doing this, it’s that the biggest transition in coaching is from being a coordinator to becoming a head coach. Being the CEO – with all the management and distractions that come with it – isn’t for everyone. Time will tell with Golding.
This much does seem certain: Given the situation in which Ole Miss finds itself, Golding would appear by far the best choice to lead 11-1, sixth-ranked Rebels into the playoffs and beyond. His players appear to both love and respect him. The announcement of Golding’s promotion at a team meeting Sunday reportedly was greeted with loud, prolonged cheering from the players.
Said Keith Carter, the athletic director, “Today’s meeting was a clear indicator of Pete’s ability to galvanize our squad. All of our players and coaches are ecstatic and ready to lock arms for a playoff run.”
Carter also said that Golding “has demonstrated an exceptional football mind, but more than that has shown a deep understanding of our culture, values and what it means to be part of the Ole Miss family. Simply put, Pete is one of us.”
What Carter left unsaid is clear: Kiffin, for all his success, never felt like family at Ole Miss. His messy departure potentially could have torpedoed the program. 
For all Kiffin’s success – and his posturing –  he should have known there was no way Ole Miss would let LSU’s football coach lead Ole Miss into the playoffs. That was pure heresy, despite what all the ESPN talking heads would tell you. Far, far better to give the reins to a guy, Pete Golding, who has always wanted the job he now has.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/30180352/Ole-Miss-football-coach-Pete-Golding.jpg,,,2025-11-30 20:57:33.119330

(Photo by Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline) As students and workers resume their routines after the Thanksgiving holiday, Siembra NC is warning that the organization has received multiple credible reports to indicate that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is deploying more agents to the Raleigh area for a monthlong operation.
“While we know that this news might cause alarm, we have no sense that ICE is planning the kind of activity that we saw Border Patrol do,” said Siembra NC co-director Nikki Marín Baena in a Sunday call with reporters. “The report that we got is that 50 additional agents were going to be deployed to North Carolina for activity starting December 1st.”
Siembra NC co-director Nikki Marín Baena (Screen capture from webinar)
The grassroots immigrants rights organization has also had reports that ICE has reserved the same charter flights between Charlotte and Florida’s Jacksonville International Airport as they did last week, scheduled from Dec. 2 to Dec. 6.
Marín Baena declined to talk further about the origin of the information, and NC Newsline was not able to independently confirm it.
Marín Baena noted said the arrests ICE has typically made throughout this year have made it nearly impossible to get to school and work safely. Siembra NC launched the website Ojo Obrero in November to give communities a better sense of where federal enforcement activity has taken place.
“Businesses are being disrupted, classrooms are being disrupted, even people who have become naturalized U.S. citizens are doubting whether they are safe or thinking about what they need to do in the case of these operations,” Marín Baena said.
Many naturalized U.S. citizens and green card holders have started to carry their passports just to go grocery shopping.
“My own parents are naturalized U.S. citizens, and we had to talk about what would happen, what they should do, were they stopped by a border patrol agent,” Marín Baena said.
She believes the anticipated ICE’s operation in Raleigh comes as the result of remarks made by North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall. Last week, Hall told The News & Observer that ICE and the border patrol were doing important work.
“It looks like they’re doing a pretty good job at it right now. And so, we don’t have much to ask, other than to come back,” Hall said.
Siembra is encouraging North Carolinians who have been impacted by the recent detentions to contact Hall’s office.
“We think that they listen to their own campaign contributors. And so, a few key contributors to Speaker Dustin Hall include political action committees with the N.C. Home Builders Association, Duke Energy and Lowe’s Home Improvement,” said Marín Baena. “We are inviting people to write letters and create illustrated cards to Speaker Hall’s top campaign contributors, specifically explaining why children and their parents should not have to live in fear.”
For business owners who have closed because employees are sheltering in place, Siembra NC is inviting people to post placards explaining that they’re closed “Courtesy of Speaker Destin Hall.”

The organization has also suggested that immigrant workers who miss work because they are sheltering in place can send a “Destin Hall Pass” to their employer.
Hall said on social media that he supports the enforcement action and that Gov. Joh Stein should be “more concerned about the safety of our citizens than protecting criminal illegal aliens.” Hall also faulted Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden for blocking previous ICE detainers and putting undocumented immigrants back onto the streets.
“They’re stepping in to clean up his mess and restore safety to the city,” Hall said in a Nov. 17 post on X expressing support for the Border Patrol.
Over the holiday weekend, Homeland Security officials pivoted to focus on the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C.
President Donald Trump announced on Thanksgiving that he intends to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries.”
The five-day crackdown by Border Patrol in North Carolina resulted in 370 arrests.
Marín Baena said Sunday that many of those detained could eventually see charges dismissed.
“And we actually don’t know, of those 370 people, how many they’ve already had to let go because they were actually U.S. citizens or green card holders and how many they will have to let go because we’ve documented that they were unconstitutional arrests,” she said.
Marín Baena said she hopes that ICE’s plans change and it does not resume indiscriminate arrests in North Carolina in December. But if they do return, she says immigrant advocates are prepared.
“Thousands of people across the state of North Carolina have received training to get their neighbors safely to school, safely to work. And so, we are a little bit more prepared at this moment in time.”

(Photo courtesy of El Calvario).Eighteen New Mexico agribusinesses will receive a portion of a $3.5 million federal grant to strengthen”middle of the supply chain” operations in the state, according to a news release from the New Mexico Department of Agriculture.
The 18 recipients of the Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure grant are located throughout the state and include farms, farmers markets and other organizations that “increase capacity for processing, aggregation and distribution of local foods.”
The projects themselves range from construction, equipment purchases and facility expansion and must be completed by Dec. 16, 2026.

El Calvario United Methodist Church located in downtown Las Cruces will receive more than $383,000 from the grant to expand space they are currently leasing for the El Calvario Commercial Kitchen Incubator. Rev. George Miller, executive director of the Gastro Emprende Food Hub at El Calvario, told Source New Mexico that the food hub will be available for people who own a business in the food industry or want to start one, but need an area to prepare food.
Miller said the church has a commercial kitchen they used to serve food to people when they were supporting a short-term shelter. The church later opened the kitchen to people with credentials or are trying to work toward them to use, but the space is limited. 
“It kind of came out of our own experience, history of serving food to people,” Miller said. “And some of the clients we deal with are underserved populations, basically, or people without so much access or voice or [who are] discriminated [against]… That was just the people that were at our doorstep here in Las Cruces.”
The program has provided people in the area a place to foster their own businesses, enhance their skills and experiment with food products while also ensuring more New Mexico produced food is used, prepared and distributed.
Miller described it as an “economic development model,” and said current clients use the space to process chile, freeze dry food and develop new products. Plans are nearly complete on the new space, Miller said, and added that he expects the renovation could be completed within six months.
Other grant awardees include Corrales Classic Farms, Santa Fe Farmers Market and La Mesa Organic Farms in Dixon. According to the agriculture department’s release, La Mesa Organic Farms intends to upgrade a mobile kitchen and various processing equipment to increase heritage apple cider and blue corn product production, “expanding into more regional farmers markets while preserving traditional New Mexico foodways.”
“By investing in the middle of the supply chain, we’re helping New Mexico producers bring more local food to market and strengthening our state’s food system,” New Mexico Secretary of Agriculture Jeff Witte said in a statement.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in a statement that investing in such programs and projects will “ensure” food produced and processed in New Mexico remains in the state.
“Supporting our farmers, ranchers and food entrepreneurs is an investment in our economy, and in healthier communities and stronger connections between New Mexicans and the food grown here at home,” Lujan Grisham said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/foodsupply-1024x751.jpg,,,2025-11-30 18:57:24.552461

Athletic director Keith Carter said Golding would guide the sixth-ranked Rebels (11-1) “into the College Football Playoff,” which will release its 12-team bracket on Dec. 7. The announcement followed days of negotiations with Kiffin, who chose LSU over staying in Oxford.
“Coach Kiffin and I met yesterday, and he informed us that he is accepting the head coaching position at another school,” Carter said. “For our program to begin preparing for its future – both the short and long term, he will be stepping away from the team immediately.” 
Golding, a former Ole Miss player and longtime defensive specialist, acknowledged the challenge.
“Oxford is home, and it’s an incredible honor to lead one of the nation’s premier programs, and I can’t wait to get to work immediately and prepare this team to win a national championship,” Golding said. “Our mission moving forward is clear: we will play with toughness, discipline and relentless effort in everything we do.

Today, dozens of new docks are available for kids to share that same thrill, thanks to funding Smith helped create. 
South Dakota’s Habitat Stamp fee has become a cornerstone in the state’s strategy to improve wildlife habitat and expand public access for outdoor recreation since the stamp’s inception five years ago.
“It’s a small price to pay for the critters that were here long before we were,” Smith said. 

Former state Sen. V.J. Smith, a Republican from Brookings, holds up the “Legislator of the Year” award given to him by the South Dakota Wildlife Federation for his legislation that created the state’s Habitat Stamp program. (Photo courtesy of V.J. Smith)

The stamp is a required extra purchase of $10 for state residents and $25 for non-residents when buying a hunting, trapping or fishing license. It was instituted by the state Legislature and sponsored by Smith, of Brookings, who described it as “an insurance policy for the future” of the state’s outdoor heritage. 
Every dollar of the stamp is required by law to go toward wildlife habitat and public access projects. The stamp has raised $21.6 million in its first five years, and the state Department of Game, Fish and Parks has so far spent $14 million on about 1,300 projects. The money is divided roughly equally between water and land-based efforts.
The water projects have included rehabilitating aging dams, constructing and improving boat ramps and fishing piers, dredging and aerating lakes, and restoring habitats such as rock reefs and stream banks. 
On land, the department focuses on seeding native grasses and wildflowers, planting trees and shrubs, improving access roads and trails, and supporting programs that compensate private landowners who open their land to public recreation.
The stamp’s origins
After watching fellow lawmakers debate a one-time, $1 million transfer to a habitat fund in 2019, Smith said he and others saw the need for a permanent, self-funded solution. Surrounding states already had habitat and conservation fees tied to license sales. 
The next year, the stamp bill passed with bipartisan support. 
“The legislation would never have passed without the endorsement of the outdoor groups,” Smith said.
Smith said one of the key players was the Brookings area chapter of the South Dakota Wildlife Federation, including chapter member and retired state waterfowl biologist Spencer Vaa, who inspired Smith to introduce the bill. 
“He enlightened me on the needs of wildlife and the importance of habitat,” Smith said. “A lot of people deserve credit for this. You need a lot of people to get stuff done.”

Jeff Olson, of the Black Hills Sportsmen Club and Black Hills Flyfishers, said some hunters and anglers were initially skeptical of the stamp, and worried it might become “just another tax.” But five years later, he said the results speak for themselves.
Olson pointed to Pactola Reservoir, a popular man-made lake in the Black Hills, and the stamp-funded work local anglers and the department have been doing to add fish habitat structures and improve shoreline access below the reservoir. He said the projects help to make Rapid Creek, which feeds the lake and runs through Rapid City, a prime fishing spot. 
“We wouldn’t have been able to do a lot of the recent fisheries projects we’ve gotten done, like the one below Pactola Reservoir, without those stamp dollars,” Olson said.
Insurance policy for the future
Retired wildlife biologist George Vandel, who now lobbies in Pierre on behalf of the South Dakota Wildlife Federation, called the stamp “one of the smartest investments hunters and anglers have ever made.” 
Vandel said the fee pays for habitat and access improvements that would be “nearly impossible” to secure through South Dakota’s Legislature, where “it’s a fight” to secure funding. 
Nevertheless, a few concerns remain. Vandel mentioned an exemption that allows shooting‐preserve customers to avoid paying the fee. Those are privately owned and managed lands where pen-raised game birds (and sometimes other animals) are released to be shot by customers. He said that was a compromise made during the bill’s passage, with preserves arguing they do not impact wildlife numbers. Vandel wants to apply the fee to preserves and bring in more revenue for Habitat Stamp projects.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Some western South Dakota hunters and anglers, including Olson, say investments have been more concentrated in the eastern part of the state. Of the $14 million spent so far, $4.5 million was spent in western counties. 
Regardless, for outdoor enthusiasts, the narrative is clear: The annual fee provides a tangible return. As Vandel puts it, “The $10 you spend is half a box of shells or a six pack of beer. This is a direct return on your investment. There’s no administrative overhead, it’s just money on the ground.”
Vandel praised the stamp’s results, from new boat ramps and shoreline access to grassland and food-plot restoration. He also pointed to the public access programs as essential to maintaining hunting opportunities. 
“Sportsmen and women have to realize you get what you pay for, and if you want cheap, that’s exactly what you’ll end up with: less habitat, less access, and fewer game,” Vandel said. 
 



 Where the money goes

South Dakota’s Habitat Stamp has funded about 1,300 projects since the program began five years ago:

33.6 miles of new trails.
41 dams repaired.
3,000 acres of forest and grassland habitat enhancements.
41 fish-habitat structures built.
956 wildlife food plots created.
36 new docks and piers.
49 new boat ramps and launches.
5,000 acres of native prairie restored.
14.8 miles of wildlife-friendly fencing installed.
212,000 acres enrolled in public access to private land programs.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/EM8A3485-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-30 14:57:26.925169

April McClain Delaney, plus appointments in political notes.","Del. Kevin Harris (D-Charles and Prince George's) during a committee hearing in 2023, his first year in office. Harris won the nomination over the weekend to fill the District 27 Senate seat vacated recently by Michael Jackson. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The Calvert County Democratic Central Committee voted Saturday to endorse Del. Kevin Harris (D-Charles and Prince George’s) for the vacant District 27 Senate seat, giving Harris a sweep of all three counties in the district.
The final vote, according to Calvert Central Committee Chair Cindy Yoe, was seven votes for Harris and three votes for Jason Fowler, an attorney who ran unsuccessfully for the District 27C House seat in 2018.
The Calvert County vote follows Democrats in Charles County, who went 9-1 for Harris over Fowler last Saturday, and Prince George’s County Democrats, where the 26 central committee members present at Tuesday’s meeting cast 16 votes for Harris and 10 for Del. Jeffrie Long Jr. (D-Prince George’s and Calvert).
The Senate seat covers three House subdistricts that sprawl over the three counties: District 27A, currently held by Harris, includes parts of Charles and Prince George’s counties; District 27B, held by Long, includes parts of Prince George’s and Calvert counties; and District 27C, held by Republican Del. Mark Fisher, is all central Calvert County. All three counties had to weigh in on a nominee, which will be forwarded to the governor.
For those keeping score at home, Harris got 32 votes from the three counties to 10 for Long and four for Fowler. But the important number is 3-0: In an Oct. 21 letter, the attorney general’s office said that each county gets one vote in the selection of a nominee, and Harris got all three. The same letter said that if the counties were split, the majority would still win and only one name would be sent to the governor, so Harris essentially had the nomination sewed up on Tuesday.
The nomination now goes to Gov. Wes Moore (D), who has two weeks to officially appoint him to the Senate seat that was held by Democrat Michael Jackson until Nov. 11, when Jackson — a former Prince George’s County sheriff — took over as the new superintendent of the Maryland State Police.
Assuming Harris’ nomination is endorsed by Moore, the Democratic central committees in Charles and Prince George’s counties will have to meet again to nominate a replacement for the District 27A seat Harris, a first-term member of the House, is leaving behind. They’re on a tight schedule if they want a delegate seated in time for the Jan. 14 start of the 2026 legislative session.
Delaney to Trone to McClain Delaney to … Trone?

The only problem is incumbent Democratic Rep. April McClain Delaney has already announced her reelection bid and started lining up endorsements.
Attempts to reach Trone were unsuccessful. But Inside Elections’ Jacob Rubashkin first reported last week that there was a poll circulating in the district asking people how they would vote in a Democratic primary between Trone and McClain Delaney.
The 23-question poll obtained by Rubashkin asks boilerplate questions about registration and political leanings. It also asks how “appealing” the poll-taker finds McClain Delaney, after describing her as a representative who is “showing up everywhere to fight for hard-working Maryland families,” and Trone, after describing him as a congressman who “stood up against [President Donald] Trump’s abuses of power, voting to impeach him twice.”
But the poll rely leans into it in a series of questions that claim McClain Delaney has voted with Trump more often than any other Democrat in the Maryland delegation and questioning her votes on immigration and criminal justice reform, among others. A follow-up series of questions paint Trone as a relentless defender of Obamacare and abortion rights, and an opponent of Trump during his time in Congress.
McClain Delaney’s campaign responded with a statement noting that her reelection has already been endorsed by every Democrat in the state’s congressional delegation as well as “the Governor, the Lt Governor, the Attorney General … and she looks forward to continuing to fight for the progress needed by Maryland’s Sixth District at this critical moment.”
She has also racked up other endorsements, as well, from unions, environmental and reproductive rights groups, and political organizations like EMILYs List and the New Dems Action Fund, among others.

Tiernan Donohue, the chief campaigns officer for EMILYs List, noted in a statement that Trone, who founded Total Wine and More, spent $60 million of his own fortune in a failed 2024 Democratic primary bid against current Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.). She defended McClain Delaney’s record and said that, “Should Trone decide to run in 2026, Marylanders are going to once again reject his attempt to buy his way back into Congress.”
Should Trone run against McClain Delaney, it would pit two millionaire candidates against one another. In addition to Trone spending heavily on his own race in 2024, McClain Delaney loaned almost $3.9 million to her campaign last year, and has already loaned her campaign $400,000 this year, according to her latest Federal Election Commission filing. That report showed that McClain Delaney had $591,000 in cash on hand as of Sept. 30.
New faces at Governor’s Office for Children
The Governor’s Office for Children has tapped a former federal government official and a longtime worker in nonprofit organizations for key leadership roles in the office.
Special Secretary Carmen Martin said last week that Eric Morrisette will join the office as deputy secretary and Ojeda Hall-France will serve as executive director of the ENOUGH Initiative.
“Eric and Ojeda’s unparalleled experience serving families and communities will be vital to the state’s work in this critical moment,” Martin said in a statement announcing the appointments. “With experience championing transformational policy initiatives, building public-private partnerships, and creating positive change at the intersections between communities and government, Eric and Ojeda are proven leaders to meet this moment.”
Morrisette is the former acting under secretary at the U.S. Department of Commerce, where he led the Minority Business Development Agency, and where he previously served as chief of staff to the deputy secretary and deputy assistant secretary for legislative and intergovernmental affairs. He also worked in the U.S. House and Senate, and served in both analysis and operations at the CIA, according to Martin’s statement.
It said Morrisette will oversee the office’s policy priorities, including managing cross-agency initiatives to support children and boost economic mobility.

	Hall-France will oversee the administration of ENOUGH — Gov. Wes Moore’s Engaging Neighborhoods, Organizations, Unions, Governments and Households Initiative — having previously led a community organization participating in the ENOUGH program.
She most recently served as executive director of the Child First Authority, which supports 12 community Schools and eight out-of-school-time programs in Baltimore City, according to the statement, which praised her “rich background in community organizing, systems‑change leadership, and nonprofit management.” Hall-France has also been president of the One Love Foundation and spent more than a decade as a community organizer with the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF), the statement said.
Farlow named to Worcester District Court
Worcester County Assistant State’s Attorney Michael “Mike” Farlow has been appointed to a seat on the county’s district court, Gov. Wes Moore announced last week.
“Mike Farlow is a dedicated public servant whose career as a prosecutor and private attorney has prepared him well for the bench,” Moore’s statement said. “His commitment to the people of Worcester County, both in the courtroom and through his extensive community service, is a testament to the integrity and fairness he will bring to the district court. We are proud to see him serve in this new role.”
Farlow has been a prosecutor for the past seven years. Before that he was in private practice in Ocean Pines, where his practice concentrated on major traffic offenses, criminal law, asset forfeiture law, and wills and trusts, the governor’s office said. He also worked part-time as a prosecutor for the state’s attorney from 2003 to 2010.
Farlow, who ran unsuccessfully for state’s attorney in 2014, was the youngest elected official in Maryland when he was elected a Pittsville town commissioner at age 19. He has been recognized for his work with the Snow Hill Volunteer Fire Department and the Pittsville Volunteer Fire Department, and was recently inducted into the Maryland State Firemen’s Association Hall of Fame, according to the governor’s office. Farlow earned his law degree from the Widener University School of Law.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/DSC_0044-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-30 12:57:40.427799

The moment became one of the most important events in the Civil Rights movement of the mid-20th Century.
At the Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation, visitors can see the real bus where Rosa Parks made her historic decision. Museum leaders say the free admission day is a chance for families, students, and community members to learn more about her life and to think about how one person’s courage can spark big change. 
They hope people use the day to remember her strength, her kindness, and her lasting impact on both Montgomery and Detroit.

On December 1, 1955, Parks, a Black woman, was arrested after she refused to give up her seat to a white man. Her courage helped to start the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which became an important event in the Civil Rights movement. People across the country saw how unfair the bus rules were and began speaking out for equal rights.
Even though many people know Parks for what happened in Alabama, she also has a strong and important connection to Detroit. She moved to Detroit in 1957 and lived there for more than 40 years until her death in 2005.
David Hecker: Students should be taught the truth about Rosa Parks and other civil rights leaders

Former Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm on October 25, 2005, issued the following statement on the passing of Parks: 
“As the mother of the modern day civil rights movement, Rosa Parks will serve as a role model for generations to come,” Granholm said. “She embodied the courage that is so important to the world we live in.  Her quiet strength, dignity and persistence in the face of racial inequality and persecution were an inspiration to all Americans, regardless of race or gender.  We are proud that she adopted Michigan as her home, a place she loved as much as we will always love her.”
In Detroit, she kept working for justice. Parks worked for Congressman John Conyers, a Democrat, and helped people in the community every day. She supported youth groups, spoke out against poverty, and stood up against unfair housing rules and police violence.

Many Detroiters remember her not only as a national hero, but as someone who cared deeply about local families and young people.
In Detroit, several places honor her legacy. A U.S. Post Office is named after her, and the Transit Center in downtown Detroit also carries her name. These landmarks help people remember how Rosa Parks worked for fairness and equality throughout her life.

It is not just about technology; it’s about meeting people where they are and supporting them in ways that make sense for their lives. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Roz King: From libraries to lifelines, how Vermont reinvents rural health care.","This commentary is by Roz King, M.S.N., R.N., of South Burlington. She serves as the chief of research for the department of emergency medicine at the Larner College of Medicine. She is a clinical translational scientist whose work focuses on improving access to care and health outcomes in rural and underserved communities.


For families in Vermont’s rural towns, getting to a medical provider or clinic can be challenging. Long drives, limited transportation and busy work schedules often mean that health care takes a back seat, until a routine health need becomes something more serious.
As a clinical translational scientist and emergency medicine nurse, I see how these barriers affect people every day, and how creative, community-rooted solutions can make a lasting difference.  
Navigating state-level hospital oversight and evolving federal requirements can be complex and, at times, frustrating, but it also creates opportunities for new ways of delivering care. Emergency medicine thrives on thinking fast and adapting under pressure. It is this same mindset that is well-suited to addressing Vermont’s rural health care needs.
Across Vermont, we are finding ways to deliver care beyond the four walls of our institutions, through libraries, mobile clinics and interprofessional student-community partnerships. Sometimes the toughest constraints spark the most impactful ideas.
One example of this community-centered innovation is VITAL VT (Virtual Integration for Telehealth Access through Libraries in Vermont) funded by the Leahy Institute for Rural Partnerships. In many rural towns, broadband gaps, unreliable internet, and discomfort with digital tools can make virtual care hard to access. VITAL VT responds by turning local libraries into telehealth hubs, giving residents a familiar, trusted place to connect with health care providers.
For some families this can mean the difference between delaying care and getting timely support. Consider a parent juggling work and three kids, living 45 minutes away from the nearest clinic. A telehealth visit from a local library can mean timely care and fewer missed days of work or school, and provide peace of mind.
It is not just about technology; it’s about meeting people where they are and supporting them in ways that make sense for their lives. 
What makes projects like VITAL VT powerful is the partnership they create between communities, health care providers and students. University of Vermont students gain hands-on experience while helping their neighbors and libraries become central players in local health care efforts.
These efforts also strengthen the regional workforce pipeline: students are exposed to rural practice environments and gain practical experience in community-centered care, while counties benefit from the fresh energy and innovative ideas that student teams bring. This model not only improves access today but encourages the next generation of health care professionals to consider careers in rural Vermont. 
Another example of Vermont’s innovative approach to rural health care is our mobile obstetric simulation program (supported by a UVM health safety and value grant, and a UVM Frymoyer grant). With the recent trend of obstetric units closing in rural areas, more emergency departments are finding themselves on the front line of maternity care, managing labor and delivery scenarios traditionally considered outside their usual scope.
This shift leaves providers with fewer opportunities to practice complex deliveries and neonatal emergencies in a controlled setting. By bringing high-fidelity simulations directly to community emergency departments, clinical teams can rehearse rare but critical scenarios, building confidence and readiness for moments when every second counts.
These trainings have already reached more than 100 health care professionals across the state, helping teams manage emergencies such as preterm births and postpartum hemorrhage. Programs like this demonstrate how Vermont’s health care system can respond creatively to gaps in access while strengthening local teams and improving patient outcomes.
National Rural Health Day doesn’t just remind us that rural health care challenges are part of everyday life here in Vermont, it highlights the new approaches that become possible when communities, providers, and students work together. From telehealth in local libraries, to hands-on obstetric simulations, Vermont’s small towns are full of innovation, collaboration and resilience.
By investing in community-centered programs and supporting local health care infrastructure, we can strengthen health care access for every Vermonter, regardless of geography. Every local initiative, every community partnership, and every effort to connect patients with care is a step toward a rural health care system that works for everyone.

The genuine beauty of dreams
Maelyn Slavik, 15, Burlington
Our world is filled with such
delicate things, such
beautiful little lights we
find glittering in our eyes and
try to tuck
into pages of torn-out notebook paper that we
fold into our pockets and the creases
of our palms.
There’s a boy in my grade who
plays the piano so beautifully, whose
fingers dance across the keys, and
you can tell each careful note flows
with the dreams of his heart and as
a labor of love, one
that flows so smoothly, even though
he probably stumbled at first.
It doesn’t sound like it, though, as
he plays a song, so sweetly, for
a group of girls to dance to, the
sparkling wings of their act fanned out
around their shoulders, slow and
graceful and
absolutely beautiful.
In our show is another boy, an
actor and singer whose accent
makes his words all the prettier, and
who once told us all to thank
one another
for the kindness that lingers
all around us; he
smiles so genuinely, and
you can see his dreams as they shimmer
all around him.
Those dreams (of
the piano and the firefly wings, and
of the boy who carries stars
everywhere he goes)
are ones I’ll fold over and over and
over into tissue paper whose creases
mirror the ones on my palms.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-30 12:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Could demise of special projects bill make it harder for Speaker White to pass school choice?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/30/speaker-white-special-projects-school-choice/,Legislative leaders often hold the hammer of special projects to get votes for their key proposals like school choice. But what happens if there is no hammer?,"At some point during the quickly approaching 2026 session of the Mississippi Legislature, House Speaker Jason White will meet behind closed doors with his two-thirds Republican supermajority and ask those members to vote for some form of school choice legislation to provide public funds to private schools while requiring little to no accountability and oversight.
It is the modus operandi of White to meet on the public’s business, including expending public funds, behind closed doors before taking pivotal issues to the full House for debate and a final public vote.
But in the 2026 legislative session, which begins in early January, White could be meeting behind closed doors without the hammer he has previously possessed.
The leadership of the Legislature has long held the hammer over members’ political heads of the so-called special projects bill that is routinely one of the last items passed at the end of each session. The bill provides funds – often totaling in the hundreds of millions of dollars – to pay for projects back home. 
Members who buck the leadership on key votes run the risk of not having their town’s main street repaved or lights placed on their local baseball field. Such projects are routinely funded via a single line tucked in a bill totaling hundreds of pages where scores of other similar local projects are included. The projects bill is normally closely overseen by House Ways and Means Chairman Trey Lamar, who is one of White’s closest allies.
It is normal to see members, with eyes squinting, perusing the massive bill, looking for their project as the legislation is unveiled during the final hours of the session. 
It is important to understand that for many legislators – especially House members – that special project is more important than phasing out one-third of the state revenue stream as they did with a big tax cut in the 2025 session or sending public funds to private schools with no accountability mechanism as is being proposed in 2026.
But the process of passing the tax cut last year might have changed the dynamic. The fight over reducing the revenue stream over time by one-third was so contentious between the House and Senate that the special projects bill did not pass. It got caught up in the battle.
After arguing all session about the tax cut, which eventually passed in a flawed form, the Senate refused to take up a special projects bill. After such a large cut, Senate leaders said the state could not afford to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on special projects.
So, it is possible, maybe likely, that some House members who opposed the landmark tax cut legislation voted for it, anyway, with the understanding they would get a special project.
They didn’t, though.
Could that occur again in the 2026 session as a result of a heated debate over whether to spend public funds on private schools?
Would the Senate leadership have the gumption to eschew a special projects bill again? After all, senators like special projects, too.
And would rural House members in areas of the state where there are no private schools of any note vote to take public funds that could be going to their local district and send their taxpayers’ money to a private school in some metropolitan area that their students have no way of attending?
This session, those issues might be debated. The initial discussion, though, will be in a closed-door meeting of the two-thirds Republican supermajority of the Mississippi House.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/25172713/House-Education-Freedom-Select-Committee-7.jpg,,,2025-11-30 08:01:23.878575

A new art house movie theater, Partizanfilm, is set to open in Burlington next week, filling the gap left by the closure of the Roxy Cinema last year.
The cinema, on 230 College St., will open to members on Dec. 3, and to the broader public the following day, with food and screenings of two movies from the 1970s, “The Last Picture Show” and “Kings of the Road.”
The movie theater has two intimate auditoriums — with 31 and 19 seats, respectively — and a lobby with a cafe-bookstore.
“I kind of couldn’t imagine living in a place without a movie theater,” said Brett Yates, president of Partizanfilm and one of the nonprofit’s five board members. 
Yates said the Roxy was the only commercial movie theater in Burlington, and when it closed last year, he was hoping someone would open a new movie theater. Once it became evident that no one would, he decided to step in.
“I talked with some friends and with my wife, and we thought, well, maybe we could be the ones who do something about it,” Yates said. 
So the five Burlingtonians started looking for spaces for sale to create the movie theater and bought the current property last May.

Now, after months of renovation and with the help of volunteers and members, the space is ready for the upcoming opening.
The cinema will be open seven days a week and offer a mix of commercial movies, independent and foreign films, and old movies. Movies in the evening cost $12, with cheaper tickets during the day. Members have a $2.50 discount on any ticket.
Some of the first movies on the schedule include “Angel’s Egg,” “Henry Fonda for President,” and “Eternity,” with later screenings featuring titles such as “Marty Supreme,” starring Timothée Chalamet, and “The Secret Agent,” which won the best director and best actor prizes at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival.
“We’re not business people. We’ve never started a nonprofit corporation before,” Yates said. “But I think we’ve been, overall, very fortunate. It has kind of all come together.”

Yates said the board wanted to create a social hub where people could gather and talk about films, not just a movie theater.
His wife, Michelle Sagalchik, who is also a board member, said the plan is for people to get involved in the cooperative project and potentially run to become board members when current board members finish their terms.
“We want Partizanfilm to belong to the community. We want the community to take ownership of it,” Yates said. 
Partizanfilm already has about 390 members, according to Yates.
“We — the founding board — don’t want to run it forever,” he said. “We’re creating a cultural institution that we hope we can pass on to everybody.”

A stray comment from a local dollhouse club has snowballed into nearly every downtown storefront aiming to shrink a challenging economic climate with an inaugural Festival of Miniatures.

BRATTLEBORO — Melany Kahn was hosting a local dollhouse club last spring when she first eyed the 3-foot-tall model Victorian “painted lady” in need of a facelift.
“I didn’t see its warts,” Kahn recalled of torn clapboards and tarnished copper. “I just saw its possibilities.”
As a half-dozen club members repaired and restored the aging micro-manse, a stray comment about displaying it downtown snowballed into something bigger.

“Wouldn’t it be amazing,” Kahn remembered hearing, “if every store had one in its window?’”
Cue the inaugural Festival of Miniatures, set to debut this December with nearly 90 dollhouses, dioramas and toy trains — even a working “Mouse Metro” escalator — on display through a partnership with the Downtown Brattleboro Alliance. 
Local merchants spent much of 2024 battling headlines about business closures, bank consolidations and boosted police presence. Festival organizers, aiming to change the narrative, hope thinking small will pay off big.
“Small is cute and sweet and whimsical and charming — and also accessible and affordable,” Kahn said in an interview. “The idea is not to just stand outside and look, it’s an invitation in.”

That’s why the Shoe Tree now features handknit animals nestled in literal shoebox apartments. Why Morning Glorious Vintage has dolls in retro couture. Why Mitchell Giddings Fine Arts has the newly restored model Victorian filled with 100 locally crafted small-scale furnishings.
“Most artists went above and beyond,” said Kahn, pointing to tiny touches fashioned by area potters, weavers and glassblowers.
The festival, running through December, will officially launch during the town’s first-Friday-of-the-month Gallery Walk. Alongside storefronts, the Brattleboro Museum and Art Center will host toy trains, the Latchis Gallery will feature a “Museum of Things Tiny and Found” and the Boys & Girls Club will offer a Dec. 20 display of “Spirit Houses” decorated by 13 area schools.
Organizers won’t say if the festival will return until they record and review public response.
“There are metrics we can measure,” Kahn said of spectator and sales figures.
There’s also the small stuff not easily seen.
“Shopkeepers are working very, very hard to make our downtown thrive, and that’s what has kept me so invested and involved,” Kahn said. “To me, supporting this feels really good, really important.”
And, amid so many miniatures, really big.

This story by John Lippman was first published in Valley News on Nov. 26, 2025.
A Bradford man faces a potential prison sentence and nearly $500,000 in restitution payments for taking payments for van conversions for which he failed to perform the work.
Matthew Strong ran the now-shuttered business called East Coast Van Builds on Route 5 in Bradford’s Lower Plain. He advertised as a specialist in customized camper vans. He also has worked as a music promoter and is known for organizing reggae events in the state.
Strong has agreed to plead guilty to a charge of wire fraud after admitting that he took van customer payments and diverted some of the money to his entertainment business, according to a plea deal entered in federal court in Burlington on Nov. 18.
Strong required customers to pay an initial $10,000 non-refundable down payment and then 50% toward the remaining balance of their job — typically $30,000 or more — but failed to deliver the work as promised and dodged calls and emails from irate customers inquiring about the status of their vehicles, the court documents said.
East Coast Van Builds operated from 2021 through at least the end of 2024 and specialized in converting Ford Transit and Mercedes vans into customized camper vehicles with kitchen, bathroom and bedding facilities, according to court documents.
Customers said Strong would prevaricate when it became apparent the work had not been done, or ghost them altogether, according to court documents and interviews with customers. An attorney listed in court documents as representing Strong did not respond to an email request for comment on Tuesday. An email to an address listed for Strong also received no response.
A private Facebook group called Survivors of East Coast Van Builds, which was created in March as a place for former customers “to commiserate, share resources, legal advice, ideas, rage, and heal,” now has 37 members.
Many of the accounts shared in the group echo that of Charlie Allen.
Allen, a retired software developer from Wilmington, Delaware, said he and his wife had purchased a new Ford Transit 350 HD van for $65,000 in 2022 which was delivered that May to Strong in Bradford to convert into a camper. The cost of the job would be $120,000, and Allen said he paid half upfront.
Then began the runaround, Allen said.
“I’d call him up and ask what’s going on,” Allen, 71, told the Valley News. “He’d say, ‘Oh, I’m having trouble getting parts’, or ‘So-and-so ‘is sick’. Then the summer wore on and it’s August and he says, ‘A month. You’re third in line’. Then there’d be another month.”
Eventually, Allen became fed up with the excuses and said he drove seven hours from his home in Delaware to Bradford in February 2023 — nine months after Strong took possession of the van — to see for himself what the problem was. What Allen said he found was that only the windows, roof vents and a fan had been installed, only a fraction of the work.
“He’d done zip,” said Allen, who abandoned all hope and drove off with his van.
He said he does not expect to recover the $60,000 he paid to Strong despite the restitution required under his plea agreement. He noted that when he and his wife found another company to complete the conversion, the windows that Strong installed had to be replaced because they leaked.
“We got nothing. All we got was lies,” Allen said.
According to court documents, Strong took photographs of work-in-progress inside one customer’s van and sent them to the customer of another van claiming the images were evidence of work-in-progress on the van the second customer had demanded to see.
In another instance, Strong used money customers paid for van conversions to cover expenses for a music festival he produced in Topsham in 2022, prosecutors said. He used one customer’s van without permission at the Topsham festival, which the customer was able to detect through tracking software.
Strong, through his company Rooted Entertainment Solutions, organized the Green Mountain Reggae Festival at the Bradford Fairgrounds last year and the Green Mountain Smoke Out festivals in Topsham in 2023 and 2024.
Strong was stringing along at least 10 van customers from seven states, the court documents state. He has agreed to forfeit a total of $477,502 in payments, according to the plea agreement.
A court date has not yet been scheduled for Strong to formally enter his guilty plea on a single felony count of wire fraud. A conviction on the charge is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater.
Even customers who were able to get their van conversions completed by Strong said it was an ordeal. Michelle Robbins said she had to literally show up on the day she was told work would be done and wouldn’t leave until it was completed.
“We were actually one of the ‘lucky’ ones. … We did end up getting a build-out but only after showing up at the shop multiple times demanding answers,” Robbins said via text. “We straight up accused (Strong) of felony fraud because he had $60K of our cash and nothing to show for it,” she said. “At that point we gave a firm deadline … We knew there was no money and knew we had to push for a build rather than try to get money back.”
“We let him know it was up to him whether we got the police involved,” Robbins wrote. “Once we accused him of fraud, he magically found time to work on the van and get it almost complete — with many issues because they rushed.”
Getting his van converted into a van was a much rougher ride for Tim Weaver, however. Weaver, of Carrabassett Valley, Maine, said he forked over $60,000 to have Strong convert a van he purchased at the Lebanon Ford dealership in 2023 and contracted with him in April of that year to begin work.
Weaver had very specific instructions about how the van was to be fitted out with special equipment because his wife, Carol Weaver, is an adaptive athlete who is a paralyzed from the chest down as the result of a mountain biking accident three years ago. The couple’s goal was to have a vehicle that could transport Carol Weaver’s $25,000 mountain bike securely while also providing room for Tim Weaver, also a software engineer, to work remotely.
A specially fitted-out camper van, like the one Tim Weaver had seen on YouTube of a paralyzed former Canadian female Olympic athlete using to “drive around Canada,” would be the ideal solution for them. At first Strong seemed enthusiastic about taking on the van conversion project, even contacting the Canadian woman in the YouTube video.
“That to us said all the right things. We jumped right in,” said Tim Weaver, admitting sheepishly, “we didn’t do a lot of due diligence after that.”
So in April 2023, the Weavers signed a contract and sent Strong the initial $10,000 down payment and soon followed that with another $50,000 for “materials cost” [sic]. They also spent $67,000 to buy a Ford Transit Extended High Roof.
“Less than two weeks after I wired the big $50K (to Strong) it was radio silence,” Weaver said. Months passed before Weaver said he could finally get Strong on the phone again. “I was a little upset,” Weaver said.
He recalled telling Strong, “I get you may not be jumping on my van because you got other things going on, but I send you 50 grand and you ignore me? You just take my money?” Weaver said “that was the point we should have bailed. But we had already invested so there was no way out.”
In April 2024, 12 months after they had signed the contract and paid Strong $60,000 Weaver said he delivered the van to Strong’s shop in Bradford. Inquiries about how things were progressing were fruitless. The few times he could get Strong to respond, “he said they ‘started it, we’re working on it’. There was always some weird excuse, like ‘my dad’s house burned down’,” Weaver said.
Although he demanded photographs as proof of progress, Weaver said none were ever sent.
“The van sat with them from April 2024 until we got a call from the Vermont AG’s office saying, ‘You need to come get your van,’ which was April 2025, basically 12 months,” Weaver said.
He traveled from Maine, and when he got there and tried to start the engine, it wouldn’t turn over. A rear brake light was smashed. The only conversion work that had been done was some mounting strips to which interior paneling was to be attached — but was so poorly done it had to be stripped out. “Basically, after two years, all I had was flooring,” Weaver said.
With the help of jumper cables, Weaver got the van to start and he drove it back to the dealership in Lebanon, which in a couple weeks did the necessary repairs. He then brought it to home Maine where Weaver, now retired and with ample time on his hands, embarked on a DIY project to convert the van into a camper himself.
Weaver wrapped up the project a couple months ago, and on Dec. 5, he and Carol are driving the camper to Breckenridge, Colorado, where Carol will participate in the Hartford Ski Spectacular, a week-long program ski and snowboarding adaptive program.
“That will be our first big trip,” Weaver said.

(Photo by Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)  Linda McLain reached the end of her two-year sentence at the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women in July, but it would be another month before she could leave. It took those 30 extra days for her to find a residential facility that met the terms of her supervised release.  
Her wait time is an indication of the state’s shortage of transitional living space, group homes where the recently incarcerated can ease their way back into society. The supervised settings offer reliable shelter while residents seek employment and meet what are often rigorous terms of release, including drug testing and court appearances.   
McLain, 55, was placed at A New Way of Life, a residential reentry center in New Orleans. She was imprisoned in 2023 for a string of drug and property crimes in Jefferson Parish, describing them as poor decisions attributed to a substance addiction. She was sentenced to a diversion program that kept her isolated from the main prison population to focus on her recovery and job-training skills.

But even with that special treatment and an extra month behind bars, McLain acknowledged she was not ready to be out on her own. 
“If you are protecting us so hard and keeping us from the elements in prison, now who’s going to protect me when I get out?” McLain said in an early September interview. 
As of mid-November, she was still living at A New Way of Life and training for a promotion at the restaurant where she works. 
There’s no precise picture of how many formerly incarcerated people require reentry services in Louisiana. Residential reentry programs are supervised at the district court level, so there is no cumulative number available from state corrections officials on how many people live in such settings. 
Incarceration data sheds some light on the need. Louisiana has consistently led the nation in per capita prison population, with more than 1,000 out of every 100,000 residents imprisoned as of 2024 according to the Prison Policy Initiative.
As of Sept. 30, there were nearly 30,000 people in state custody according to the latest numbers from the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections. Almost 45,000 more are under state supervision, with the large majority on probation.
Instead of running its own halfway houses, the state contracts with nonprofit residential reentry service providers, who operate 36 housing sites in 17 parishes. 










The work we do not only improves the quality of life for our clients, but it's improving public safety for the community.


– Andrew Hundley, The Parole Project co-founder


The Parole Project, a Baton Rouge-based organization, is the largest of these nonprofits. It owns 11 properties for people transitioning from prison to residential supervision and another 33 residences for individuals who’ve completed their obligation to the state but still need its structure and support service. These homes, too, have been at maximum capacity all year. 
“I estimate that we’re only able to accommodate half of the people in prisons who reach out to us, asking us for reentry services and housing support when they leave,” said Andrew Hundley, Parole Project co-founder and executive director. 
Hundley was the first “juvenile lifer” in Louisiana to be paroled in 2016 when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled life sentences without parole for child offenders were unconstitutional. He was imprisoned at age 15 for the second-degree murder of 14-year-old Terri Pitre in Acadia Parish in 1997. Hundley’s sentence was commuted to time served when he was 36, and he helped launch the Parole Project within months of his release. 
Initially, he and the other formerly incarcerated individuals in his organization saw themselves as mentors to others who would be freed under the ruling. They would help them open bank accounts, get their drivers’ licenses and teach them to use cellphones, which didn’t exist when many of them were first sentenced.      
“Where we were off the mark was housing because there’s the assumption that people are going to go home to their families,” Hundley said. “That missed on people who’ve been in prison so long they’ve outlived their families … Sometimes you don’t want to go back to the community where you caused harm because you want a place to start fresh.”
Hundley said there are no plans for the Parole Project to expand beyond its Baton Rouge footprint, though its services are available to anyone regardless of where they’re from in Louisiana if they don’t want to go back home after exiting prison. Housing prices are a primary obstacle to adding transitional living space in New Orleans, Hundley said.

There are also no plans on the horizon for the state to put more money into what its corrections department calls emergency and transitional housing, according to Nicole George, coordinator of the state’s Justice Reinvestment Initiative. 
“We’re always interested in improving as [the Division of Parole and Probation] sees the need for us to reevaluate certain things,” George said. 
When it was started in 2015, Louisiana’s Justice Reinvestment Initiative sought to save money on corrections with a focus on placing violent, serious offenders in prison. The resulting prison population drop allowed those resources to be directed toward reentry and other programs to reduce recidivism.     
Former Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, championed the initiative over his two terms in office. His successor, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, has emphasized longer prison sentences for more offenders and fewer opportunities for parole through his first two years in office. His administration has directed significant dollars toward upgrading and building juvenile correctional facilities.    
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The need for transitional living space in New Orleans was evident soon after A New Way of Life cut the ribbon on a two-story house in the Hollygrove neighborhood. It’s been at or near its capacity of 16 residents since first opening its doors in January.
The Los Angeles-based nonprofit has similar sites in 12 states and two African countries for women who have exited prison. Founder Susan Burton came to New Orleans in January for its grand opening. She launched the organization in 1998 after being incarcerated for a total of 20 years for crimes related to her drug addiction.  
Based on Burton’s post-prison experience and needs, A New Way of Life provides much more than shelter. Its staff connects formerly incarcerated women with jobs and logistical assistance to keep them. There’s also mental health support, both formal and informal, including counseling for a number of residents who are recovering from addiction and substance abuse.
“Having places like this benefits all of us,” Jefferson Parish Judge June Berry Darensburg, who oversees its drug court, said in an interview. Defendants who appear before her can be diverted from hard prison time if they are good candidates for in-custody rehabilitation and work skills training. They’re also required to secure a spot in a reentry facility such as A New Way of Life. 
The impact of transitional residential services has caught the attention of state Rep. Debbie Villio, R-Metairie, a former Jefferson Parish prosecutor known for tough-on-crime legislation. She declined an interview but confirmed last month that she’s working with the state corrections department, the Parole Project and other groups on legislation in support of reentry services. 
The state provides up to $20 per day per formerly incarcerated person for six months of transitional housing. This money doesn’t cover the Parole Project’s expenses, Hundley said. He explained the organization doesn’t manage its properties as a money-making operation, with rental rates deliberately kept below market rate for its post-transitional housing to keep those tenants on the path to self-sufficiency. 
Hundley is banking on philanthropy to ensure the Parole Project can continue its mission, noting that any reduction in state funding could force belt-tightening. 
“The work we do not only improves the quality of life for our clients, but it’s improving public safety for the community,” Hundley said.

‘You’re going to have rules’
Structure is part of living at A New Way of Life, a residential home in New Orleans for the formerly incarcerated where the staff ensures residents show up on time for work, court dates, drug screenings, counseling and any other appointments deemed necessary. 
The women who live here are also expected to take part in daily group discussions at 8 a.m.. They’re also responsible for household chores and must adhere to a 10 p.m. curfew.  
“That structure is there to help them understand that everywhere you’re going to go, there’s going to be rules. Even if you’re out on your own and have your own apartment, your own house, you’re going to have rules,” said Dante Butler, the New Orleans home’s director of housing services. “Getting them used to that societal structure is a plus for them, and once they get out there it won’t be such a huge shocker.”
Butler handles most of the residents’ logistics. He’s also an attorney who accompanies some of the women to their court appearances, helping to build a solid reputation for the new reentry home.
Linda McLain is among the 16 residents at the home. She was released from prison in July after serving a two-year sentence for drug and property crimes in Jefferson Parish, where a judge placed her in a diversion program that’s contingent upon her following the rules of A New Way of Life.
Within days of settling in at the group home, McLain started a job on the overnight shift at a nearby 24-hour restaurant. It was the only time slot that didn’t conflict with her daytime court obligations. 
Even with all of the court-ordered and self-imposed restrictions she faces, McLain still keeps an eye toward the future. Her ultimate goal is to start her own business, putting to use the horticultural and pest control certificates she earned while in prison. She wants to employ other formerly incarcerated women who need the same hand up she’s received. 
“I’m 55 years old. I cannot keep going in that same path. Where am I going? Nowhere,” McLain said in an early September interview. “For me, I just want to live the next half of my life successfully.” 
McLain is still coming to terms with how her criminal past led her family to “washing their hands” of her, calling it her lowest moment. She’s not to reunite with those relatives yet.
“They like to remind me that, ‘You know you’re where you’re at because of the mistakes you made,’” McLain said. “I know that I don’t need you constantly reminding me.” 
As of mid-November, McLain was still living at A New Way of Life. Butler said she continues to progress in her recovery and is now being trained in different positions at the restaurant with plans to become a manager.
Trenice Lawson, 50, lived in the group home for six months and found her own place nearby in August that she shares with her son. She was released from prison in 2023 after serving 25 years for attacking a security guard at a hospital while under the influence of drugs. Lawson said it was the culmination of a criminal history driven by her addiction.
“My lifestyle before I went to prison was basically the street life, the drugs, the hustling,” she said. “I shoplifted to support my habit.”
Her first transitional living site after prison didn’t offer the structure Lawson said she needed, and living with her brother in the River Parishes meant she had few opportunities to find work. But after moving into A New Way of Life earlier this year, she landed a full-time job with a tour bus company and picks up shifts with the Superdome event staff during football games. Lawson credits the group home’s nurturing environment with helping her confront trauma from her childhood and begin the healing process.
One of the key components of group home life Lawson and McLain both mentioned is the shared experience and insight of the other women under the same roof,  
“Any given point if, if one of us is having a bad day, we can look at each other and go, ‘What’s going on? Talk to me. Let’s go talk about it,’” McLain said. “And there’s absolutely no judgment going on. We know we’ve been there.

In 2018, Bob Florence tapped out a message on Instagram. Would James Wayman, then head chef of Mystic’s Oyster Club, try the soy sauce that Florence had been brewing in barrels in his basement? 
Florence didn’t know that Wayman was already conducting his own nascent experiments with koji on the second floor of Oyster Club. Koji, a mold that transforms soybeans into soy sauce and rice into miso, has been a tool in Asian cooking for millennia, but Wayman was just beginning to explore how it might be deployed in his kitchen, from fermenting charcuterie to baking bread. 
“Koji has been the single biggest game changer in the food I’ve made over the years,” said Wayman, sitting at a picnic table on a sunny October day outside of his cafe, Nana’s, in Mystic. When koji is used to inoculate beans and grains, it releases sugar from starch and amino acids from protein. Those flavors — of sweetness and umami — linger on the palate. Together they play a chord of flavor, Wayman says, rather than a single note. 
“Some of the most amazing foods in the world don’t do that. An incredible peach is so amazingly delicious, but you eat it, you have the flavor sensation, and it’s gone, right? Koji has the ability to draw that out and make it bounce around all of your taste buds.”

Koji was also the critical ingredient transforming soy beans into the soy sauce in Florence’s basement in Mystic — a slow-motion Maillard reaction, the same chemical process that occurs when proteins and sugars are heated and rendered delicious. Think: the sear on a steak, or the caramel notes in the crust of a baguette. 
When Florence took on soy sauce making, he was moving on from a long career that combined manufacturing with chemistry. Early in his career, he lived in Detroit and sold industrial plastics to the automotive industry, back when manufacturers were replacing clunky metal parts with plastic to lighten vehicles and improve mileage. Later, Florence worked in electronics manufacturing. Both industries brought him frequently to Japan and China, where he became a disciple of local cuisine. 
Florence eventually used his training as a chemist to pivot from plastics to renewable energy, working with a startup that turned algae into oil. The science worked, but the business wasn’t profitable. By then, Florence was living in Mystic with his wife, children’s book author Debbi Michiko Florence. After selling off the equipment to the algae fermentation company, Florence started casting about for a new idea. He embarked on what seemed, at first, to be a hobby: brewing soy sauce at home. 
“If you go to a grocery store in Japan, there might be a selection of like 20 different soy sauces, whereas in America you might have one or two or three,” Florence said. Often made by small family companies, local Japanese soy sauces, or shoyu, were “beautiful” to Florence. They were thick, opaque, umami-rich, and they enhanced food more deeply than the mass produced translucent varieties on U.S. shelves.
“My question was, how are they made? And can they be made here? And can I make them?” 

Patiently, Florence waited. His koji-inoculated soy beans and wheat turned into soy sauce. He worked up the courage to ask Wayman to try it. Immediately, Wayman asked to put it on the menu at Oyster Club — written into the ingredient list as “Bob Florence Soy Sauce.”

“I was sort of tapping the brakes on being commercial. I was just looking for feedback,” Florence said. “But the next thing I know, he put it on the menu.” 
Wayman could immediately tell that someone who cared about food was making the soy sauce. 
“It was almost like an extension of him, in a way. His food felt like Bob,” Wayman recalled. The soy sauce and the human being who created it both possessed “a quietness, a softness almost, but an intensity and intellect.”

But even after that milestone, Florence continued to tinker. He sought advice from experts, sending a letter to 15 CEOs of Japanese soy sauce companies.  
“My letter to them was really simple. It was, ‘Hi, I’m Bob. I make soy sauce in America, and I’m coming to Japan. Would you mind spending a few minutes talking to me about soy sauce?’” 
Three CEO’s responded. “They were kind and gentle,” Florence said. They let him know his soy sauce was “OK.” Good enough to keep going. Of those CEO’s, Kyosuke Iida, president of Chiba Shoyu, became his mentor. 
Florence, his wife Debbi, and Wayman invested in scaling up the business together, a brand they would call Moromi, which refers to the mash of ingredients put in a barrel to brew what will eventually be pressed and become soy sauce. They searched for a space to expand production and, just before the COVID pandemic hit, found a former batting cage in North Stonington, complete with AstroTurf, and transformed it into a soy sauce brewery. Today, Florence says that Moromi is one of just a handful of U.S.-made soy sauce brands.
Debbi, a third-generation Japanese American, has also written children’s books that play on the theme of cooking, like a picture-book biography of Michelin-starred Chef Niki Nakayama. 
Over the years, Wayman has brought his perspective as a chef to the venture, convincing Florence to experiment. Many of these renditions highlight a single additional ingredient, like maitake mushrooms, sugar kelp, or rye, to create new flavor profiles. Florence would be happy, he says, just making a single version of Moromi, but the experiments have played a part in attracting chefs from across the country to bring Moromi to the tables of their restaurants, to more than 200 shops, and even to Connecticut for visits to the Moromi brewery in North Stonington where they sign their names to the “chef’s wall of culinary creativity.”
Wayman is no longer affiliated with Oyster Club, but at his Nana’s locations in Westerly, R.I., and Mystic, Moromi and koji can be found all over the menu. There are miso glazed sourdough donuts, made to order. Pizza sauce with koji (“it makes a tomato taste more tomatoey,” Wayman says). Koji porridge sourdough bread. Even daily specials like a poke bowl highlight Moromi, with a splash of sugar kelp shoyu. 
“It’s easy, if you know how to cook already, to integrate into your food,” Wayman said.

Even ice cream shop Mystic Drawbridge has gotten in on the fun, crafting their Sweet ‘n Salty Shoyu scoop with a touch of vanilla — cooking Moromi with sugar results in a deep, salty caramel that is at once simple and decadent. 
These days, Florence runs the day-to-day of the business. He gets up early, has a cup of coffee around 4:30 a.m., goes over orders and makes shipments. Perhaps he presses a batch of soy sauce, or inoculates a batch of soy beans which sit in a sauna-like room, paneled with cedar planks. Florence has just one assistant on staff, and though Moromi is carried in stores across the U.S., the operation is small enough that they can handle the volume. Moromi isn’t carried by big box stores, which Florence says is a conscious choice in a business that’s defined by patience. 
“It’s like anti-fast. Everything is slow. The fermentation. The pressing,” he said. “There’s nothing rushed.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MOROMI-SOYSAUCE-1001-DE-202-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-30 05:56:11.582771

(Photo by Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)The trouble started one wet Friday morning in late October when Jarom Smith walked past a weathered red gate in a brushy area near the southwest corner of the Emporia city limits. Smith, a citizen journalist, wanted a couple of photos of the old police shooting range inside to post for his readers.
“I simply walked around the gate,” Smith recalls. “I didn’t open anything. I didn’t climb anything. I didn’t have to.”
Smith says he didn’t notice a sign saying the area is for law enforcement only.
We’re standing on the dirt lane outside the open gate, two days before Thanksgiving. As we speak, Smith is being investigated for criminal trespass and authorities have obtained a search warrant for the Facebook account of his digital newspaper, the Lyon County Observer. It seeks “all records” from three days in October.
There are no officers inside practicing, no sharp reports cracking the November air, just a few city workers. They appear to be moving dirt or preparing to. There’s a bulldozer idling on the shoulder of the road behind us. We’re a few hundred yards away from the city transfer station, which before the days of recycling and waste management would be called the city dump.
There’s a “Dead End” sign near the red gate to the shooting range, but the warning sign is behind us and to one side of a low-water bridge maybe 25 yards away. I don’t spot it myself until Smith points a finger at it.
Suddenly the bulldozer comes roaring up behind us and passes close as it goes through the gate. A few minutes later, the transfer station supervisor comes up in a white city truck. The supervisor, a guy named Tim in a dark ball cap and a safety-green shirt, is visibly irritated.
He says the area is posted. I say we’re on public property.
“We’ve already run this guy off twice,” the supervisor says, indicating Smith with a tilt of his head.
Then he steps on the gas and briskly enters the off-limits area.
On Oct. 24, Smith posted the images of the range to the Observer’s Facebook account and then forgot about them. He was surprised when he got a phone call from an investigator with the Emporia Police Department a couple of weeks later saying he was investigating a criminal trespass complaint at the joint city-county shooting range.
“He asked me if I had stepped onto it,” Smith recalls. “I told him I took two photographs and left, and that I didn’t notice any ‘No Trespassing’ sign. He said there was.”
On Nov. 16, he was notified by Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, that the company had received a search warrant for the Observer’s account. When Smith said he didn’t know what the warrant could be about, Meta sent him a copy of the warrant. On its “Information for Law Enforcement” page, the company says it may be compelled, upon receipt of a warrant showing probable cause, to disclose “the stored contents of any account, which may include messages, photos, videos, timeline posts, and location information.” While friends and family chats are now end-to-end encrypted, according to Meta, Smith said he doesn’t believe the same protection applies to business chats.
Signed Nov. 14 by a Lyon County judge, the warrant did not identify the crime being investigated, but it said evidence had been given under oath to find probable cause that an offense had been committed. The warrant sought “all records” for the account from Oct. 23 to Oct. 25.
Meta said Smith had 10 days in which to challenge the warrant or it would release the information. Smith didn’t know what to do. He was afraid he might go to jail through an honest mistake, and he worried about the hundreds of readers who had sent him news tips and other confidential information through the Observer’s account. How could he protect his sources if the police had access to all that information?
It might, Smith feared, be the end of the Observer, a digital upstart on a shoestring budget.
Smith, 41, posts nearly every day. He covers government meetings, publishes crime reports and runs interviews with candidates for local elections. He lives in Olpe, about 14 miles south of Emporia. The Observer has 5,000 followers, and Smith gives them the news with a twist. He’s not afraid to voice his opinion, and that has made him a polarizing figure in this struggling college town of 24,000.
“I really want to see Emporia become a bigger town,” he said, “a stronger town and a more free town. And everything I’m doing is towards that goal.”
Smith defines “more free” as being more transparent, and he believes spending millions on a new shooting range and emergency dispatch center are symptoms of government obfuscation. In one post, he accused a county official of lying about the true cost of the project.
“I don’t think I’m going to stop it from being built,” Smith said, “but it’s time that people speak out and not be afraid.”
It’s a troubling thing for democracy when any news outlet receives a search warrant, and alarming when the warrant is a clear abuse of power. In 2023, the Marion County Record made international news when its newsroom, and the home of its publisher, were targets of a police raid looking for evidence of a nonexistent crime. Authorities improperly seized computers, cellphones, and records. The stress of the raid may have contributed to the death of 98-year-old Joan Meyer, co-owner of the newspaper. The Marion raid, the most brazen example of a challenge to press freedom in recent American memory, has resulted in lawsuits being settled with the paper’s management, its reporters and others in the millions of dollars.
Reporters exercising their First Amendment right to gather news are supposed to be protected by an array of state and federal laws.
“The federal Privacy Protection Act of 1980 sharply limits whether law enforcement can use search warrants against journalists,” David Greene, a senior staff attorney and civil liberties director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told me. “The search warrant (in the Lyon County Observer) case would seem to be so overly broad that it would violate the PPA.”
Greene’s foundation is a San Francisco nonprofit devoted to protecting digital privacy, defending free speech, and promoting internet civil liberties. He said he didn’t think the Kansas Reporter’s Shield Law applied in this case, because the warrant sought material from Meta and not the journalist. While subpoenas for information are fairly common, Greene said, search warrants are less so.
“What the Privacy Protection Act is really saying is use a subpoena,” he said.
A subpoena allows a challenge before authorities can seize documents and equipment. There are exceptions, of course, such as when national security is at risk or a person’s life is in danger. It also does not give journalists carte blanche to commit crimes, although it is unlikely that mistakenly setting foot on a prohibited property would be worth more than a warning in most jurisdictions.
Greene pointed out that the act actually doesn’t identify “journalists” in its language but instead defines the protected material as that gathered with the intent to disseminate to the public.
“Everyone who has social media or uses online services (to reach the public) is covered,” Greene said. “So that doesn’t require someone to be a professional journalist.”
Smith said he considers himself a journalist, although many in the community don’t. Reporters from some legacy media outlets will move across the room to be away from him when he covers meetings. Some officials have taken issue with the accuracy of his reporting, and Smith acknowledges that he is still learning but tries to correct any mistakes quickly.
Smith is a largely self-taught journalist. He graduated from Emporia State University with a BA in political science in 2018, but makes his living as a contractor painting homes and businesses. He spends 10 to 15 hours a week gathering news, maintaining the Facebook account and updating the Observer’s dedicated platform called ShareThere. He says the Observer doesn’t yet make any money, and that his income from the contracting business subsidizes the digital publishing venture. He doesn’t have a fancy camera, so he relies on his phone for just about everything, and he often excuses himself to take a call. It’s important, he said, that he answers when the phone buzzes.
Hundreds of people have contacted him through the Observer’s Facebook account with confidential news tips and other information. In the past 90 days alone, he said, after checking his phone, he’s had 141 conversations with readers.
“Sometimes it’s just people saying hey, I like what you wrote,” Smith said. “Sometimes it’s somebody saying, ‘I’ve got a story for you.’ In the past couple of days I’ve had people who want to meet with me. I don’t write about every story that people ask me to, but I guess I’ve become known to cover things that others don’t.”
He files Kansas Open Records Act requests, attends lots of meetings, and asks many questions. Name an entity in Lyon County — the city commission, county officials, the local hospital — and they have likely been stung by Smith’s opinion. Local officials often find him irksome, some told me confidentially, but others said they had a growing respect for his plainspoken tenacity. His pieces aren’t as polished as those of veteran reporters, but he is building a dedicated audience through aggressive reporting and sharp point of view.
“Emporia’s economy has taken hit after hit — Tyson gone, Holiday Resort closed, Morgan Advanced Materials shuttered — yet the Regional Development Association continues drifting without leadership, purpose, or result,” he wrote in one recent post.
In another:
“On Tuesday, three new (city) commissioners were elected, backed by the same circle of old-money power brokers that have steered this town for decades.”
And, back in April 2025, this commentary about the county’s purchase of land to build a new law enforcement shooting range and 911 communications center at a cost of $2 million:
“For what purpose was this tract of land bought?” Smith asked. “A shooting range. Not a public one for you and me, but for the sheriff’s department. Never mind the fact that they already have one about 300 yards away from the new site. Never mind the fact that there is an additional one a few miles north of town off of the turnpike.”
The price of the project, according to local reports, has now risen to more than $5 million. At least $1 million — including a $250,000 federal grant — has already been approved for the gun range. I emailed Lyon County Commission Chair Ken Duft for comment on the project and Smith’s criticism. Duft did not respond to the request.
While I seldom agree with Smith because our politics are so different — until recently he called the Observer the Lyon County Conservative — I find him an easy man to talk to, somebody who appears sincere in his beliefs. When he sits for an interview, he is freshly showered and wearing clean clothes but still has paint — a dark, institutional brown — from the day’s contracting job clinging to his hands.
When some readers complained that he called out others for misbehavior but was ignoring his own past, he posted his own mugshot from years ago, when he was booked for a misdemeanor. Smith said the offense was later expunged. In 2020 and 2024, he ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for county commissioner, coming in third both times.
Like others with connections to legacy media, I was irritated at how Smith began his digital newspaper. It’s not the way I would have done it, I tsk-tsked to myself. But now I realize that is the point of the Observer, because it’s a publication made not for me but for a different audience. It’s an alternative. And anybody who says he’s not gaining needed journalism skills isn’t paying attention.
But the quality of Smith’s reporting is not a factor when it comes to the search warrant. What does matter is the chilling effect on free speech that occurs when investigators seek warrants to access the social media accounts of those who inform the public.
That Smith was the target of a search warrant from officials who should have known better, especially since the Marion raid, is inexcusable. A literal misstep should not be subject to the full force of investigative discovery. What did investigators hope to gain from the Observer’s social media account? Smith had already shared with them the photos he took and admitted to straying into an area where he didn’t have permission. And the county prosecutor, according to Smith, said she hadn’t even seen the search warrant until it was posted on the Observer’s Facebook account.
Since Nov. 25, Smith has been represented by Max Kautsch, a Lawrence attorney specializing in media law who has also contributed columns to Kansas Reflector. Kautsch declined comment. Smith, however, told me a second, narrower search warrant was in the works for the Observer’s account.
I contacted the county prosecutor, Amy Aranda, and asked her about the case. What crime was being investigated? What local code or state statute did investigators suspect of being broken? What did the second search warrant hope to uncover?
“I cannot comment on an ongoing criminal investigation,” Aranda told me in an email, “except to state it is my understanding that a search warrant was withdrawn, no records were produced, and a second search warrant will not be served relating to the matter you’re inquiring about.”
When I described the email to Greene, the Electronic Frontier Foundation lawyer, he chuckled.
“Well good for them,” he said. “They did the right thing.”

If you’re one of the 82 million Americans who traveled at least 50 miles for Thanksgiving, perhaps some of you opted for Amtrak instead of driving. Our nation’s passenger railroad estimates a 6% boost in ridership this year, as Amtrak’s growth and popularity continues.


Not that taking the train is cheap: A one-way, last-minute fare from Stamford to Washington, D.C. on Thanksgiving day was as much as $400 on one train! It’s a matter of demand exceeding supply. Still, Amtrak is proud of these fares which, nationwide have seen the railroad increase overall revenues by 10%.
Aside from worsening highway traffic and delays, why chose the train instead of driving? Because the investment in its infrastructure is finally paying off with better service.
Stations are being improved, crucial bridges (like the Walk Bridge in South Norwalk) are being reconstructed, new tunnels are being built, tracks and overhead power lines replaced. You can see the improvements as you travel.
And then there’s the new equipment.
Amtrak’s long expected (and four years delayed) NextGen Acela is turning eyes as it whooshes up and down the corridor. It’s a really sweet train, with only five sets in service so far but with 23 more sets to come by 2027. But these sleek new trains are having problems, especially between New Haven and Providence, one of the ‘curviest’ parts of the Northeast.
Fast trains abhor curves. While the new Acela can go as fast as 160 mph, it can do so only on about 40 super-straight miles of its 450-mile journey from Washington to Boston. In the rest of Connecticut it can go no faster than Metro-North.
In fact, the new Acela is slower than the old Acela, especially from New Haven to Providence. The reason? Tilting, or lack thereof.
To handle all the curves in Connecticut, Acela is designed to automatically tilt into the curves, maintaining speed without having passengers’ beverages sliding off their tray-tables into their laps.
But because the NextGen Acela is still awaiting final certification by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), it’s limited in how much it can tilt into curves. That means that, between Providence and New Haven, the new Acela takes ten minutes longer than the older models, worsening those supposedly-faster trains’ on-time performance.
Because our tracks in Connecticut are older and placed closer to together than in other parts of the corridor, the tight clearances between passing trains could cause a problem… especially if two passing trains should both be tilting in the wrong direction and sideswipe each other.
As the NextGen Acelas prove their reliability and improvements are made to our tracks, it’s expected that the Federal Railroad Administration will lift some restrictions and all the new trains will ultimately operate at maximum efficiency.
With more and faster trains, the increase in available seats may lead to lower fares. But what Amtrak really needs is competition… the topic for another story.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NexGen-Acela-3-AMTRAK.jpg,,,2025-11-30 04:56:39.813851

Sarah Beckstrom, who had graduated from the school just two years prior.
“Sarah was the kind of student teachers hoped for,” said Webster County High School Principal Gabriel Markle, who taught Beckstrom when she was a student. “She carried herself with quiet strength, a contagious smile and a positive energy that lifted people around her.” 
Beckstrom, 20, died on Nov. 27 after a targeted attack in Washington, D.C., where she was serving with the National Guard. 
“Her commitment to service, both in our school and in our nation’s military, spoke volumes about her character,” Markle said.

Webster Springs is a small town, and dozens of people in attendance Saturday evening knew Beckstrom or her family members. 
They described Beckstrom as a peacekeeper, someone who was quick to help and who often stepped up to serve. She had dreams of becoming an FBI agent, prompting her to join the National Guard. She was part of a Military Police company.
“It’s a terrible thing that happened, but I’m glad that she was the person that’s in the spotlight and is representing not only West Virginia, but our county,” said Amy Jones, 25, who knows Beckstrom’s family. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey attended the candlelight vigil, telling the crowd that justice would be served in Beckstrom’s death. 
“She loved her state, she loved her country, and she wanted to serve,” the governor said. “It’s hard to sit here and not be angry at what happened to Sarah.”
The suspected gunman, 29-year-old Afghan refugee Rahmanullah Lakanwal, will face a first-degree murder charge along with other charges after shooting two National Guard members, including Beckstrom.
The other victim, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains hospitalized in critical condition. Wolfe is also from West Virginia.

The Webster Springs community held three vigils for Beckstrom following her death.
“The loss of Sarah Beckstrom in such a tragic and senseless manner has been devastating for all that knew her and loved her,” said Sen. Robbie Morris, R-Randolph. “The grief is palpable everywhere you go. The vigils have been filled with tears and broken hearts. My prayers continue to go out to her family, friends and fellow Guardsmen.”
On Saturday evening, the crowd prayed and sang the hymn, “Amazing Grace,” before lighting candles. Many in attendance wore blue ribbons to honor Beckstrom; wreaths in the same shade of blue hung around town in the miles winding to the high school. 
The high school’s Junior ROTC members presented the colors. 
“I feel like it was a worthy homage to her, and it’s good knowing that you know we have the resolve to get through this as West Virginians, as a whole state, rather than a single county,” said Junior ROTC member Liam Versmessen, 17, who attended high school with Beckstrom. 
Funeral details for Beckstrom haven’t been released. 
Morrisey said that Wolfe and Beckstrom were friends while serving in the Guard. The pair were patrolling near a Metro station blocks from the White House at the time of the shooting.
“We pray to lift up Andrew, who is continuing to fight,” Morrisey said. 
Morrisey originally sent about 300 members of the state’s National Guard to D.C. in August, at the request of the Trump administration for “Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful.”
About 150 members of the West Virginia National Guard are still in D.C., and have been deployed there on a voluntary basis since about Nov. 15.
In the wake of the attack on the National Guard members, President Donald Trump announced he intends to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries,” though he didn’t specify which countries would be included.
