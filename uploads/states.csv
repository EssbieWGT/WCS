Spencer Cox’s State of the State speech this year had hints of state policy, while again focusing on building. But now, what needs to be built the most, Cox emphasized, is “moral infrastructure.” 
In an almost 30-minute speech to members of the state Senate and House Thursday evening, Cox called for “a return to virtue,” which, he said, may mean “a return to Utah.”
In today’s Utah, that may take shape by solving challenges, like nearly half of the state’s third graders not being able to read at their grade level. Also, housing affordability struggles, and the growth of homelessness and addiction to both drugs and social media.

Utah may be “perhaps the greatest success story of the American experiment,” Cox said, ranking high on “best of” lists. “And yet, dark clouds are building all around us,” he said, describing a growing sense of loneliness and isolation, especially among young people, despite endless tools to digitally connect.  
2026 priorities 
The governor has a notable animosity against social media companies. So much so that last month he told a room full of tech executives “however much you hate social media, you do not hate it enough,” and, during his tenure, the state has sued social media companies for their “addictive” features.
This year, Cox has unveiled one bill that seeks to fix what he called a mistake the Legislature made last year — to not extend a school cellphone ban throughout the whole school day rather than just class time. 
“Phone-based childhoods are reshaping attention, sleep, relationships, and mental health — not because parents don’t care, but because this is a problem that no single family can solve alone,” he said.
Calling tech companies “the most powerful in human history,” he added he believes the role of government includes establishing “commonsense guardrails.”
“What social media companies do, without a doubt, is tyranny over the minds of our children and grandchildren,” Cox said. “And, well, us adults too.”

However, other tangible issues may also be affecting Utahns’ morale. 
“Too many Utahns are doing everything right,” but are left to wonder if they’ll be able to afford a place of their own, Cox said. 
“This weakens trust and frays the bonds that hold us together.”
He promised that Utah will not become a state of renters, calling leaders to pull every lever to increase housing supply, including zoning reforms, streamline permitting, and more support for infrastructure and innovation. 
But, still, he made a case for small government, saying building more homes “means less government, not more.”
“We will never solve all of our challenges with more laws. This great experiment in self government demands, well, more self government,” Cox said in his speech to Utah lawmakers who this week convened for a 45-day general session, where they are expected to discuss and approve hundreds of bills.
Cox also made a big mention of homelessness, an issue he has vowed to work to solve, and that has made headlines in the state with the announcement of the site of a 1300-bed homeless campus on the west side of Salt Lake City. 
He vowed to make Utah “the worst place in the country to camp on the street, and the best place to get help.” 
Saying that homelessness is growing across the nation, “driven by addiction, mental illness, and the devastating spread of fentanyl,” he committed to help break addiction and crime cycles.
“Real compassion doesn’t leave people trapped. It tells the truth and it restores agency,” he said. “Accountability is not cruelty, it is respect for human dignity.”
‘It has to mean more than words’
“Utah prides itself on being a family state. That has to mean more than words. It means showing up for families in real ways and building a future where they don’t just get by, but truly succeed,” Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla said in legislative Democrats’ response to the State of the State address alongside House Minority Leader Angela Romero. 



Let us know what you think...


 


Both Salt Lake City Democrats committed to fight to advance bills to protect access to food and health care amid federal cuts. Also, to advocate for gun safety laws, protections for the Great Salt Lake, and investments in public education in the state, in addition to other hot topics expected to be studied this session like changes to the judiciary and citizen initiatives.
“At its core, representation is about trust. When people feel seen and respected by their government, our democracy works better,” Romero said. “We are committed to building a Utah where every person knows they belong and has a voice in shaping our shared future.
But no one’s like Utah
During his speech, the Republican governor also took a moment to criticize the country’s two major political parties, saying national elected officials are “making a mockery of Franklin’s virtues, rewarding grift, rejecting decency, and wantonly tearing down the very institutions that made us the envy of every nation.”
Outrage is rewarded and attention is captured by what is loud or divisive, Cox said. And the economy is increasingly profiting from keeping people “scrolling, gambling, borrowing and consuming at the expense of their health, their families and their future.”
But, he said, no other state in the nation reflects virtue more than Utah.
“We still believe in those old fashioned concepts of order, temperance, justice, frugality, industry, humility, sincerity, and yes, even moderation,” he said. “Of course, we have flaws, and we too sometimes drift from those virtues, but I’m grateful to be surrounded tonight by people who love their enemies, still believe in our better angels and try a little harder to be a little better every day.”

,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-23 03:42:14+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Healey comes out swinging against Trump in election-year address,Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/government/state-government/healey-comes-out-swinging-against-trump-in-election-year-address/,"Gov. Maura Healey’s final State of the Commonwealth before she’s up for reelection featured plenty of criticism of the Trump administration, plus hints of modest new action to rein in costs of living.","A YEAR AGO, when Donald Trump was on the verge of returning to the White House for a second term, the president was barely a shadow in Gov. Maura Healey’s annual address. She never said the name “Trump,” and the only mention of a US president was a passing reference to John F. Kennedy’s 1961 speech in the same room where she stood.
Not so much any more.
Healey on Thursday did not hesitate to bash Trump in her latest State of the Commonwealth speech. Life here is too expensive, she said, and the president is “making it worse.” Healey said Trump “throws tantrums like a two-year-old,” and she slammed the aggressive Immigration and Customs Enforcement campaigns unfolding across the country as failing to make America safer.
“In this moment, my job as governor is to provide what the federal government isn’t: stability, security, and how about a little common sense?” she said, looking out over the assembled crowd of deputies, lawmakers, labor leaders, and other guests who filled the House chamber.
Two big things have changed to fuel Healey’s more assertive, prosecutorial tone this time around. Massachusetts has now experienced a full year of impacts from Trump 2.0, from massive federal funding cuts to food aid delays to business-spooking tariffs. It’s also an election year for Healey, who is hoping to secure another term in large part by contrasting herself with a president who remains deeply unpopular with Massachusetts Democrats and independents.
The governor and Legislature will have an array of challenges to navigate in 2026. Changes in Washington are punching holes in the state’s budget, and job growth remains relatively flat.
“It’s true we’re facing real headwinds,” Healey said about the economy. “There’s certain things we know are beyond our control. We can’t control inflation. But there are things we can control, and I also want to say this: We have assets that any other state would trade for in a heartbeat.”
Healey dedicated much of her speech to now-repetitive themes of making Massachusetts more affordable and attractive families and businesses, with most of her newest ideas representing modest changes that could nibble at the edges of the affordability debate while the Legislature takes its time weighing bigger proposals.
Healey acknowledged the state’s sky-high housing costs, which polls show is a top concern of voters, but she offered few new initiatives of note. She said the administration will deploy $25 million to help 1,000 middle-income households with down payment assistance, and would put more funding toward lowering mortgage rates for first-time homebuyers through MassHousing.
The governor also pointed to fairly small-bore recent moves, like a 2024 law that makes it easier to build accessory dwelling units and a budget rider that limited landlords from passing broker fees on to renters.
When it comes the state’s high health care costs, her mention of a policy rolled out last week to cut down on prior authorization — a practice in which health insurers require pre-approval before greenlighting certain types of care or medications — drew one of the loudest applause breaks of the night. (Two even bigger cheers came when Healey recognized a pair of local celebrities: Phil Eng, the decidedly unflashy general manager of the MBTA whose steady efforts to get the beleaguered transit agency back on track have given him surprising star power, and Dropkick Murphys frontman Ken Casey, who was seated in the gallery next to Joanna Lydgate, the governor’s partner.)
Healey also signaled she will file regulations that would ban medical debt from being reported to credit agencies.
“It’s bad enough to get a huge bill when you’re dealing with an illness,” she said. “It shouldn’t wreck your credit, too.”
On another front, Healey — speaking as “someone who’s got two kids at home” — said she will file legislation in the coming weeks to impose stricter age protections on social media companies.
The forthcoming bill will largely mirror legislation Attorney General Andrea Campbell proposed last year, according to Healey’s office. Campbell also sued Meta, the giant behind Facebook and Instagram, a case that emerged before the state’s highest court last month.
“These platforms are built with addictive algorithms. They exploit our insecurities, especially our young people,” Healey said, adding that her legislation would require “parental consent [and] age verification for all of these platforms.”
Healey offered an affordability-themed appetizer to her speech Thursday morning. Hours before she ascended the rostrum, she announced a new plan to provide a bit of relief on high utility bills this winter.
The state will redirect $180 million in payments from utilities, which otherwise would have gone toward clean energy and energy efficiency programs, toward taking 15 percent off residential electric bills in February and March.
Electric utilities also plan to postpone about 10 percent of bill costs from the winter months, and instead collect that from ratepayers between April and December. All gas utilities except will do the same, with plans to collect the deferred 10 percent from May through October.
The relief is essentially a short-term fix while Healey waits for her counterparts in the Legislature to get around to her pitch for longer-term solutions.
Back in May, more than half a year before the coldest months and another round of spiking bills were set to arrive, Healey filed legislation with a suite of reforms she said would save ratepayers $10 billion over a decade.
But the Legislature, as it is wont to do, has shown little urgency getting to the topic. Lawmakers hosted a public hearing in June to learn more about the governor’s ideas. Five months later, top representatives began moving a redraft of the bill that added in controversial language to defang the state’s 2030 decarbonization goals; when those changes ran into a buzzsaw of opposition, House leaders retreated.
Representatives met behind closed doors this week to discuss a path forward for Healey’s bill, after which top Democrats questioned just how much power the state even has to rein in utility bills amid federal opposition to clean energy sources, according to State House News Service.
The State of the Commonwealth address came two days after Healey made official her reelection campaign in a video that — not unlike her speech — accused Trump of “making everything worse” and put lowering costs as a central pledge.
Expect to hear that message plenty more in the next 10 months.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01-22_Healey_SOTC_1-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-22 22:56:44.010802

Chris Wilson, R-Logan, speaks during a media availability with senate leadership at the Capitol in Salt Lake City on the first day of the legislative session, Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)While Utah judicial leaders have been telling lawmakers the district courts have the greatest need for additional funding in order to address heavy workloads, legislators advanced a bill Thursday that would give roughly $1.5 million to those lower courts — but would also use more than $3 million to expand the Utah Supreme Court from five to seven justices. 
The Senate Judiciary, Law Enforcement, and Criminal Justice Committee voted to favorably recommend SB134 to the full Senate after changing it to call for more money for three additional district court judges in Salt Lake County, Utah County and Washington County. 
The bill — if fully funded during a separate budgeting process — would only partially answer the court system’s budget requests, which includes eight district court judges to help address the state’s overwhelmed lower courts. 
Saying it’s not court packing, governor supports expanding Utah’s appeals courts  

Meanwhile, lawmakers are pressing forward with a priority of the state’s three most powerful Republican leaders, Senate President Stuart Adams, House Speaker Mike Schultz, and Gov. Spencer Cox, to add two more seats to the state’s highest court, which is not something the judiciary has said the courts need. 
SB134, sponsored by Senate Minority Whip Chris Wilson, R-Logan, would also expand the Court of Appeals from seven judges to nine, which is a budget priority for the judiciary.
The governor and Republican legislative leaders have said the bill isn’t aimed at “court packing” or changing the makeup of the state’s highest court to appoint justices that make decisions more in the Republican-controlled Legislature’s favor. They argue it’s to better align Utah with other similarly-populated states that have seven justices. 




State populations and supreme court sizes
Utah: 3.6 million, five justices
Wyoming: Less than 600,000, five justices
Montana: 1.1 million, seven justices
Idaho: 2 million, five justices
New Mexico: 2.1 million, five justices
Iowa: 2.38 million, seven justices
Kansas: 3 million, seven justices
Arkansas: 3.1 million, seven justices
Nevada: 3.3 million, seven justices
Connecticut: 3.7 million, seven justices
Colorado: 6 million, seven justices
Arizona: 7.8 million, seven justices




But critics, including Democrats and some legal professionals, argued that the timing and optics of the Utah Supreme Court expansion is concerning. It comes after the Republican-controlled Legislature has clashed with the courts over several rulings, especially in the state’s redistricting lawsuit which recently led to a court-ordered map that included one Democratic district and three heavily GOP districts. 
“The timing here is very suspicious,” said law professor Teneille Brown, who likened the situation to a children’s soccer game. “If you’re worried that your kid is losing and you decide to bring in some refs who are calling fouls (on moves) that you don’t like, when you then win it doesn’t make that victory legitimate, it makes a mockery of the game. This SB134 is no different. Packing the courts for political reasons is wrong, no matter which side is engaging in it.” 
In a media availability earlier Thursday, Adams and Wilson told reporters the proposed Utah Supreme Court expansion isn’t political. Wilson said the two new justices will go through the same appointment process as the existing five.
“Gov. Cox will pick and we’ll confirm, the same way we’ve done with all the other justices,” Wilson said. 
Requests from the judiciary 
A representative for the judiciary — which rarely weighs in on legislation — didn’t comment on the bill during Thursday’s committee hearing. 
However, in his State of the Judiciary speech on Tuesday, Chief Justice Matthew Durrant highlighted key budget requests for the judiciary, including $6 million in ongoing funds to train and retain courthouse staff, and more money to fund eight district court judges, one juvenile court judge, four commissioners, and at least one if not two Court of Appeals judges. 
In order to make room for two more Supreme Court justices, it would cost the state about $1.7 million in one-time money to build new chambers and modify courtroom technology, according to the bill’s fiscal note. The two additional justices would also cost more than $1.4 million in ongoing money for their salary and benefits (which would cost $793,800 for both), along with four law clerks ($557,400) and a judicial assistant ($86,200), plus operational expenses ($35,000). 
Utah Legislature kicks off 1st day of 2026 session with calls to focus on people, cost of living

Wilson’s bill also calls for $1.3 million in ongoing funding for the Court of Appeals for the salary and benefits for two new justices ($761,000 for both), and four law clerks ($557,400). 
The changes to the bill to add three more district court judges in Salt Lake City, St. George and Provo would cost more money — by roughly $1.5 million, or $500,000 per judge including salary, benefits, retirement and staff, the committee’s chair, Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross, said. 
Adams, Schultz and Cox have been publicly saying they want to expand Utah’s Supreme Court for months now — but the changes to Wilson’s bill came after Durrant told lawmakers in his speech on Tuesday that the need for more judges in the lower courts is “much greater” than it is in the Utah Supreme Court.
“Today, our district courts operate in triage mode. We need your help to fix that,” Durrant said. “Each of our (budget) requests is grounded in measured, fact-based workload data. Historically, we have received funding for less than one judicial position per year. Although we appreciate any funding previously provided, at that historical rate it would take 20 years to fill the current need for judicial officers in Utah.”
Durrant also urged lawmakers to “weigh the facts and understand the data you’ve been provided, just as we have in developing our requests.” If the Legislature wants to expand the state’s highest court, “that, of course, is your prerogative,” he said.
The chief justice asked that “if you elect to fund two new justices, please do not do it at the expense of the judicial positions we have prioritized.”

“We heard from (Durrant) in his remarks about the need for lower court judges,” Adams said. “And we’re listening.” 
But at the same time, Republican legislative leaders aren’t budging on their plans to expand the Utah Supreme Court. 
Asked earlier Thursday how lawmakers will prioritize the courts in the budget — which is expected to be tight this year given GOP leaders’ appetite for another income tax rate cut, on top of the $300 million already lost due to federal tax changes — Senate Budget Chair Jerry Stevenson, R-Layton, told reporters: “There are certain things we do here we can make happen.” 
“I really believe that we’ll be able to find (money) to fix the courts,” Stevenson said. 
Stevenson acknowledged that in recent years, lawmakers have “had a lot of requests” for the courts. “Some of them we’ve been really, if I can use this word, a little stingy with.” But he added “I think it’s time” to invest more funding in the courts.
“This is an honorable attempt to try and get systemwide resources (for the courts),” Wilson said during Thursday’s committee hearing. “I think it’s time … to bring our state Supreme Court up to the same level as other states that are the same size.”
Debate 
While many who spoke against SB134 said they liked “two-thirds” of the bill because of the additional judges for the Court of Appeals and the district courts, they urged lawmakers to listen to recommendations from the judiciary itself, which hasn’t asked to expand the Utah Supreme Court. 
A retired 2nd District judge, David Connors, said he opposed expanding the Utah Supreme Court at this time “as a fiscal conservative.” 
“The amount of money that would be spent to increase the number of justices on the Supreme Court is probably the least effective way to give some assistance to the judiciary right now,” Connors said. “It would be much more effective to take that money and add additional district court judges to those you’ve already agreed to add.” 
In its 2026 report to the Legislature, the judiciary cited a 2025 judicial caseload study that showed district court judicial officers “carrying an average of 112% of a standard caseload, with some districts operating at 122%.” In order to meet “statutory and judicial time standards,” that study identified a need for 12 additional judicial officers. Currently, the state has 89 district court judicial officers; that study called for at least 101.

“Workload growth continues to outpace available resources. Over the past 12 years, hearings increased by 25% and warrant activity by 190%, while the number of district court judges increased by only 8%,” the report says. 
Linda Smith, a Salt Lake City resident and a retired law professor, said “we should listen to the courts regarding what their needs are.” 
“I find them to be very honorable people who will be straight with you,” she said, while arguing against expanding the Utah Supreme Court for “efficiency reasons.” 
Smith said adding two justices to the court would not speed up decisions, but likely lengthen deliberation time because justices collaborate on opinions. She acknowledged, however, that adding more members could have some advantages, including the “possibility of having a more diverse body if you have more people, and I think that has value.”
“I don’t know that there’s a right size, I just don’t think today, with the courts’ requests, is the time to expand the Supreme Court,” Smith said. 
Sen. Stephanie Pitcher, D-Salt Lake City, was the lone “no” vote against Wilson’s bill. 
“One thing that I think is clear from the judiciary is that our lower courts need resources, that the caseloads have increased dramatically, and that the resources that the Legislature is providing is not enough,” Pitcher said. “Ultimately I trust the judiciary to tell us what they need. I don’t think this is the solution.”

Weiler said he agrees with Pitcher “that the court needs more resources,” but he voted in favor of the bill. To accusations of court packing, Weiler noted that before tensions between the courts and the Legislature rose in recent years, “this was something that I was publicly exploring.” 
“But it’s expensive,” Weiler said, adding “that’s a big lift for one bill without leadership support.” 
Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, also supported the bill, even though he noted he has had concerns about “efficiency” of the Utah Supreme Court. 
“I’m not necessarily sure that adding more justices adds to that efficiency, but I do think that having more eyes on things is helpful to getting good reasoning,” he said, while also adding he believes the “most acute problem with the courts is the lack of district court judges.” 
Brammer said SB134 would grant the most new resources to Utah’s courts “in a long, long time.” He said district court judges “work incredibly hard, they’re trying their best, their case loads are out of control, and they need help.”
Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, also voted in favor of it because she viewed the amendment to add three district court judges as a way to “start addressing the lower court needs.”
“This is just a first step,” Escamilla said.

Responsible forest management can reduce smoke, carbon emissions and wildfire risk.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bob Warrington: Controlled burns protect Vermont’s air.","Dear Editor,
The smoke-filled, unhealthy air quality last summer reminded us all again how wildfires out West and in Canada still affect us here in Vermont. 
Beyond our exposure to smoke and particulate matter, the massive amounts of carbon dioxide released further stoke global warming and increase the likelihood of more wildfires.
Risk of severe forest fires centers on the density and dryness of the trees, shrubs, grasses and forest debris that act as fuel.

While we value trees for their carbon storage capacities, too high a level of tree density makes them compete for resources—such as water, sunlight and nutrients—rendering them weaker and creating more debris, which provides a continuous bed of highly flammable elements in the forest. 
Controlled burns and responsible forest thinning can decrease excessive fuel as well as increase resilience to extreme drought. The U.S. Forest Service estimates some 80 million acres need restoration management, but it is only conducting controlled burns on about 2 million acres annually. 
One big reason for such slow progress is that the permitting processes are unduly cumbersome, adding years to the implementation of mitigation plans.
The revised Fix Our Forests Act (FOFA), currently under consideration in Congress, removes bureaucratic permitting roadblocks that slow wildfire mitigation projects, while also protecting endangered species. 
In a rare bipartisan effort, the Senate has voted it out of committee. We urge you to contact Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Peter Welch, D-Vt., and Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., telling them we need this legislation to help protect us from smoke and particulate-filled air.

(Photo by Aspen Ford/Washington State Standard)It was more than a year ago when voters approved a ballot measure to protect access to natural gas service in homes and other buildings, undercutting Washington’s efforts to transition away from fossil fuels.  
The fate of that initiative now rests with the state Supreme Court. 
The justices heard arguments Thursday morning in a challenge environmental groups and local governments brought against Initiative 2066. They argue the measure is unconstitutional because it covers more than a single subject and does not contain the full text of state laws it would alter.
Last March, a King County Superior Court judge agreed. Backers of the initiative appealed, landing the case at the state’s highest court. 
The Building Industry Association of Washington, a trade group for homebuilders, sponsored the initiative and is defending it alongside the state. The state has to defend the initiative because it was passed by voters, even though lawmakers have previously approved policies that it conflicts with.  
“The people of Washington enacted 2066 for one singular purpose: to ensure that they had the option of gas as a source of energy for their homes and their buildings,” said Callie Castillo, an attorney for the Building Industry Association. 
The pro-gas initiative passed in November 2024 with 51.7% of the statewide vote. It includes provisions to ensure customers will have a supply of natural gas, for appliances like furnaces and stoves, and that providers will continue to have consumer demand, proponents said in a court filing.

“Initiative 2066 is constitutional,” said Karl Smith, deputy solicitor general at the Washington State Office of the Attorney General. “Each of the provisions is germane to the general subject of protecting access to and use of natural gas.”
But a coalition of environmental and clean energy organizations, along with the city of Seattle and King County, contends that the ballot measure “does far more” than protect access to natural gas. 
They claim that the multi-part initiative, which ran 21 pages, would change building code rules, air pollution regulation authority, repeal provisions to accelerate Puget Sound Energy’s transition away from natural gas and limit local governments’ ability to establish energy efficiency standards. 
Paul Lawrence, attorney for the groups and local governments challenging the initiative, called the provisions “silent amendments” to existing law. 
“‘Stop the gas ban,’ was BIAW’s motto for having people sign and vote for this,” said Lawrence, adding that the pitch for the initiative was “combined with much broader attacks” on state climate policy and building codes.

In a friend-of-the-court brief filed in the case, former Gov. Jay Inslee, who championed climate policy during his time in office, along with Sen. Rebecca Saldaña, D-Seattle, Rep. Beth Doglio, D-Olympia, and House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle, argued the initiative would dismantle years of policy to curb air pollution, protect public health and transition to cleaner energy. 
Doglio, the House and Environment Energy Committee chair, sponsored the legislation related to Puget Sound Energy that the initiative would roll back. 
The building codes the measure targets were designed to get more electric heat pumps installed in newly built homes and other buildings.
“Do the voters want to preserve access to natural gas and also undermine several statutes that have been enacted over the years to promote a policy of looking at sustainable, clean energy housing?” Lawrence said in court Thursday, as he argued that the initiative was too broad.
He expressed confidence afterward that the Supreme Court would reach the same conclusion as the lower court judge.
Greg Lane, executive vice president of the Building Industry Association of Washington, said the group hopes that “the court will recognize the urgency of this case” and provide a ruling swiftly.
“The 546,000 citizens who signed the initiative and the nearly 2 million voters who supported its passage deserve a resolution soon,” he said.

The decision was filed Wednesday in Fulton County Superior Court. Durand, who founded a watchdog organization called Georgians for Affordable Energy and is a frequent critic of the Public Service Commission, had been charged with one felony count of theft of trade secrets following an incident at a Public Service Commission meeting in October. Durand was captured on video picking up the booklet during a lunch break.
The original charge could carry a penalty of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $50,000.
“Although I am pleased with the outcome of my particular case, Georgia Power customers deserve more transparency and accountability in proceedings at the Georgia Public Service Commission,” Durand said in a statement Thursday. “The extensive redactions and trade secrets Georgia’s commissioners allow are outside of regulatory norms and continue to harm Georgia Power customers. It’s wrong and it needs to end.”

The district attorney’s office in the filing highlighted several legal shortcomings in the case, saying that the arrest warrant fails to claim that Durand actually intended to steal anything from Georgia Power or that the booklet contained any information that was a protected, valuable secret.
Matthew Kent, a spokesperson for Georgia Power, pointed to a previous statement saying that confidential data is meant to protect customers’ interests, and that revealing trade secrets can harm their business operations. A message seeking comment was left with a spokesperson for PSC.
Prosecutors also wrote that two people were tasked with supervising the protected information, but they were not paying attention at the time of the incident. They also found that Durand’s actions did not financially hurt the utility.
“Georgia Power further confirmed that the Defendant’s taking of the booklet did not result in any actual financial harm to Georgia Power,” the prosecutors wrote in the court document.
Furthermore, the prosecutors said that Durand “voluntarily returned the notebook” on the same day it was taken. The warrant also failed to establish that the information inside the booklet was “subject to efforts that were reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy” or that the information was “not commonly known by or available to the public.”
As part of the resolution, Durand completed a four-hour theft awareness class, and the district attorney has requested that the court restrict access to her criminal history record for this case.
Durand, a former Democratic candidate for the commission, indicated she plans to continue her advocacy through her newsletter, which she said has a subscriber base of 7,000, and by engaging with newly elected commissioners Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson, who flipped two Republican-held seats in November by running on energy affordability.
“I don’t have a game plan other than to ask the new commissioners to object to the high levels of trade secret information, whereas previously no commissioners had done so,” Durand said.
Hubbard said in a statement Thursday that he is committed to transparency and believes the “public benefits when dockets are as open and transparent as possible,” pointing to testimony he provided the commission previously calling attention to other state utilities that provide the public with information about infrastructure costs.
“I also hope to maintain the public trust that I earned as an advocate and intervenor on behalf of consumers, such that I am reviewing all information in the dockets before the Commission and will look with a critical eye at what was vs. what was not designated trade secret and what can be moved in the public disclosure category,” Hubbard said.

(Naomi Delkamiller/Nebraska News Service)LINCOLN — Two proposals with competing visions for the future of voting in Nebraska show some differences between how the two major political parties approach voting regulations. 
Both state constitutional amendments were heard Thursday in the Nebraska Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee. One, from a Democrat, would lower the voting age to 16 from 18. The other, from a Republican, would tweak the state constitution to say only U.S. citizens can vote in elections, which is already a requirement. 
Dona-Gene Barton, a political scientist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who studies political behavior, said the amendments offer a glimpse of how some Democrats and Republicans, at the state and federal level, view voting regulations. As an example, she pointed to recent bills in the GOP-led statehouse, which is officially nonpartisan. 
Voting-rights advocacy organization Civic Nebraska said the age-lowering proposal from Democrats “strengthens democracy” and questioned the GOP proposal’s new language on citizenship as unnecessary, saying it risks reinforcing “misinformation.” 
Republican Secretary of State Bob Evnen described the GOP proposal on citizenship as “important,” while the Government Committee’s GOP majority questioned the value of the Democratic proposal for lowering the state’s voting age.

Niobrara State Sen. Barry DeKay’s Legislative Resolution 283 would specify in the state constitution that only U.S. citizens can vote in all Nebraska elections. DeKay said he wants to “make it clear” on who can and can’t vote because, to him and others, he said, there is some “ambiguity.”
Currently, the section of the state constitution that details who can vote — Article VI, Section 1 — says “every citizen.” 
DeKay’s constitutional amendment is cosponsored by six of his fellow Republicans: State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, Loren Lippincott of Central City, Dave Murman of Glenvil, Brian Hardin of Gering, Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue and Bob Andersen of western Sarpy County. 
“This should be a bipartisan issue that everybody should be on board [with] … saying, ‘Hey, everybody, that a citizen should have the right to vote,’” DeKay told the Examiner.
Evnen’s office, which supports DeKay’s proposal, confirms that no local elections in Nebraska allow non-citizens to vote, so nothing would change if voters approved the language. Federal and state elections in Nebraska already require voters to be U.S. citizens.

DeKay pointed to other states where some cities allow non-citizens to vote in municipal or local elections, including Washington D.C and some municipalities in Vermont, Maryland and California. 
Nine conservative-led states have recently passed similar constitutional amendments to his, including Texas, where voters approved a citizen-voting amendment last year. 
The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, analyzed elections from 2003 to 2024 and found 24 instances nationally of noncitizens voting out of millions of votes cast. 
A lobbyist for Americans for Citizen Voting, a group that has backed such measures elsewhere based in Virginia, testified at Thursday’s hearing, saying it’s a “pretty simple, straightforward change.”
Tanner Cano, a spokesperson for Civic Nebraska, disagreed, calling DeKay’s proposal “unnecessary.” 
“This measure does not address a demonstrated need and would place a misleading question before voters without improving election administration or security,” Cano said. 
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, a member of the Government Committee, said of the proposal, “It’s a dangerous situation when you start wanting to clarify ambiguities.”
Barton, the UNL professor, said she sees a trend of some Nebraska state leaders echoing concerns of some national Republicans and President Donald Trump over election integrity since the 2020 presidential election, which election experts warn could undermine trust in elections. 
Those concerns have influenced state policy proposals. Among some recent examples: Nebraskans passed a state constitutional amendment in 2022 requiring the Legislature to implement voter ID. 
Last year, a bill from State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue aimed to eliminate online voter registration, restrict absentee voting, provide more security for ballot boxes and require hand-counting of election results. 
Over the past year, Evnen has started more frequently discussing the need to address public fears of widespread voting by non-citizens, which election experts call a myth. He is seeking reelection. 
Evnen’s support for DeKay’s constitutional amendment echoed that emphasis. Evnen said it’s important to constitutionally reaffirm the citizenship requirement to vote.

“Especially during a time when millions of people have walked across the U.S. border in recent years without the legal right to do so, there are those who believe that noncitizens should be able to vote,” Evnen said in his statement. “I reject that idea.” 
This session, Andersen has introduced a bill that would require the secretary of state to create a process to use the Department of Homeland Security’s Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements system to verify citizenship and tighten the delivery and handling of ballots by poll watchers. 
In the same committee Thursday, State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha made the case for his Legislative Resolution 284, which would let Nebraska voters consider lowering the state’s voting age to 16 from 18. 
McKinney said he wants to get younger people “more engaged in the political process.” He said it’s an opportunity to make sure younger people are prepared to lead.
“We make a lot of decisions here that’re gonna affect them for the rest of their lives … [and] they have no say so,” McKinney said. 
Last year, the British government announced it would lower the voting age to 16. There have been multiple attempts by congressional Democrats to lower the voting age, but those proposals gained little traction. 
Cano, of Civic Nebraska, said McKinney’s proposal is forward-looking. 
“Allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to vote recognizes that young Nebraskans already take on significant responsibilities, are capable of informed decision-making and have a strong stake in the long-term impacts of public policy,” Cano said. 
His organization pointed to research showing early participation builds lifelong voting habits and increases civic engagement across entire households.
State Sen. Dan Lonowski of Hastings questioned one testifier in support, asking whether the draft age also should be lowered to 16. 
Some cities in California, New Jersey and Maryland hold municipal elections that allow 16-year olds to vote. 
A handful of high schoolers from Lincoln and Omaha expressed support for McKinney’s proposal. 
Holly Bowen, a junior at Lincoln Southeast High School, said she is subject to a state policy that she has no say in, citing the state’s recent policy changes in higher education as an example.   
“I don’t know if I would be able to consider committing to Nebraska if the state I grew up in still doesn’t want to hear my voice,” Bowen said. 
Another high schooler pointed to 16-year-olds paying taxes and driving as one reason why they should be able to vote. 
State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul, who replaced former State Sen. Dan McKeon in central Nebraska, said paying taxes doesn’t give a person the right to vote. Lonowski said he doesn’t want to “tie” driving and voting together.  
“We have pretty well established 250 years ago that there’s no connection between paying taxes and voting,” Meyer said. 
McKinney, a Democrat, said “we’ll see” on whether there’s any appetite to move the bill forward. Lonowski, in the hearing, called lowering the voting age to 16 “an intriguing topic.” 
Said McKinney: “We need to be more open-minded to things like this if we want to make our society a better one.”

Sharon Henderson on the first day of the 2026 Legislative session. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGov. Brian Kemp has suspended from office a Democratic lawmaker charged with unemployment fraud in connection with COVID-19 pandemic relief.
Kemp, a Republican, announced Thursday that Rep. Sharon Henderson would be suspended from office until her case is resolved or her term ends. All members of the Legislature are up for re-election in November.
Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Henderson, a Covington Democrat, with fraudulently collecting $17,811 in unemployment benefits from a federal program meant to support people who lost their jobs during the pandemic.
Prosecutors said Henderson applied for the program in 2020 when she was a House candidate, falsely claiming that she had been an employee of the Henry County School District in 2019 and 2020, and was laid off due to the pandemic. The Justice Department alleges that Henderson had only spent five days working for Henry County Schools as a substitute teacher in 2018 and was not eligible for unemployment benefits.
Kemp’s announcement came after a panel consisting of Attorney General Chris Carr, House Speaker Pro Tem Jan Jones and Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones issued a report finding that Henderson’s indictment adversely affects the public.
Henderson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
House Minority Leader Carolyn Hugley declined to comment Thursday.
In a statement, Henderson’s attorney, Gerald Griggs, vowed to continue fighting.
“We respectfully disagree with the Governor’s decision and will continue to litigate this matter in a courtroom,” Griggs said.
Earlier this month former state Rep. Karen Bennett of Stone Mountain resigned her seat days before authorities charged her with allegedly defrauding the same program. She pleaded guilty Wednesday to making false statements to obtain the aid, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Northern District of Georgia.

“Remarkably Bright Creatures” by Shelby Van Pelt – 2,159 checkouts


“Fourth Wing” by Rebecca Yarros – 2,093 checkouts

Library representatives of the state’s second most populous city said that last year residents borrowed more than 3 million items from the eight Lincoln city libraries and the Lied Bookmobile.
“This year’s lists highlight a wide range of genres and authors, while also showing longtime favorites that continue to resonate strongly with our patrons,” said Rebecca Aracena, support services coordinator.
The library system has compiled Top 10 checkout lists for other categories, including adult nonfiction, young adult series, authors and movies.  
Among list leaders: James Patterson, author; Wicked Part I, movies; Sonic Superstars, video games; “That’s Not My Name” by Megan Lally, young adult stand-alone, and “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” for juvenile series. 
In addition to books, e-books and audiobooks, Lincoln public libraries also loans ukuleles, guitars, video games and movies and provides free access to dozens of databases.

Bill Lee has declared a state of emergency ahead of a massive winter storm predicted. Gov. Bill Lee on Thursday issued a state of emergency for all 95 counties ahead of a major winter storm expected to sweep across the state this weekend.
Snow, ice, freezing rain and freezing temperatures are possible beginning with light snow Friday night, according to the National Weather Service. 
Saturday is expected to bring a mix of freezing rain and sleet, transitioning to snow on Sunday morning. Frigid temperatures in the single digits are expected to last into early next week, according to NWS.
Portions of the state could see snow and sleet accumulations in excess of six inches, according to weather forecasts. Ice accumulations of a quarter inch or more are most likely along and south of Interstate 40.
Dangerous travel, power outages and potential downed trees and tree branches are possible, and cold temperatures are likely to prolong the storm’s impacts.
Lee’s office urged Tennesseans to stay off of roadways unless travel is essential. Tennessee Department of Transportation teams have begun pretreating roadways — focusing on interstates and state routes first — and Tennessee Highway Patrol will be working at all hours during the storm.
The state’s level 3 emergency status allows state resources to support local requests for assistance and activates the Tennessee Emergency Management Plan. More information, including warming center locations and safety tips, are available on TEMA’s January 2026 Winter Weather page.
Portions of West and Middle Tennessee are under a winter storm warning, and several southwest Tennessee counties are under an ice storm warning, according to NWS. East Tennessee is under a winter storm watch.

Joanne Ferrary presided over a House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee hearing on a bill that would prohibit public bodies in the state from entering immigrant-detention contracts. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)New Mexico lawmakers advanced an immigration detention bill out of committee Thursday afternoon after Republican representatives warned it could irreparably harm rural economies.
House Bill 9, known as the Immigrant Safety Act, would prohibit government entities across the state from signing contracts to detain people for federal immigration violations. Lawmakers on the House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee voted 4-2 to move the bill.
“An economy built on cages is not development — it is dependency,” Rep. Angelica Rubio (D-Las Cruces), one of the bill’s co-sponsors, said during the hearing. She said she has tried to pass similar legislation for a decade. 
The move came as dozens of immigrants arrested in Minneapolis were shipped to the Torrance County Detention Facility, which is run by private prison operator CoreCivic, in New Mexico. One of them, 33-year-old Jorge Cordoba, told Source NM he lived in Minneapolis for more than 20 years and was in the country legally under protected Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival status.
Republican Representatives Stefani Lord of Sandia Park and John Block of Alamogordo expressed concerns about the proposed bill. They disputed assertions that incarcerated people are mistreated in custody and argued that passing this bill could cause companies like CoreCivic to shut down the facilities and take jobs away from rural New Mexico communities.
“Would you accept an amendment to subsidize my district so that we don’t go bankrupt?” Lord , whose district includes Torrance County, asked committee members during the committee meeting. “There’s been a lot of concern about people in the prison there. What happens when they go to Montana or Florida or Guantanamo Bay? We don’t care anymore, because they’re out of sight, out of mind?”
Block took up Lord’s line of questioning for nearly an hour and asked presenters — who included Rep. Eleanor Chávez (D-Albuquerque), American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico senior attorney Becca Sheff and New Mexico Immigrant Law Center attorney Jessica I. Martinez — if they were OK with the federal government shipping immigrants currently detained in New Mexico elsewhere.
Block’s interrogation ran so long that at one point, committee Chair Rep. Joanne Ferrary (D-Las Cruces) accused him of harassing Chávez, Sheff and Martinez. Later in the afternoon during Block’s questioning, Rubio left the dais to distribute bottled water to testifying experts and some members of the audience.
Residents who spoke during public comment were overwhelmingly in favor of the bill, though Otero County Attorney R.B. Nichols spoke during a virtual public comment period to oppose the bill. He said it would disproportionately harm economies in regions like Otero or Torrance counties that rely on detention centers for jobs.
The bill’s supporters, though, contend that it would not force these facilities to shut down. Many detention centers contract with other law enforcement agencies, such as the U.S. Marshals, and would still detain people accused of crimes.
“We’re disentangling ourselves from the immigration industry that’s been…a money-making, for-profit machine off the backs of our neighbors and families and friends,” Chávez, one of the bill’s sponsors, told Source NM. “I think that it sends a message to the rest of the country.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/HK7A2747-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-22 19:37:13.204425

An Idaho House of Representatives committee on Wednesday approved legislation that would add assisting someone in a mental health or suicidal crisis to Idaho’s Good Samaritan laws.
The House Judiciary and Rules Committee voted 12-2 to send House Bill 491 to the floor, where it may be voted on by the entire chamber. The bill prevents a civil lawsuit from being filed against someone who stops at the scene of an emergency and, “in good faith,” tries to provide assistance, unless they are found to be “grossly negligent.” 
“It’s really saying, ‘hey,’ to the public, ‘we want you intervening,’” bill sponsor Rep. Marco Erickson, R-Idaho Falls, said.
The bill would provide legal immunity from civil legal damages for those who intervene is scenes that include “a mental health or suicidal crisis,” and offer “emergency psychological attention, including responding to suicidal thoughts.” 
Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, asked how the bill would intersect with the parental rights law, passed by the Legislature in 2024. The law prohibits providing any treatment or medical attention to minors under the age of 18 without parental consent, except in narrow circumstances where the child’s life is immediately at risk. 
Erickson said those laws would need to be followed, and the responding person would need to contact the child’s parent. 
The state’s 988 Crisis and Suicide Hotline is affected by the 2024 law, its director told the Idaho Capital Sun previously, and can’t help minors in some situations where they can’t talk to the parent. 
Two people testified in favor of the bill at the hearing Wednesday.  
Boise resident Daniel Murphy told lawmakers that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, he volunteered for the office of former Lt. Gov Janice McGeachin to take calls from people seeking help. A woman called who lost her job, and told Murphy she was contemplating suicide. 
“I was stunned and unprepared for the call,” Murphy said. “I did my best to listen.” 
He said he listened and told her about his own hardship. 
“I said she would do great things and help others as well,” he said. 
He wished he got her phone number so he could follow-up, but later signed up for a suicide intervention skills training course. He favored the bill so people could help those in need without fear of legal retribution. 
Stewart Wilder, co-founder and president of the Idaho Suicide Prevention Coalition, also spoke in favor of the bill. He noted that Wyoming passed a similar law last year.
He appreciated that it would create parity of mental health crises with physical health emergencies. 
The committee voted in favor of sending the bill to the House floor, with Reps. Dale Hawkins, Fernwood, and Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, voting no. 
Reps. Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, and Ted Hill, R-Eagle, were absent.

Why health care costs are driving education spending through the roof.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Flor Diaz Smith: You don’t balance a budget by ignoring the biggest expense.","This commentary is by Flor Diaz Smith, president of the Vermont School Boards Association.



Now that legislators have returned to Montpelier and are back in session, Act 73, the state’s sweeping education reform law, is once again taking center stage. 
Much of the public debate so far has focused on school district mergers, consolidation and governance. Those questions matter. But amid the focus on how schools are organized, we risk overlooking what is driving education costs in the first place. 

READ MORE

One of the largest and fastest-growing pressures on school budgets is employee health care, and no amount of redistricting will make that cost disappear. 
For most Vermont families, when household expenses rise sharply year after year, the first instinct is not to sell the house or merge households with neighbors. 
Families start by looking closely at their budget to understand which costs are growing fastest. When a single bill begins to crowd out groceries, child care, car repairs or savings for the future, it demands attention. 
Vermont’s public education system is facing the same challenge. According to the Public Assets Institute, health insurance costs are growing more than twice as fast as overall education spending. 
That rapid growth is crowding out resources for classrooms and student support services, while placing increasing pressure on property taxpayers across the state. Health care costs are on pace to consume roughly 20% of school budgets based on a projected five-year average increase in health care costs.
These increases show up in very real ways for communities. Rising health care costs translate directly into higher property taxes, fewer dollars for classrooms and educational programs and growing inequities between districts. 
Over the past decade, education spending in Vermont has increased by roughly 40%, even as student enrollment has declined by more than 20%. Much of that growth is driven by health care costs. 
Recent analysis by the School District Redistricting Task Force reinforces this reality. It identified health care as one of the largest cost drivers in Vermont’s education system and found no evidence that changes in district size alone would meaningfully reduce those costs. 
The good news is that there is a practical and balanced path forward. 
Currently, public school employee health care benefits are established through a single statewide agreement that leaves local school boards with little leverage or flexibility, even though boards are responsible for balancing budgets and responding to taxpayers. 
The Vermont School Boards Association (VSBA) has proposed targeted reforms, including adjustments to plan design options, revisions to arbitration rules and expanding the negotiating parties. 
These changes would be more consistent with how health care benefits are negotiated for most other Vermont workers.
The goal of these reforms is to bend the cost curve before health care expenses overwhelm school budgets. That requires acknowledging a hard truth: rising health care costs affect both employers and employees. 
VSBA’s proposals would rebalance the negotiation process so that school employees and local boards have a fair voice in determining benefits and costs, similar to what most other Vermont workers already experience. It may include a more thoughtful look at plan design, cost sharing and other tools that help control growth over time. 
We believe that everyone deserves access to quality, affordable health care. This proposal is not about taking away health care or asking any single group to shoulder the burden alone. 
Moving forward, we need to take a hard, honest look at how benefits are structured and paid for as costs rise. We are all in this together, and this challenge affects everyone in the system, from teachers and support staff to administrators, school boards and taxpayers. 
What we are doing now is not working. By approaching the problem with shared responsibility and transparency, Vermont can preserve strong benefits while creating a system that provides long-term stability and is fair to the communities that support it. 
If Vermonters want public education to be sustainable, lawmakers cannot afford to ignore the impact of health care costs on school budgets. 
Health care is an education issue, a taxpayer issue and an equity issue. It must be front and center in this year’s debate.

Free.,"Mark Kelly illegal orders video not protected speech, Trump DOJ tells court",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/mark-kelly-illegal-orders-video-not-protected-speech-trump-doj-tells-court,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Thursday asked a federal judge to deny Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly’s request to halt efforts within the Defense Department to punish him for appearing in a video where he urged members of the military not to follow illegal orders.Attorneys for the Department of Justice asserted in a 52-page brief that the administration doesn’t believe federal courts hold jurisdiction over the matter, writing “the Judiciary does not superintend military personnel decisions.”Kelly, a retired U.S. Navy captain, “is not a private citizen and does not enjoy the First Amendment freedom of speech as if he were one when being assessed by the military in military proceedings to determine whether his conduct comports with his obligations as a retired servicemember,” the brief states. Kelly’s lawsuit asked a federal judge for an emergency ruling declaring the Defense Department’s attempts to demote him and reduce his military retirement pay are “unlawful and unconstitutional.”The lawsuit alleges the Pentagon’s actions against Kelly “trample on protections the Constitution singles out as essential to legislative independence.” “It appears that never in our nation’s history has the Executive Branch imposed military sanctions on a Member of Congress for engaging in disfavored political speech,” the lawsuit states. ”Allowing that unprecedented step here would invert the constitutional structure by subordinating the Legislative Branch to executive discipline and chilling congressional oversight of the armed forces.”Video rankled PentagonDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced earlier this month that he had started the process to downgrade Kelly’s retirement rank and pay, writing in a social media post that his “status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action.”The Defense Department letter of censure to Kelly alleged that his participation in the video undermined the military chain of command, counseled disobedience, created confusion about duty, brought discredit upon the Armed Forces and included conduct unbecoming of an officer. The video at the center of the debate featured Kelly, Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, Pennsylvania Reps. Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, and New Hampshire Rep. Maggie Goodlander, all Democrats with backgrounds in the military or intelligence community.They said that Americans in those institutions “can” and “must refuse illegal orders.”“No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution. We know this is hard and that it’s a difficult time to be a public servant,” they said. “But whether you’re serving in the CIA, in the Army, or Navy, or the Air Force, your vigilance is critical.”First Amendment doesn’t apply, DOJ saysAttorneys at the Justice Department, representing DOD in the case, argued in the brief they filed Thursday that no emergency relief is warranted, in part, because they believe Kelly’s First Amendment rights have not been violated. “Plaintiff is unlikely to succeed on his First Amendment claim because, as a retired servicemember, he has no First Amendment right to encourage other servicemembers to question the legitimacy of their military orders or to impugn their superior officers when such conduct violates his ongoing duties and obligations to the military,” the DOJ brief states. “The First Amendment is not a shield against the consequences of such violations in military personnel matters.”Kelly’s constitutional protections as a member of the U.S. Senate under the Speech and Debate Clause of the Constitution also don’t apply in this instance, the DOJ legal team wrote. ""A legislator’s public statements in interviews and on social media are not legislative acts protected by the Speech or Debate Clause,"" DOJ wrote. The judge doesn’t need to issue emergency relief, the DOJ brief states, because there isn’t a separation-of-powers issue between the Executive Branch, where the Defense Department exists, and Kelly’s role as a senator in the Legislative Branch, which are considered separate but equal under the Constitution. Senior Judge Richard J. Leon, who was nominated to the bench by President George W. Bush, has scheduled a hearing on the issue for Wednesday. Leon could rule from the bench during those proceedings or issue a written order anytime afterward.",,,,2026-01-22 19:37:13.204425

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has invited all seven Colorado River Basin governors and their negotiators to meet in Washington D.C. next Friday as states approach a federal deadline to reach a voluntary agreement to replace river operating guidelines.
Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo and the state’s top river negotiator, Southern Nevada Water Authority General Manager John Enstminger, are planning to attend the meeting, according to a spokesperson for Enstminger.
The Bureau of Reclamation – which manages water in the West under the Interior Department – initially gave states until Nov. 11 to submit a preliminary agreement for a plan that could replace the river’s operating guidelines set to expire at the end of 2026.
But after states missed the deadline, the Bureau extended the deadline to submit a seven-state agreement for post-2026 operations to Valentine’s Day.
A similar meeting of governors to discuss the status of negotiations was planned for December, but was cancelled due to scheduling challenges. River negotiators for Utah and New Mexico said they could not accept the December invitation because their state governors had prior commitments that could not be moved. 
Lombardo responded by sending a letter to Burgum affirming Nevada’s commitment to achieving a seven-state agreement, and requesting that the meeting be rescheduled for early January.
As of Thursday, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, and Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs also planned to attend the new meeting next week, reported Fox 13 in Salt Lake City.
Negotiators for the seven states that share the Colorado River also met in Salt Lake City last week for a two-and-a-half day meeting, according to the Utah News Dispatch.
Utah’s chief negotiator Gene Shawcroft said they made little progress on a deal, but were committed to continuing negotiations and meeting their upcoming Feb. 14 deadline.
Current negotiations are largely focused on operational terms for an initial five-year period after 2026, with longer-term provisions to be addressed if a seven-state agreement can be reached on the near-term framework.
One of the biggest disagreements between the Lower Basin states — Nevada, Arizona, and California — and Upper Basin states — Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming — is over which faction should have to cut back on their water use, and by how much.
Lower Basin states want all seven Colorado River states to share mandatory water cuts during dry years under the new guidelines. The Upper Basin, which is not subject to mandatory cuts under the current guidelines, say they already use much less water than downstream states and should not face additional cuts during shortages.
State negotiators for both the Upper and Lower Basin have said they would prefer a seven-state agreement than the alternative river management options proposed by the federal government.
The Bureau of Reclamation will still need to go through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process so they can assess the environmental impact of the plan before issuing a final decision on new guidelines for the river’s management.
A final environmental review is expected in summer 2026 and will include either a seven-state consensus agreement or a federal alternative in its place. A final decision must be completed by no later than September 2026, to guide operations at Lake Powell beginning October 1, 2026, and at Lake Mead beginning January 1, 2027.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/020225_Lake-Powell_26-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-22 19:37:13.204425

Martinez, Rep. Eleanor Chávez (D-Albuquerque) and American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico senior attorney Becca Sheff brief the House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee regarding an immigration detention ban on Jan. 22, 2026. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)The current 30-day legislative session and subsequent interim committees could cost New Mexico more than $66 million.
The House of Representatives on Thursday passed House Bill 1, commonly known as the “Feed Bill,” a formality that picks up the tab for the work that goes into the legislative session.
The bill, sponsored by State Majority Floor Leader Rep. Reena Szczepanski (D-Santa Fe), would set aside $66.6 million for the 30-day legislative session as well as the activities of interim committees such as the Legislative Finance Committee and Legislative Education Study Committee.
While state lawmakers do not collect a salary for their part-time gigs in the Roundhouse, the feed bill calls for $7.2 million to pay for their per diem and mileage reimbursements, as well as staff member salaries. If approved, it would also appropriate $49 million for recurring expenses at legislative offices, according to a fiscal impact report.
It has yet to be signed into law.
Immigration detention ban
In the afternoon, lawmakers voted to advance a bill that would prohibit public bodies across the state from entering into immigrant detention contracts. House Bill 9, known as the Immigrant Safety Act, would prevent any public entity in New Mexico from entering into a contract to detain immigrants — and it would mandate the cancelation of any such existing contracts. 
Dozens of immigrants apprehended in Minneapolis are currently being held in the Torrance County Detention Facility.
Money for something
The Senate Finance Committee convened Thursday morning to discuss capital outlay spending — the money set aside for large projects, like repairing a highway or redoing the stucco on a local library — and general obligation bonds. For months, lawmakers have remained optimistic about their ability to pay for projects that require one-time funding, but “recurring” spending, like hiring new employees at state agencies or shouldering more of the cost of employee health care premiums, is more imperiled this year.
Lawmakers reviewed an interactive online dashboard, caps.nm.gov, which lets residents explore and review capital projects in their communities. Cally Carswell, Legislative Finance Committee principal analyst for capital outlay, told lawmakers they have roughly 2,300 requests for direct appropriations, totaling about $3.7 billion.
“You have a lot of demand for what is a pretty limited pot of funding each year,” she said.
Clear skies ahead?
Also Thursday, Sen Pro Tempore Sen. Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) reintroduced Senate Bill 18, also called the Clear Horizons Act, which if enacted would enshrine state emission reduction goals into state law. A copy of the legislation was not available on the Legislature’s website immediately Thursday afternoon.
Based on an executive order Lujan Grisham issued in 2019, the bill would set goals to reduce greenhouse gas emission levels by 45% in 2030, 75% in 2040 and 100% in 2050 of the emission levels in 2005. It would also allow state agencies to plan and measure the state’s pollution levels. The bill would apply to polluters who emit greater than “10,000 tons individually,” according to a news release from Senate Democrats. 
“We’ve shown that clean energy can lower costs and strengthen our economy,” Stewart said in a statement. “This bill ensures we have the tools to responsibly manage the energy needs of the future, while holding the biggest polluters accountable and protecting the health and livelihoods of everyday New Mexicans.”
Similar legislation introduced last year failed to clear the Senate Finance Committee. SB18 was assigned to the Senate Conservation Committee.
Workers Day in the Rotunda

Sarah Hager, vice president of membership and involvement for the Albuquerque Teachers Union, told Source that Workers Day came about to bring together labor unions and workers of all types to focus on shared interests.
“We know that we can’t do anything by ourselves, especially in one single union, and so when we had the idea and were invited to be a part of this coalition with not only labor but workers, we thought that it was a wonderful opportunity,” she said. 
Part of the coalition is the New Mexico Dream Team, which advocates for immigrants targeted by ICE in New Mexico and elsewhere. Shortly before the House Committee began debating HB9, Fernanda Banda, co-executive director of the New Mexico Dream Team, led a gathered crowd in the rotunda in cheers and song to express support for the Immigrant Safety Act. 
She described her father’s ICE arrest and deportation nearly a decade ago and called on lawmakers to take any action they can not to support the agency that she said stole her father. Many congressional Democrats on Thursday (including New Mexico’s delegation) refused to fund ICE as part of spending packages to keep the government open (the bill passed nonetheless).
“New Mexico can continue to be complicit in Trump’s deportation machine, putting profit over people,” she said. Or we can choose to end the contracts that cage our people, keep families together and choose to do the right thing. History is watching us.”

On Friday afternoon, the Senate Health and Public Affairs Committee is scheduled to discuss Senate Bill 6, which proposes nearly $547 million for a new school of medicine facility at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.

Instead, such a transfer would require the joint action of all three of the authority’s governing municipalities, the court said in the 5-1 decision.","The Pennsylvania Supreme Court July, 2024 (Jen Barker Worley/ Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts)A long-running court battle over the cash-strapped city of Chester’s water authority ended Wednesday with a state Supreme Court ruling that rejects its sale to a for-profit company, for now.
The justices blocked the city’s financial guardian from unilaterally forcing a transfer of the Chester Water Authority’s assets to the city government. Instead, such a transfer would require the joint action of all three of the authority’s governing municipalities, the court said in the 5-1 decision.
“The decision draws a clear line between public ownership and privatization,” CWA Board Chairperson Noël Brandon said. “The court sided with everyday residents who drink CWA water and affirmed that the authority belongs to its customers — not to a receiver, politicians, or private interests. This ruling should set an important precedent for similar cases across Pennsylvania.”

In the majority opinion, Justice Christine Donohue said the lower Commonwealth Court erred by determining the city could seize the water authority’s assets. It did so by incorrectly relying on its own prior caselaw and overlooking a 1957 state Supreme Court decision that held a transfer would require the CWA board’s approval.
Acquisition of public water and sewer companies by investor-owned companies has been a frequent subject of judicial and legislative scrutiny since 2016, when the state passed a law known as Act 12.
Signed by then-Gov. Tom Wolf, the law allows municipal water and sewer utilities to negotiate with for-profit utilities for the fair market value rather than the actual value of the system. The higher purchase prices, in turn, give new owners a basis to seek approval to charge higher rates. They usually receive them, consumer advocates testified during a 2023 hearing before a state House panel.
Critics say Act 12 has resulted in soaring water and sewer bills for hundreds of thousands of customers across the state.
Chester, once a prosperous port and shipbuilding city on the Delaware River, has suffered decades of disinvestment and decline. It entered receivership in 2020 and filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy in 2022 to restructure its pension and retiree healthcare debt. 
Court-appointed Receiver Vijay Kapoor contends that the water authority, established by the city in 1939, was “stolen without compensation.” In October, he moved to amend the city’s recovery plan to address issues of the authority’s ownership and rate hikes.
Initially, the city drew water from the Delaware River, according to the Supreme Court’s opinion. In 1945, the CWA constructed a reservoir by damming Octoraro Creek in southwest Chester County, more than 40 miles from the city. 
Since the reservoir began supplying water, the CWA has expanded to supply around 200,000 people in the suburban Philadelphia counties of Delaware and Chester. The authority’s board is now composed of members appointed by Chester city and Delaware and Chester counties. 
In 2017, the board rejected an unsolicited $320 million bid to buy CWA’s assets from publicly-traded water company Aqua. Brandon, the board’s chairperson, warned in a statement after the decision that monetizing the authority remains Kapoor’s only strategy to address Chester city’s financial problems
Several CWA board members who opposed the transfer have terms that end in 2027, meaning that authority’s future is in the hands of Chester City Council, Delaware County Council, the Chester County commissioners and the replacements they select.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image002-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-22 18:56:28.183244

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Lawmakers advanced an energy policy bill Thursday from a House subcommittee, but asked for suggestions to improve the bill from utilities and ratepayer organizations who voiced concern about the bill. 
House Study Bill 519 would expand the projects eligible for certain ratemaking principles in Iowa and encourage nuclear energy and energy storage projects. 
While major utilities MidAmerican Energy Company and Alliant Energy Corporation registered as undecided on the bill, lobbyists from both utilities expressed concerns with the bill. 
Matt Hinch, speaking on behalf of MidAmerican Energy, said Iowa already has “one of the best regulatory structures in the nation.” Hinch said the proof of that is “in the pudding” as Iowans have some of the lowest rates in the country. According to MidAmerican figures, Iowa electricity rates are 44% below the national average. 
“Anytime you’re looking at these policies, we would ask you to just do so cautiously, because what we have in place here in the state of Iowa is working,” Hinch said. “It is protecting customers, and the rates prove it out.” 
Bob Rafferty on behalf of Iowa Business for Clean Energy said the bill “significantly enlarges” the advanced ratemaking process. This process allows the Iowa Utilities Commission to preauthorize the recovered costs from eligible facilities as a means of addressing uncertainty from rate-regulated utilities toward certain generation projects.
Rafferty said expanding the projects eligible for advanced ratemaking is “not a bad idea” but he said before that can be done, the state needs to reform the advanced ratemaking process. He the current process does not have strong standards to keep ratepayers from bearing the cost of new investments.
“I would suggest if we’re going to expand advanced ratemaking, we make sure that investment, the standard, is it’s in the best interest of the ratepayer,” Rafferty said. 
Ted Stopulos, representing Alliant Energy, said while the company agreed with changes to ratemaking in the bill, it had “concerns” with a section of the bill that would tie a utility’s return on equity for wind and solar systems to the utility’s most recent rate proceeding. 
Stopulos said this could cause a utility’s return on equity to be “applied in an unjust manner” or be unreflective of current and future market conditions. He asked the committee to remove the provision from the bill. 
“We believe an all-of-the-above energy strategy is the best strategy, and putting the thumb on the scale one way or another hinders that policy objective,” Stopulos said. 
Robert Palmer, speaking on behalf of the Iowa Business Energy Coalition – a group advocating for business energy users – echoed the sentiments of Stopulos and suggested the Iowa Utilities Commission continue to evaluate utilities’ return on equity rather than tie it to a rate proceeding.
Palmer also highlighted a section of the bill that reads: “It is also the intent of the general assembly to encourage the development of nuclear electric power generation within the state.” He said the wording may lead to the IUC prioritizing nuclear projects, even in circumstances where “other technologies may be valuable.”
The bill is similar to a section of Gov. Kim Reynolds’ 2025 energy bill, which energy groups like Rafferty’s and several former members of the Iowa Utilities Commission opposed. Opponents of the bill argued last spring that it would give utilities freedom to add capital investments at the expense of ratepayers.
The subcommittee chair, Rep. Hans Wilz, R-Ottumwa, said there was not an intentional move, on his part, to split apart sections of the governor’s bill into new bills this session.
“I didn’t go back and look at old bills, I look at what’s in front of me,” Wilz said. “I think every one of those sections has ideas that have been past, present and soon to be future.” 
After briefly closing the meeting so lawmakers could confer in private, subcommittee members said they would advance the bill, but asked all of the interested and attending stakeholders to send the subcommittee representatives an email explaining suggestions that “would make this better.”

The other, in Florida federal court, accused Trump of mishandling classified documents. Grand juries indicted Trump in both cases but the Justice Department dropped both cases after Trump’s 2024 election victory, consistent with department policy that forbids prosecution of a sitting president.Trump attempting ‘intimidation’Midway through the five-hour hearing, Trump posted to Truth Social his analysis of the meeting and a veiled threat against Smith.“Deranged Jack Smith is being DECIMATED before Congress,” he wrote. “If he were a Republican, his license would be taken away from him, and far worse! Hopefully the Attorney General is looking at what he’s done, including some of the crooked and corrupt witnesses that he was attempting to use in his case against me. The whole thing was a Democrat SCAM — A big price should be paid by them for what they have put our Country through!”In the hearing room, Smith directly rejected charges he was motivated by partisanship, and said he would not give in to intimidation attempts by Trump.“If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether that president was a Democrat or a Republican,” he said. “No one — no one — should be above the law in this country.”Vermont Democrat Becca Balint noted Trump had used the term “Deranged Jack Smith” 185 times on Truth Social. “I think … the statements are meant to intimidate me. I will not be intimidated. I think these statements are also made as a warning to others what will happen if they stand up,” Smith responded. “We did our work pursuant to department policy,” he continued. “We followed the facts, we followed the law, and that process resulted in proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he committed serious crimes. I'm not going to pretend that didn't happen because he's threatening me.”Phone recordsSeveral committee Republicans challenged Smith’s pursuit of phone records from members of Congress related to the election interference case.The case included an examination of Trump’s attempt to block Congress’ certification of the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, on Jan. 6, 2021. Smith and other prosecutors sought phone logs leading up to the eventual attack on the Capitol that day.Republicans on the panel accused Smith of violating Congress’ rights as a co-equal branch of government and took further umbrage at efforts by Smith and his colleagues to keep the records requests secret, and noted that only Republicans’ records had been sought.Jordan said his phone records were among those obtained, and described the entire investigation as a partisan attack on Trump.“Even the Democrats said this was wrong,” he said. “We shouldn't be surprised. Democrats have been going after President Trump for 10 years, for a decade, and the country should never, ever forget what they did.”Smith said the investigation had to do with Trump’s pressure campaign on members of Congress to object to the election results, including appeals to Republicans’ partisan loyalties. If the president had been a Democrat, he’d have sought Democrats’ records, he said.He and Democrats on the panel also noted that the phone records only included data like the length, time and date of phone calls, without disclosing anything about their content. Such records are typical pieces of conspiracy investigations, they said.Complimentary DemsDemocrats complimented and defended Smith throughout the hearing. “Special Counsel Smith, you pursued the facts,” ranking Democrat Jamie Raskin of Maryland said. “You followed every applicable law, ethics rule and DOJ regulation. Your decisions were reviewed by the Public Integrity Section. You acted based solely on the facts.”Raskin contrasted Smith’s approach with that of Trump, who he said sought unprecedented control over the Justice Department to pursue “political vendetta and motives of personal revenge.”Several other Democratic members held Smith up as an exemplary public servant.“I want to thank you for your service,” Tennessee Democrat Steve Cohen said. “I think you're a great American, and you came out of this as being somebody who people can respect and look up to,” he said. “We should be instilling people's desire to go into justice, to go into law, to go into government. You're an example of the type of person they should follow.”",,,,2026-01-22 18:56:28.183244

(Courtesy Office of the Attorney General)Republican Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman is asking the state legislature for more funding for a grant program within his office that’s provided law enforcement with body armor.
Coleman during a Thursday press conference with the University of Kentucky Police Department on the university campus said about 20% of law enforcement in the state didn’t have usable body armor. The GOP-controlled legislature allocated $15 million to the attorney general in 2024 to start the program. 
Coleman said the grant program has since provided more than 2,000 protective vests to law enforcement including 29 vests to the University of Kentucky Police Department. He said he’s asking the legislature for another $20 million over the two fiscal years to also buy law enforcement more protective equipment including shields, plates and helmets. 
He said he wants future funding to protect school resource officers.

(Photo illustration by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Slightly more than 47,000 people have filed claims in a class action suit over the 2024 RIBridges data breach, according to a court filing Thursday from the court-appointed settlement administrator.
Kroll Settlement Administration, the national firm handling the claims, sent postcards to 729,946 people whose personal information was compromised by the breach of the state’s public benefit and health insurance portal. These class members could pursue one of two reimbursements under the settlement terms. Those with documented losses related to the breach could apply for up to $5,000, while all class members were permitted a flat, approximately $100 payment sans proof. 
Class members could also submit claims for two years of medical data monitoring in addition to whatever payout they chose. 
The $100 estimated payment is subject to pro rata increase or decrease, meaning the final amount is dependent in part on how many people submitted a claim. The $6.3 million in the settlement fund will be dispensed first to medical monitoring costs, then documented loss payments and finally the flat payment recipients. 
The settlement fund has other costs to absorb as well: up to $2.1 million can go toward attorney and legal fees, and the class representatives — the seven named plaintiffs in the lawsuit — are eligible for up to $2,500 each.
A Dec. 15 filing — the plaintiffs’ motion for final approval — relayed additional details about what transpired between claim forms going out in late November and last week’s deadline to submit. 
The filing noted that Kroll used address tracing to re-mail notices for some class members, and that the firm’s expected success rate in reaching affected people “far exceed[ed] the Federal Judicial Center’s standard of 70-95%.”
As of Dec. 8, 2025, Kroll reported that it had received 15,522 claim forms. The company also received 399 calls to the toll-free line, it reported a day later.
“Class Counsel are pleased with the current Settlement class participation rate,” the document reads. “With a month left before the Claim Form Deadline, Class Counsel anticipate the number of Claims will continue to increase.”
From the Dec. 8 data to the Jan. 14 deadline, claims more than tripled, rising roughly 204%.
Patrick M. Passarella, senior director at Kroll, reported in Thursday’s filing that by the opt-out and objection deadline of Dec. 30, there were no objections and 35 opt-outs. He also noted that the response from 47,140 people, or 6.5% of the total amount of people who received mailers, was significantly higher than what is typically seen in data breach settlements.
The settlement is expected to receive final approval next Thursday, on Jan. 29, at U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island in Providence.  
An attorney for the plaintiffs did not respond to a request for comment by press time Thursday.

Janet Mills and U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree participate in a round table event on Nov. 24, 2025. (Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills and U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine, both Democrats, are demanding the Trump administration provide a detailed accounting of immigration arrests in Maine. 
After Mills called for arrest numbers, warrants and basic information about who is being detained during a Portland City Hall press conference on Thursday, Pingree followed suit with an open letter to U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. 
“Referring to human beings as something to be caught in a net reflects a disturbing disregard for human dignity and reinforces the perception that this operation was designed to intimidate and degrade rather than to uphold the law responsibly,” Pingree said.
DHS announced its heightened presence in the state on Tuesday, calling it “Operation Catch of the Day” and telling Fox News that it had arrested nearly 50 people on the first day. However, DHS has only released an incomplete list of 13 names and hasn’t shared any updated figures since. 
Mills and Maine’s congressional delegation, including Pingree, have said they haven’t been provided any information about the operation. “You know in America, we don’t believe in secret arrests or secret police,” Mills said during the press conference. “It’s one of the foundations of our country and our Constitution.”
Immigrants advised to shelter in place as feds confirm launch of Maine operation

Ruben Torres, advocacy and policy manager for the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition, which runs the community ICE watch hotline, said most calls reporting federal agent action are still coming from the Greater Portland area but have also fanned out to places such as Bangor, Augusta, Bethel and New Gloucester. 
“We’re preparing for long-term service support,” Torres said, explaining that the coalition and its partners have been meeting regularly to strategize more ways to help, including offering rides and dropping off meals.

Using some back of the napkin math, Torres explained that with ICE claiming it has 1,400 targets and reporting 50 arrests on day one, it would take at least 28 days to reach its goal keeping that pace. 
“We don’t know when this is going to end,” Torres said.
During a press conference Thursday, independent Sen. Angus King echoed the call for transparency. “ICE owes us some information,” King said, “They’ve said there are 1400 targets in Maine, we’d like to know the nature of those targets. What crimes are they charged with?”
In her letter, Pingree similarly demanded “a full and detailed accounting of the legal basis for arrests,” including who agents detained and why, where they were taken, and whether their due process rights are being protected.
“While Congress has given the Department of Homeland Security the authority to enforce federal immigration law, that authority is neither unlimited nor exempt from oversight,” Pingree wrote. “Enforcement actions that result in hundreds of individuals being abducted, serious and numerous apparent violations of due process rights, and widespread fear in immigrant communities require immediate, forthright answers.”
Pingree also expressed concern about bystanders being threatened by ICE agents. In one instance, agents drove to the home of a resident who was recording an operation and threatened her.
“This, yet again, suggests your operation was never intended to be a targeted enforcement activity, but rather an attempt to sow confusion, disrupt daily life, and create a pervasive atmosphere of cruelty,” she said.
Pingree’s House colleague, Rep. Jared Golden, put out a statement saying while federal law enforcement agencies “have the right and responsibility to enforce federal laws, including immigration laws,” DHS “should prioritize its enforcement actions on public safety and must themselves comply with federal laws.”
“Immigrants with legal status should not be targeted, court authorities should be obeyed and due process must be followed,” he said.
Republican Sen. Susan Collins has said she’s supportive of the operation so long as it is focused on people who have engaged in criminal activity. 
Meanwhile, state Republicans are calling for Democratic leaders to tone down their anti-ICE rhetoric, warning that if officials continue to suggest federal agents aren’t legitimate that it could lead to violence. 
In a radio address, Assistant House Minority Leader Katrina Smith (R-Palermo) called for a meeting with Mills. 
“We need to sit down together and talk — not past each other — about how Maine moves forward,” Smith said. “Leadership means lowering the temperature, not raising it.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_1327-scaled-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-22 18:56:28.183244

The Blue Coats finished their six game road trip on Monday with a loss to the Noblesville Boom, finishing their longest road trip of the season by going 2-4. 
 
The Delaware Blue Coats wrapped up their six game road trip, losing to the Noblesville Boom, 127-112, Monday night. 
The Boom swept the two game series that started with a 126-102 victory on Sunday, January 18, and concluded with Monday’s loss. Boom forwards Jalen Slawson and Gabe McGlothan were a big part of the team’s win on Sunday, registering a pair of double-doubles in the win (Slawson 28 points, 10 rebounds and McGlothan 16 points, 12 rebounds). 2025 second round pick and Marquette star, Kam Jones, was the catalyst in the Boom’s 15-point victory Monday night. Jones — on assignment from the Pacers — played 33 minutes and scored a team-high 23 points on 56% from the field in his first game action for the Boom this season. 
The Blue Coats were led on the offensive end by former first round draft pick, MarJon Beauchamp. Beauchamp played in seven games for the Blue Coats this season before being signed to a two-way contract by the Blue Coats NBA affiliate — the Philadelphia 76ers — on December 26. Since then, Beauchamp is averaging over 24 points per game and scored under 20 points just once during that stretch. 
The former Buck, Clipper and Knick scored 52 points across Delaware’s two games against the Boom shooting at a 42% clip, but as a whole the Blue Coats struggled on the offensive end. Delaware turned the ball over a combined 37 times and as a team shot under 50% in both games.
The team did get a minor boost in the first game of their series against the Boom when the 76ers assigned former 16th overall pick Jared McCain to the roster. McCain scored 15 points in his third game for the Blue Coats, but was recalled back to Philadelphia before the game Monday. 
The former Duke guard has been assigned to the G League multiple times this season following a strong start to his rookie season a year ago. That season was cut short due to a knee injury and with the emergence of rookie guard VJ Edgecombe, its been hard for McCain to find playing time with the NBA team averaging a little under 17 minutes per game this season.
In addition to another possible G League stint for McCain, the Blue Coat roster could evolve in the near future. The 76ers have two Blue Coat players on their roster that are nearing the end of their time with the NBA club. 
Forwards Dominick Barlow and Jabari Walker have yet to step foot on a G League court this season. Barlow and Walker are both on two-way contracts like Beauchamp, meaning they can be active up to 50 games with the NBA team before having to either be sent back to the G League or signed to a standard NBA contract. Barlow has played in 32 games for the Sixers this season while Walker has appeared in 40, but has been active in 42. If Walker were to be active for Philadelphia’s next eight games, a decision would have to be made on his future following its February 3 matchup against the Golden State Warriors. 
A decision could actually come sooner though, due to the NBA’s under-15 rule. According to Spotrac contributor and NBA reporter Keith Smith via an X post, Barlow and Walker can only be active for the same game two more times before the under-15 rule bars them from being active any longer. 
Both players have made strong contributions to the Sixers this season. Barlow is averaging a little under 25 minutes a game and has started in 29 of his 32 games played. Walker is averaging a shade under 13 minutes a game with six starts this season. The 76ers are expected to convert both players to standard contracts, according to an article published by Sports Illustrated, but if they aren’t it could mean they both return to the Blue Coats at some point this season.

Barlow and Walker’s return — while unlikely — would provide a strong boost for the 6-7 squad. The Blue Coats are last in the G League allowing over 125 points per game to their opponents during the regular season. Delaware has the third highest defensive rating as well allowing a league high 63.5 points in the paint to its opponents. 
Despite the defensive struggles, the Delaware offense is playing well averaging over 121 points per game during the regular season. The Blue Coats lead the league with 46.6 shots made per game and rank in the top ten in field goal percentage. Beauchamp’s production is a big part of the offensive performance ranking seventh in the league in scoring. 
The Blue Coats have one game at home coming up this Saturday, January 24, before ending the month with a road game against the Valley Suns on the 30th. 
Delaware will finish the series with the Valley Suns at the start of February before returning home for a long home stand with a slight interruption for the NBA All-Star break and the G League’s Next Up Game, taking place during the festivities.

In a contested hearing on Thursday afternoon, attorneys for Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield pointed to a filing in district court asking the courts to stop the hearing and process. BCBS also objected to the hearing because it said the office wasn’t properly conducting the hearing, objected that staff attorneys were advising hearing officer David Saunders, who serves as the CSI chief of staff, and said the office was unfairly targeting it, when other companies fell victim to the same breach.
The case stems from a massive data breach by Conduent, which is a third-party vendor to BCBS. In testimony Thursday, exhibits showed that Conduent discovered the breach on Jan. 13, 2025, and notified BCBS on Jan. 17, 2025.
But attorneys for Blue Cross-Blue Shield said it wasn’t until July the company discovered its data — including customer identification — had been breached.
Staff from Commissioner James Brown’s office said BCBS didn’t notify them until Oct. 8, and didn’t begin contacting customers about the breach until Oct. 24, and may have still be informing customers as late as last week.
However, attorneys from BCBS argued they had taken responsibility by informing the insurance commissioner of the breach, and for following through with customers.
But the main issue is the gap in timing, which CSI staff have said was not “reasonable.” Montana law requires insurance companies to notify the state if there is a data breach in a “reasonable” amount of time, but the exact definition of reasonable is not detailed in law.
Deputy Insurance Commissioner Erin Snyder told the hearing examiner it was her estimation a gap of months was not reasonable.
Meanwhile, Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield questioned Snyder about if the office is investigating the Conduent data breach for other companies. Snyder replied the office is investigating the matter, but has not taken any disciplinary action or hearings, as in the case of BCBS.
When counsel for the insurance giant asked why staff were not investigating the other four entities, she replied, “Because it concerns about 200 people.”
The Blue Cross-Blue Shield data breach, on the other hand, affected 462,356 people, and officials there said that personal information, including name, address and Social Security numbers may have been breached. Officials from the CSI office say because of the scope of the breach, affecting approximately one-in-three state residents, they’ve been working to restore data security and monitor identity theft.
After learning of the data breach, CSI set up an artificial intelligence tool on its website to triage the concerns because of such a large number, compared to the handful of CSI staff. Officials said that cost approximately $10,000 to establish the AI assistant.
CSI also alleges that it has not received a final report, required by law, that outlines the full scope of the breach. Furthermore, officials have not been fully briefed.
“It still has not been disclosed to this agency how it happened,” Snyder said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2226205524-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-22 18:56:28.183244

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Lawmakers advanced a bill Thursday for dispensing hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin without a prescription after medical professionals and advocates spoke on the proposal at a House subcommittee meeting Thursday.
House File 2056 would require the state medical director to establish a standing order for the dispensing of hydroxychloroquine, a prescription drug typically used in treating malaria and managing autoimmune diseases, and ivermectin, typically used to treat parasitic infections. 
Both drugs, approved for certain human uses in specific settings, became the focal point of debates following the coronavirus pandemic as some sources claimed these drugs could be used to prevent or treat symptoms COVID-19. While certain initial research showed a correlation between these drugs and positive outcomes for COVID-19 health care, further studies have not found either drug to be effective in preventing the spread or alleviating the severity of symptoms of COVID.

The proposal would require a pharmacist to dispense these two drugs to patients age 18 or older at their request, and could not require the patient to have a prescription from a medical practitioner or to schedule an appointment prior to dispensing the drug — nor could a pharmacist maintain a record of their encounter with a patient requesting  hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin.
While the bill states pharmacists dispensing these drugs under the standing order would be immune from criminal and civil liabilities for any damages caused by the dispensing or use of these drugs, medical advocates opposed the bill, saying the measure would require them to give these drugs to patients — even when they know the patient could suffer adverse side effects or have negative reactions due to interactions with other prescriptions.
Wes Pilkington, the owner of Evans Crossing Pharmacy and president of the Iowa Pharmacy Association, said the bill’s language stating, “notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a pharmacist shall dispense” these drugs was particularly concerning.
“The phrase ‘shall dispense’ removes professional judgment at the very point where pharmacists are legally and ethically obligated to evaluate patient safety,” Pilkington said. “Pharmacists are not vending machines. We are licensed health care professionals whose role is to ensure medications are safe and appropriate before they reach the patient.”
These two drugs in particular carry many potential risks for consumers, Pilkington said. Patients taking ivermectin are at risk of severe skin reactions, drops in blood pressure, central nervous system depression and neurotoxicity, he said, and risks are increased when people take increased dosages of the drug.
Hydroxychloroquine “presents even more significant concerns,” Pilkington said, as the drug presents risks of overdose and can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypoglycemia, blood disorders, irreversible retinal damage, lung disease, acute liver failure and kidney injury, especially among elderly patients.
The drug has enough risks that patients taking the medication as prescribed regularly require routine eye exams, periodic blood counts, monitoring for heart toxicity and kidney function, as well as muscle strength and reflex testing, he said. By not allowing pharmacists to practice clinical judgment in dispensing these drugs, Pilkington said the bill raises “critical unanswered questions.”
“What prevents a patient from following high dose recommendations found online and obtaining repeated prescriptions,” he said. “What stops them from visiting multiple pharmacies or obtaining a new prescription every week or every month? What happens when an elderly patient with known cardiac or kidney disease (requests) one of these medications, and I know that medication will cause them harm? This bill states that pharmacists would carry no legal liability for patient harm, but legal immunity does not erase our moral and professional responsibility to protect patients.”
Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, who is running for governor, said other medicines currently available for purchase without a prescription also have side effects.
“I mean, just the ones that we all know about, Tylenol, ibuprofen, they have a long laundry list of side effects, from liver (problems) to … asthma, to blood pressure to cardiovascular risk, to stomach and GI issues,” Andrews asked. “What separates this one, and why are those okay?”
Medical professionals and pharmacists at the meeting said the rate of developing adverse side effects — and the severity and risk of those side effects, like cardiac arrhythmias caused by hydroxychloroquine — are far higher than other drugs currently available over the counter.
Lindsay Maher with the group Informed Choice Iowa, said several states have passed laws allowing over-the-counter dispensing of ivermectin and claimed “research continues worldwide to uncover the various diseases that ivermectin is capable of treating. She also said as ivermectin has “established efficacy” for proven uses — largely regarding parasitic infections — that requiring doctor’s visits and prescriptions to access the drug “adds unnecessary burdens and delays treatments and could increase costs by not allowing these things to be over-the-counter.”
“It has serious side effects. That is true. A lot of things do. They are … abundantly rare, though, in standard human doses,” Maher said.
She also pointed to language in the bill requiring the manufacturer’s label be included in the product, meaning patients can evaluate the “full safety profile” of the drug themselves.
Rep. Austin Baeth, D-Des Moines, an internal medicine physician, said the bill was “mandated medical malpractice.”
“This bill is a group of politicians forcing a medical director to commit malpractice, and then forcing pharmacists to commit malpractice when a pharmacist is forced to give that drug when they know it might be harming that patient,” Baeth said. “Think of the ethical and moral situation of these pharmacists, when they know this patient might have Long QT syndrome or (there’s) a drug that they’re already taking that might interact with ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine. And yet, because this group of politicians in this Capitol is forcing them to give it to that patient, that pharmacist has to harm them against the oath that they took.”
Rep. Brett Barker, R-Nevada, said he also had “strong concerns about the bill as written.” He said he believes pharmacists have a responsibility “to ensure the safety and appropriateness of every prescription that they provide to a patient,” and that the bill’s requirement that pharmacists “shall dispense” these drugs even if it goes against their professional judgement was a problem.
He also said he believed the measure could set a “dangerous precedent,” saying the measure would conflict with other bills supported by Republicans in previous sessions on issues like medical conscience, or could create problems if pharmacists were required to dispense abortion drugs.
While Barker did not sign off on the bill at the subcommittee meeting, he signed off on the measure later Thursday with a recommendation for amendment. Andrews said he believes concerns about the current language can be addressed during the amendment process for the bill.
The measure moves to the House Health and Human Services Committee for further consideration.

The bill is under consideration in the Kansas House. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of Kansas Legislature video)TOPEKA — Scott Allen believes viability of Kansas racetracks would be improved with a state law granting limited civil immunity from noise or nuisance lawsuits filed by neighboring property owners who came along after establishment of a racing facility.
Allen, who serves as general manager of 81 Speedway in Park City and the Humboldt Speedway, told House Transportation Committee members Thursday that longstanding tracks shouldn’t be financially undercut by newcomers who disliked their proximity to high-decibel vehicles on dragstrips or circular tracks. He endorsed House Bill 2416, which would provide protection from civil actions based on “nuisance, taking or similar legal theories.”
“I think this is a great bill. May need a little tweak,” he said. “This would be a good fit to help protect our investments that were made in these communities.”
Rep. Leo Delperdang, R-Wichita, introduced the legislation, which was titled the Kansas Motorsports Venue Protection Act. No one spoke in opposition to the measure at the committee hearing, but several suggestions were made to amend the legislation. The committee took no votes on the bill.
Delperdang said the bill was designed to protect the rights of racetrack owners. The immunity could be invoked by a racing facility if it had been constructed before a building owned by a complainant, he said.
“It has to do with housing built around existing tracks only,” he said. “If the houses are there first, that’s a different story.”
The legislation wouldn’t provide immunity to a civil action alleging a violation of state or local laws or a circumstance prohibited by a permit issued to operators of a racing facility.
Delperdang said the bill might need to be altered to address racing facilities that had been shuttered for several years but were built before neighboring homes or businesses.
Victor Munoz, a lobbyist with Specialty Equipment Marketing Association and Performance Racing Industry said the Kansas bill was part of an effort in Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and other states to replicate an Iowa law providing immunity for racing facility owners under pressure from urban sprawl.
“This can happen very rapidly. Not because they operated unlawfully, but because development moves closer to the tracks,” Munoz said.
Munoz said older tracks faced lawsuits from newer neighbors or investors in nonracing building projects. The conflicts created legal uncertainty for track operators that could be resolved with adoption of “right to race” legislation, he said. He said the idea was to shield racetracks that were there first from claims made by noise-averse neighbors.
No mention was made during the Kansas committee hearing about whether existing businesses or homeowners could likewise gain protection from new motorsports developers.
Cindy Bell, operations manager for Kansas International Dragway, said the track near Maize opened in 1963 on isolated rural property. She said her records indicated every member of the House Transportation Committee had a constituent who raced at Dragway.
She said Kansas tracks could benefit from the type of state immunity law granted to Kansas firearms ranges that created noise problems for surrounding landowners.
“This is something the state has already set a precedent on,” she said. “We’re already protecting shooting ranges. We should look at this as well.”
She said people who moved into a house or business close to a racetrack — at least 20 operate in Kansas — should have taken notice of potential noise issues prior to purchase. However, she said, a $2.7 million home has been built about 500 feet from the Dragway track.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/John-Allen-race-track-owner.png,,,2026-01-22 18:37:40.332111

There are a host of historic fixtures adorning the Vermont Senate chamber, far from the least of which are the black leather chairs stationed behind each senator’s desk. But for the legislative pages tasked with attending to lawmakers’ needs during floor sessions, the seating has long been less luxurious: small, wooden stools with no backs and scant cushioning.
“If there had been any padding — like, ever — it was gone by the time I got on it,” said Braeden Schuren Burns, a Montpelier High School ninth-grader who worked as a page last year.
Schuren Burns was leaving the Senate one day when he wondered aloud whether the stools, which are historic in their own right, could get an upgrade. Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, overheard him, Schuren Burns said. Much to the student’s surprise, the pro tem struck up a conversation and then decided to take on the cause.
Baruth had Schuren Burns testify about his seating experience before the Senate Rules Committee, after which the panel voted, unanimously, to have the stools replaced.
The result? “You will notice they are sitting in chairs,” Baruth said on the first day of the 2026 session earlier this month, referring to the two pages seated in the chamber that day. 
The chairs, which have thick, red cushions and tall backs, were previously situated around a table in the lieutenant governor’s office, according to State Curator David Schutz. They’re not exactly of the same style as the rest of the 1859 chamber, he said, but do a good enough job fitting in. The color of the cushions, for instance, matches red details in the room’s carpet.
Baruth said that while the chairs will be in place during the session, Statehouse staff may swap the old stools back in once the Legislature adjourns for the year. Lest tourists get the wrong idea: The Senate has long made middle-schoolers suffer in the name of historic preservation.
In fact, Schuren Burns isn’t the first to raise the issue in the roughly 100 years that teens have served as pages. Senate Secretary John Bloomer’s office directed VTDigger to a 1969 joint House and Senate resolution proposing, per legislative records, to “study the need for cushions for the pages’ stools.”
“Whereas they are less well padded against discomfort than their elders, and whereas, their discomfort leaves them sorely aggrieved,” it reads, the Sergeant-at-Arms ought to work with leadership to find “a method of alleviating the plight” of the building’s youngest staffers.
It only gets better from there. The House and Senate ended up sending the resolution to a conference committee, which settled on new language stating “that a proper package deal of broken resolves, green schist, talc, and stuffed shirts, encased in Morgan horse hide, be applied to the hardwood stools,” as well as “that the stools be painted a Pavilion brick color.”
“And be it further resolved,” the measure continues, “that the cost of these refinements be footed from the general fund surplus expected from the sales tax or the lieutenant governor’s slush fund, whichever is the greater.”
That Senate in 1969 deadlocked on a vote to approve the conference committee’s report, which, to be sure, seems like it was more of a civics education effort for the pages than anything real. Regardless, procedures played out; and in a tie-breaking vote, the LG shot the plan down. 
No doubt he was protecting his secret stash — at the expense, of course, of pages’ comfort for decades to come.

In the know
“All roads lead to the Northeast Kingdom,” at least according to U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., who stood before a packed Cedar Creek room this afternoon to rally support during the region’s Statehouse takeover day. On either side of the lunchtime rally, local advocates, elected officials and NEK residents testified on a range of issues that hit close to home. 
Welch was joined by State Treasurer Mike Pieciak; Rep. Michael Marcotte, R-Coventry; Rep. Leanne Harple, D-Glover; and fellow Glover resident Lt. Gov. John Rodgers in summing up the matters most pressing to NEK residents: how to attract and keep young people in the area, how to build affordable houses that allow people to own a patch of land and how to support farmers who rely on marketplace health insurance and have recently lost the enhanced subsidies that helped keep plans affordable.  
But the biggest applause of the day went to Harple, in her plea to keep small schools small: “A small school isn’t a failed school. A rural school isn’t a business mistake,” she said. “We can’t legislate away geography. We can’t consolidate rural life, and we can’t remap Vermont into being something it’s not.”

Vermont Education Secretary Zoie Saunders on Thursday presented lawmakers a proposal to “modernize and enhance” the state’s career and technical education system by establishing a single regional governance entity to oversee its delivery.
Saunders addressed lawmakers during a joint meeting of the House Education Committee and the House Commerce and Economic Development Committee, as well as the Senate Committee on Economic Development, Housing, and General Affairs.
Currently, career and technical education centers in Vermont serve around 5,000 students, but most centers have long wait lists.
There are 17 career and technical education centers, with four varying governance models overseeing them, according to Ruth Durkee, state director of career and technical education.
Saunders said this “makes the overall system more complex.” Students’ access to career and technical education centers, meanwhile, is often limited by their proximity to a center. 
The testimony offered some insight into Saunders’ thinking for the future state of public education as lawmakers and officials this session work toward the reform envisioned by Act 73.
The regional agency overseeing career and technical education would “be that bridge until we, as a state, get to the future where we have regional comprehensive high schools, where all students are enrolled in a high school, co-located with the CTE center and all of that programming is seamlessly delivered,” she said.
In these regional high schools, students would be offered “blended pathways” to both career and technical education opportunities as well as traditional learning.
“The idea here is to make sure that it’s not a separate option, that CTE is infused in how we develop and design our education programming across the state,” she told lawmakers.

On the move
“Public trust is key, right?” said Jeffrey Amestoy, former chief justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. 
Amestoy, also a former Vermont attorney general, authored the majority opinion in the 1999 state Supreme Court ruling that found the state had no legal basis to discriminate against same sex couples. That lawsuit later led lawmakers to legalize civil unions for same sex couples.  
He’s no stranger to controversy and political backlash — and Thursday he encouraged senators in the Judiciary Committee to remain apolitical and look at the qualifications of Christina Nolan and Michael Drescher, the governor’s two recent nominees for the state Supreme Court, when considering them for confirmation. Both nominees previously served as the top federal prosecutor in Vermont under President Trump.
Baruth asked Amestoy: “Is there a difference in attitude that justices need to bring?”
Judges always need to be sensitive to the times they’re living in, Amestoy said. But he emphasized that a candidate’s integrity and qualifications may say more about their ability to uphold Vermont values than their political background. 
Sen. Welch called both candidates “really solid attorneys” during a press scrum in the card room Thursday. 
He condemns prosecution on behalf of Trump that is politically motivated, he said. “But I have not heard anything suggesting that either of them were involved in anything related to a political motivation,” Welch said.

From Davos, with love
Did you have ‘Vermont mentioned at Davos’ on your 2026 bingo card? Me neither. 
JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, arguably the world’s most influential banker, used his bully pulpit at the World Economic Forum Wednesday to criticize President Trump’s idea to cap credit card interest rates at 10%. And he threw in a cheeky nod to the Green Mountain State.
Dimon warned Trump’s idea would cut off many Americans from accessing credit, Reuters reported. 
Per Reuters: “I think we should test it,” Dimon said. “The government can do it, they should force all the banks to do it in two states — Vermont and Massachusetts — and see what happens.”

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)State senators voted against discussions on banning hemp-derived consumables and kratom on Thursday at the South Dakota Capitol in Pierre. 
Separate bills to ban the use, possession, sale or consumption of those intoxicating substances advanced out of a Senate committee on Wednesday, but the committee voted to send them to the Senate floor with no recommendation, rather than a recommendation to pass them.
By Senate rules, bills that land on the full chamber’s calendar without a recommendation need the support of a majority of senators before they’re eligible for a debate, and ultimately for a vote.
Panel sends bills to ban kratom and hemp-derived consumables to Senate floor

Sen. Kevin Jensen, R-Canton, moved to put the bills on the Senate’s calendar for Monday. He said both bills had drawn spirited debate and survived attempts by some committee members to defeat them.
On the bill to ban hemp-derived intoxicants for anyone without a medical marijuana card, Senate Bill 61, Jensen said there are amendments in the works to address its opponents’ concerns.
He offered similar comments, without referencing possible amendments, when he moved to place Senate Bill 77’s ban on kratom products on the Senate calendar.
“It’s a very important bill,” Jensen said.
Sen. John Carley, R-Piedmont, the prime sponsor of the bills, pointed out that all members of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee had voted to send the bills “to the floor to be considered.”
Both moves failed. Senators voted down a debate for the hemp product prohibitions 19-14, with one member excused, and said no to a kratom debate on a vote of 20-13.

Rand Paul, left, and House Speaker David Osborne, right, speak during a press conference. (Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)FRANKFORT — U.S. Sen. Rand Paul said the country needs more nuclear reactors, reiterated his support for hemp products and indicated taking over Greenland wasn’t on his to-do list in a wide-ranging conversation with reporters Thursday afternoon.
Paul, a Kentucky Republican, met with reporters after having spent time with GOP state lawmakers in the Capitol annex. He was joined by House Speaker David Osborne, R-Prospect, who said they had just finished a joint meeting of the House and Senate Republican caucuses. The GOP has a supermajority in both chambers.  
With the upcoming election for outgoing Kentucky Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell’s seat, Paul is poised to become the next senior senator of the state. His term ends in 2029. However, he didn’t immediately rule out a future presidential run when asked and said he would make a decision after this year. He ended his 2016 bid for the White House after the Iowa caucuses. 
“When I did try in 2016, we did a presidential caucus, and I don’t think there were a lot of complaints,” the senator said. “That’s a bridge we will cross after 2026.” 
AI and nuclear energy
At the state level, Kentucky Republicans have focused on artificial intelligence policies in recent years. A task force on the topic has met over the past two years in order to work on potential legislation. 
Asked how federal decisions on AI could impact state policies, Paul said that he thinks “a lot of these decisions will be made by the state legislature.” He said one lawmaker asked about the issue in the meeting before the press conference. 
“I think if you’re in a crowded area, a suburb of a big town, you say, ‘I may not want a whole power grid and a data center here,’” Paul said. “If you live in a rural community that really is hungry for jobs and needs population, you might want one.” 
Paul also sees it as an energy issue, adding that while he supports coal production, nuclear power “is a reasonable thing” to add to the mix. More energy is needed to support data centers that use AI, he said. 
“You can’t just have data centers without energy, so we’re going to need more energy,” the senator said. “And it’s one of those things where I may weigh in with an opinion, but ultimately, most of that will be decided here.” 
Paul said he had been working with this staff to “get rid of regulations that are inhibiting nuclear power” at the federal level. 
“France is like 70-80% nuclear power, so there is no reason we can’t do a lot more,” he added. “And those who are concerned about the environment, there’s probably nothing cleaner than nuclear that can produce that much energy — versus solar, wind and water, clean — but none of them can produce energy that nuclear power can, so I think we need to add that to our armamentarium.” 
Epstein files
Paul is an ally of U.S. Rep. Massie, another Kentucky Republican, who led the charge to release the files on the federal investigation into late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffery Epstein. Paul said he was in favor of releasing the files “for transparency.” 
However, he did say that while the Trump administration has not released all the files, “one concern in the slowness, is trying to make sure they don’t either release victims names or people falsely accused,” which can be “a difficult process.”
Hemp ban
Over the past year, Paul and McConnell have sparred over new regulations to prevent the sale of some intoxicating hemp-based or hemp derived products online, in gas stations and corner stores. They are expected to go into effect this November. Paul had opposed the changes, but recently filed legislation with two Democratic senators, U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, to delay the prohibition by two years. 
Paul called the restrictions “an insult to the state legislature.” He praised Kentucky lawmakers in particular for having “spent a lot of time on the issue and came up with a regulatory framework.” Last year, Kentucky lawmakers passed a law to ban the sale of hemp-derived beverages until this summer. 
“I think states that have taken the time to regulate it, the state regulation should supersede the federal, so I’ve introduced legislation to have a federal law that says if a state like Kentucky has put in a regulatory framework for hemp, that would actually override the federal ban,” Paul said. 
SNAP and food
The legislature’s Make America Healthy Again-Kentucky Taskforce discussed in the interim session ways to limit Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) purchases to food with higher nutritional value, like meats and vegetables. Paul has backed similar legislation at the federal level. 
“We don’t pay for alcohol. We don’t pay for cigarettes. I don’t think food stamps should pay for unhealthy food,” Paul said, adding that he views foods like candy, chips or drinks with added sugar falling into that category. 
He continued, saying that “the highest rate of obesity is among our poor population.” A 2024 study by doctors at Johns Hopkins University found that counties with greater income inequality had higher rates of obesity. 
House Speaker David Osborne, R-Prospect, who was with Paul during the press conference said that the statehouse bill  was “roughly complete,” but had not yet been filed. 
Greenland
While Trump has indicated that he’s reached a possible agreement in his quest for the U.S. to control Greenland, Paul said he was “still trying to figure that one out” when asked about his thoughts on the matter. 
“If I want to buy a horse from you, I probably wouldn’t insult you and say I’m going to come take the horse if you don’t sell it to me,” Paul said. “It’s not a good negotiating strategy.”











“If I want to buy a horse from you, I probably wouldn’t insult you and say I’m going to come take the horse if you don’t sell it to me. It’s not a good negotiating strategy.”


– U.S. Sen. Rand Paul



	Paul said that a better way to reach a deal would be to “take you to dinner. I’d probably say nice things to you. I’d probably compliment you and try to get you to negotiate a price on a horse.” 
Paul said that he’s not heard any Democrats say they are in favor of invading Greenland, as well as any Republicans. 
“It hasn’t been as vocal as I have, but I haven’t heard anybody even privately say, ‘Oh yeah, it’s a good idea to send the Marines to Greenland,” Paul said. 
Paul added that he thinks the idea “will fade,” particularly with Trump’s new deal.
“I think the new deal is going to be what we actually already have — that’s the right to put more military bases on (Greenland),” he said. 
If Greenland wanted to be sold to the U.S. and it was a reasonable price, Paul said he’d consider it, but reiterated that he’d “go about it in a different way.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5714-1024x764.jpg,,,2026-01-22 18:37:40.332111

The resolution failed on a 3-2 vote. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s (RIPTA) governing board would welcome a share of revenue from a millionaire’s tax if the state were to enact one this year. 
But the agency’s board of directors stopped short of formally endorsing Gov. Dan McKee’s proposed tax on top earners during its monthly meeting Thursday afternoon, with a 3-2 vote against a resolution drafted by its former chairman.
“This is the one way that we can fix the public transit system once and for all,” board member Normand Benoit said when introducing the resolution.
Benoit admitted he has opposed tax-the-rich policies in the past. But he said he supports McKee’s fiscal 2027 budget proposal calling for a 3% surtax on state income over $1 million. Benoit anticipated such a proposal might surface this year when the board voted Dec. 17 to submit RIPTA’s fiscal 2027 budget to McKee’s office with a $14 million deficit. 
At the time, Benoit suggested a millionaire’s tax could be a solution to raise revenue to sustain the agency.
McKee’s proposed budget released Jan. 15 would fill RIPTA’s $14 million deficit by tapping into additional highway maintenance account revenue and raising fees on cruise ship visitors landing in Newport. But it’s still not enough to restore service to what it was before last fall when RIPTA reduced service on 46 of its 67 bus lines — the most significant cuts in the agency’s 59-year history. 
The service cuts were made after McKee declined to fill a $32.6 million deficit for fiscal 2026. The General Assembly eventually propped up RIPTA with nearly $15 million in annual revenue from upping the agency’s share of the gas tax and highway maintenance fund. RIPTA administrators working with McKee’s office found other savings, but not enough to stave off service reductions.
 “Unless something dramatic takes place, we’re going to be up at the General Assembly with our tin cups asking if we can have a little bit of this or a little bit of that,” Benoit said. “And so far it hasn’t been that successful.”

The board’s chairman and Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr. cautioned against the board delving into politics, particularly on a policy he foresees being “debated heavily” on Smith Hill. 
“I’m concerned about RIPTA entering that debate prematurely,” he said. “We would be entering some unknown territory here by actively being proponents of a political viewpoint.”
But board member Patrick Crowley, the president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO who has long advocated for raising the state’s top marginal individual income tax, said the agency often weighs in on legislation that would impact its finances.
“I don’t think this is any different,” he said.
Crowley added that it would behoove the board to show solidarity with its mostly working class rider base. Survey results presented to the board in October found around 57% of riders polled had a household income less than $25,000 per year.
“The reality is it’s the working-class community that we’re serving,” he said.










Unless something dramatic takes place, we’re going to be up at the General Assembly with our tin cups asking if we can have a little bit of this or a little bit of that. And so far it hasn’t been that successful.


– Normand Benoit, member of the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s board of directors


Still, Alviti and the other opposing board members said the agency should wait until a hypothetical millionaire’s tax becomes reality. 
“While we can have subsequent deliberation, we can then suggest in our budgets as we go forward to include some of that new revenue if they decide to be allocated to transit,” Alviti said.
Joining Alviti against formally backing the millionaire’s tax were James Leach and Vincent Masino. Voting in favor of the resolution were Benoit and Crowley. 
Board members Bernard Georges, James Lombardi, Marcy Reyes, and Heather Schey were not present for Thursday’s meeting.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah leaders like to brag about the “Utah Way,” that we’re different, or “special.” U.S. News and World Report has ranked Utah the best state in the country three years in a row. But I wonder if anyone from that publication has visited Utah in the last two weeks. Because lately we have also been “number one” in the country in something far less admirable — deadly air pollution. As many as 8,000 Utahns die annually from our air pollution and it costs our economy billions.
Fixing or even acknowledging our notorious air pollution has completely fallen off Utah’s radar. The legislature’s bipartisan Clean Air Caucus has disappeared. I have not read or heard about a single clean air bill filed by the Legislature. I have not heard any lip service from any of our state leaders about air pollution in a long time, nor from our members of Congress. Rather Utah’s Capitol Hill and Washington, D.C. have become headquarters for a full-frontal assault on clean air, clean water, and environmental protection of any kind. 
Last year, EPA Director Lee Zeldin signaled right out of the gate that he would turn the Environmental Protection Agency into the Polluter Protection Agency. He broadcast that EPA’s mission would be to make it cheaper to buy cars, heat homes and run businesses. He then announced rollbacks of 31 clean air and clean water regulations to power the “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. History.”
Recently Zeldin announced EPA would simply abandon its role of regulating greenhouse gases at all, including automobile carbon emissions. This week he announced the EPA would no longer even try to quantify the human health costs of pollution or the benefits of regulations. 
The rest of the world is moving quickly toward electric vehicles to limit greenhouse gas emissions. But President Donald Trump’s EPA wants to drive a stake through the heart of that movement. Even automakers think much of this deregulatory frenzy is over the top. The Business Roundtable, an influential council of large companies which includes major polluters like 3M, General Motors, and Chevron, wrote in comments to the EPA, “Attempting to comply with multiple, likely conflicting, regulations among the states will drive up compliance costs for companies, create obstacles for investment decisions, lead to regulatory uncertainty, and make efficient reduction of emissions more difficult.” Even oil lobbyists such as the American Petroleum Institute have asked the EPA not to repeal the greenhouse gas rules for power plants. But if Trump prevails, count on more tailpipe and smokestack pollution on the Wasatch Front thanks to his infatuation with fossil fuels and the internal combustion engine. 
Gov. Spencer Cox, legislative leaders, and Utah’s congressional delegation have all remained silent about this brazen attack on your life and your health. In fact they’ve joined in on it.
In November the Trump EPA said it would reverse the tighter PM2.5 standard set by the Biden administration in 2024 and not defend the rule in court against 25 Republican-led states, including Utah, that had filed suit to stop the EPA from making our air cleaner. It’s hard for Utah’s political leaders to claim they care about clean air when they literally went to court to make it dirtier. And this was the third time Utah has done that. They appealed to the Biden EPA to allow Utahns to breathe more ozone. They act like clean air is a punishment.
The Trump administration is trying to resuscitate a dying coal industry by reopening federal lands to mining, stripping environmental reviews, subsidizing coal-fired electricity and coal exports, and ordering coal plants to stay open. But calling coal “beautiful and clean” doesn’t make it so, nor does it make it cheap. The levelized cost of electricity from new coal plants is more than double that of solar, wind and natural gas, according to Bloomberg NEF, even disregarding all the health and climate damage of burning coal. 
Meanwhile Utah’s leaders are throwing caution to wind and pollution into the air by having the Utah Inland Port Authority force-feed us all a massive network of warehouses and water-intensive data centers, paving over fragile wetlands that act as pollution sponges, and ushering in more truck and train pollution. There are bills like HB60 that will actually accelerate the collapse of the Great Salt Lake into a toxic dust bowl. 
The legislature has now convened for the 2026 general session, and with it their perennial pursuit of making Utah a family values and economic paradise. But citizens need to let them know that without clean air, Utah is just paradise lost.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/011526_Inversion_03-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-22 18:37:40.332111

Jeff Landry has issued a state of emergency and warned residents to take precautions ahead of an ice storm expected to impact parts of the state this weekend. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has issued a state of emergency and warned residents to take precautions ahead of an ice storm expected to impact parts of the state this weekend. 
The severe winter weather is expected to bring freezing temperatures, snow and ice to more than half of the United States beginning Friday and lasting into early next week. 
State Climatologist Jay Grymes said the storm will have the heaviest impacts on central and north Louisiana. In the worst case scenario, ice accumulations of half-inch or more could reach as far south as Alexandria, he said, with a very low probability of south Louisiana seeing similar conditions. 
The ice is expected to cause power outages, though state officials believe the outages would last no more than a week. 
The ability for utility companies to restore power will depend on road conditions, which could remain icy as the forecast calls for freezing temperatures into next week, state officials said. 
“I cannot say this enough: Stay off the roads,” Landry said during a news conference at the Governor’s Office for Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness. “Once you have checked on your plants, your pipes, your people, your pets, get comfortable, cook a gumbo. Please, get in your homes, get warm, get safe and stay there. Even after the event passes, the cold air is going to stay, which means that any ice accumulation will be on the roads.”
Transportation Secretary Glenn Ledet said the state is prepared with the largest stockpile of salt, brine and other de-icing materials it has ever amassed. The materials have been pre-staged around the state to combat the icy conditions. 
The state has also coordinated with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has provided generators, bottled water and ready-to-eat meals, Landry said. 
More than 30 warming centers are expected to be open, though Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein said they are locally run and will not be open overnight. 
Louisiana State Fire Marshal Bryan Adams urged Louisianians to take precautions when heating their homes, including turning off space heaters and putting out fireplaces before going to bed. Free smoke detectors can be picked up from local fire stations, and carbon monoxide detectors are currently being distributed in North Louisiana as well, Adams said.

“I don’t take it lightly that I’ll be a leader on this ticket that will help bring back and restore Democratic trifecta here in Michigan and deliver real results on affordability for Michigan families,” Benson said at the event. “I know we have that work cut out for us, but I know we can do it, because we are the party that stands for the people.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Right now, it feels far too often like government is showing up everywhere we don’t want it, and nowhere where we actually need it,” she added. “I’m going to make sure that government is showing up for the people I’ve spent my entire career fighting to make that real.”
Benson also doubled down on her support for data centers at the event, calling them “an incredible opportunity” to bring wealth and green jobs to the state.
Benson’s support for the data centers, which have become a key issue around the state, fell under scrutiny due to her husband’s role as president of a company seeking to create a data center in Washtenaw County.
“We have to do this the right way and build guardrails to ensure that we have a transparent and rigorous process in determining what data centers should come to which communities and that we also statewide, are creating and enforcing real guardrails so that, among other things, data centers have to use the most modern technology to protect against unnecessary water use and also develop partnerships to drive down energy costs and invest in clean energy transitions throughout our state,” she continued.

Benson is generally seen as a front-runner for the Democratic nomination at this point, especially following the decision of Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist to drop out of the race and run instead for Secretary of State.
Benson also snagged the endorsement earlier in the week of former U.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence, who represented a district in Southeast Michigan until 2022.
“I have had the opportunity to watch her serve in many roles, and she has proven herself to be a fierce defender of the rule of law and our election systems, with an unwavering commitment to serving all people,” Lawrence said in a press release from Benson’s campaign on Tuesday. “As we look toward the governor’s seat, I strongly urge everyone to support the leader we need at this moment in our history. Jocelyn Benson knows the people of Michigan, is willing to do the hard work, and will keep our state moving forward as a leader in the nation.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_3791-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-22 18:37:40.332111

(Getty Images)Three more counties would get a chance at landing a new Indiana casino under changes made to a bill moving in the Legislature.
Revisions adopted Thursday to House Bill 1038 added northeastern Indiana’s DeKalb and Steuben counties and Wayne County in eastern Indiana as casino contenders with Fort Wayne’s Allen County.
The original version had Allen County as the sole possible location for transfer of the casino license from the Ohio River city of Rising Sun.
The revised proposal would require the company building the new casino to spend at least $500 million on the project within five years of the doors opening to gamblers.
More relocation competition
House Public Policy Committee Chair Ethan Manning, R-Logansport, said Allen County would be the most-likely site for such an investment but that the additional counties would provide more competition.
“These counties are included because they have in one way or other, raised their hands as being interested,” Manning said. “They’ve got a significant amount of alignment within their local governments.”
Wayne and Steuben county leaders pitched their communities as attractive locations for the new casino.
Steuben County Commissioners President Wil Howard told the committee that the county in the state’s far northeastern corner would draw in gamblers from Michigan and Ohio.
“In the past month, we’ve gained a lot of ground in terms of community support and cohesion for Steuben County being included,” Howard said.
The current Rising Star Casino— owned and operated by Las Vegas-based Full House Resorts — generates the least casino tax in the state and has seen revenues plummet since casinos opened in Ohio and gambling expanded in Kentucky.
Full House has for several years sought permission to move the casino to a new location, but the revised bill would allow all operators of Indiana’s current 13 state-regulated casinos to submit proposals for the license transfer.
Rising Sun and Indianapolis considerations
A study released by the Indiana Gaming Commission in October found that Indianapolis was the top location for a casino relocation, followed by northeast Indiana.
While the Indianapolis region would bring the state more tax revenue, the study found it would also hurt the two casinos nearby in Shelbyville and Anderson that also have horse tracks and help support the horse racing industry. The Fort Wayne area was seen as more of an open market, impacting casinos in Ohio and Michigan.
Among details of the proposal:

The Indiana Gaming Commission would select the new casino operator by April 15, 2027. 
While a city mayor and board of county commissioners would need to endorse any casino proposals for a site in their communities, the bill doesn’t provide for a voter referendum on local support as many previous casino projects have required.
The company winning the project would pay a $50 million fee to the state over a five-year period.
If Full House doesn’t obtain the transferred license, the winning company would have to pay the fair market value of the Rising Star Casino as determined by an independent consultant hired by the gaming commission.

Another provision calls for the new casino’s operator to pay a total of $30 million to the city of Rising Sun and Ohio County as compensation for their lost casino tax revenue.
Rising Sun City Attorney Andrew Baudendistel said that compensation level was inadequate as the city and county have averaged about $5 million in annual casino tax revenue in recent years. He suggested the city and county receive a small percentage of the new casino’s revenue in perpetuity.
Baudendistel also said the bill should include requirements for assisting with redevelopment of the casino site “to ensure an abandoned lot and riverboat aren’t the first thing you see when entering our city.”
Some Indianapolis legislators have pushed for a downtown casino in the city, but have been rebuffed.
“That remains very difficult for me to square, based on the evidence as studies have consistently shown Indianapolis would be the most productive location for a casino,” said committee member Rep. Blake Johnson, D-Indianapolis.
Next steps in debate
The Public Policy Committee voted 9-1 in favor of the bill. The House Ways and Means Committee, which is responsible for reviewing the bill’s financial impact, must advance it by a Monday deadline for the proposal to face a full House vote.
A Senate committee in December endorsed Senate Bill 70 that would allow Full House to relocate its casino to Allen County. That bill, however, has not been taken up by the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Republican House Speaker Todd Huston said he supported the casino relocation over proposals for legalizing more online gambling.
“You’re talking about a major, hundreds of millions of dollars economic impact in northeast Indiana,” Huston told reporters Thursday. “I think that’s different than somebody playing on their phone.”

Tougaloo, a 157-year-old, private historically Black college located in north Jackson, has been on the hunt for its 15th college president for nearly a year. In June, the college’s presidential search committee held community listening sessions for faculty, alumni, board of trustees and students after hiring WittKieffer, a Chicago-based consulting firm to help lead the search. 
In a November letter addressed to constituents, Blondean Davis, chair of the presidential search committee, said the search committee received 114 applications for the role at Tougaloo. WittKieffer consultants and committee members reviewed and screened each submission before identifying 12 candidates to move to first round interviews. In December, committee members selected final candidates for the role and to schedule campus visits. 
“I’m extremely pleased with the process and think we have three highly qualified candidates,” Davis told Mississippi Today. 
In February, WitKieffer plans to gather constituents’ evaluation responses and present them in a formal report to the search committee.

Yellowstone is a dynamic geologic system—the one constant is change.  This is demonstrated daily by hydrothermal activity manifested in geysers, hot springs, mud pots, and other thermal features, but even the ground itself moves!
Surface movement, called deformation, in Yellowstone varies tremendously.  During the past century, both uplift and subsidence have occurred, sometimes alternating on an annual basis.  These changes can be driven by a variety of processes, like fault motion, accumulation or withdrawal of magma or hydrothermal fluids, and even cooling and contraction of subsurface fluids.
During 1996–2004, an area along the north caldera rim, just south of Norris Geyser Basin, uplifted by a total of about 12 centimeters (almost 5 inches).  This deformation came to be known as the Norris Uplift Anomaly (NUA), and it was thought to be a result of accumulation of magma 14 kilometers (almost 9 miles) beneath the surface.  This sort of activity is probably quite common, but it is only thanks to the technological innovations and expanded monitoring networks of the past few decades that such minor changes can be detected.
The area of the NUA subsided by about 7 centimeters (about 3 inches) for a few years after 2004, and deformation in the area was mostly flat for a decade.  Then, during 2013-2020, the ground closer to Norris Geyser Basin began to alternate between uplift and subsidence, this time due to shallow accumulation and release of water.  It is possible that the water came from the magma associated with the NUA, given that water and gases are dissolved in magma and can be released as the magma rises.  No significant changes occurred after 2020, with the possible exception of about 1 cm of uplift and subsequent subsidence of the NUA area during 2020-2022.
(Cue the deep-voiced narrator): Until now.
In July 2025, continuous GPS stations on the northwest side of Yellowstone caldera began moving away from the area of the NUA.  The change in surface displacement patterns, however, occurred at about the same time as the seasonal patterns that happen every year, so the results were initially ambiguous.
Additional data came from semi-permanent GPS stations.  These sites are installed each spring or early summer and removed in the fall.  They only record data on site, so we can’t see what the stations measured until they are recovered and the data downloaded.  Two of these sites are near the center of the NUA, and sure enough, once the data were processed it was clear that uplift began in July.  Between July and the time the stations were collected in September, the ground rose by almost 2 centimeters (less than an inch).
Meanwhile, the nearby continuous GPS sites continued to show horizontal movement away from the NUA. By the end of the year, the horizontal displacement had reached 1 centimeter (less than half an inch).
The final confirmation of the uplift was from interferometric synthetic aperture radar—InSAR.  This technique uses satellite radar images recorded at different times to detect changes in the shape of the ground.  InSAR data spanning October 2024 to October 2025 showed about 2 centimeters (less than an inch) of uplift along the north rim of the caldera.  The pattern of uplift was very similar to that of 1996–2004.
It was clear.  The NUA was back!
There was even a small increase in seismicity.  Overall, earthquake activity during 2025 was low—only 1,113 earthquakes were located, compared to typical rates of 1,500 to 2,500 earthquakes per year.  There was an uptick in earthquakes during September through December 2025, including a swarm near the NUA where more than 100 earthquakes were located, especially in November (the largest being M2.7).  It is possible that these earthquakes are a response to subtle stress changes associated with the uplift.
Is this a sign of an impending eruption, or some other hazard?  No. Rather, it is another example of Yellowstone’s dynamic nature, and what we can learn about the characteristics of the subsurface using a new generation of sensitive monitoring tools.  The current deformation is also minor in magnitude (it pales in comparison to deformation seen at other caldera systems), and before any hazardous activity the deformation rates would accelerate dramatically—something that can obviously be tracked by the continuous GPS network.
YVO will continue to monitor the deformation and report about it in monthly updates and annual reports. You can follow along too! The best way to see the NUA deformation is in the horizontal components of motion at sites P711 (which is near Madison Junction) and NRWY (near Norris Geyser Basin), and the distance change between those sites, which span the uplifting area.  A website with this information has been established at https://www.usgs.gov/observatories/yvo/science/uplift-along-north-rim-yellowstone-caldera.

,DC,2026-01-22 22:55:04+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump’s ban on transgender troops challenged in key appeals court hearing,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trumps-ban-transgender-troops-challenged-key-appeals-court-hearing,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s ban on transgender troops came under scrutiny again in federal court Thursday — this time before a three-judge appeals panel considering the merits of the president’s executive order.The policy has been challenged in two major federal cases, one of which the administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court’s emergency docket. In May, the justices allowed the ban to go into effect while the lawsuits continue in the lower courts.For just over three hours at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, judges pressed the Trump administration and the lawyer for the plaintiffs in Talbott v. Trump for clarity on the ban instituted just under one year ago.The panel was made up of Judges Judith W. Rogers, appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1994; Robert L. Wilkins, appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014; and Justin R. Walker, a 2019 Trump appointee.U.S. Deputy Associate Attorney General Abhishek Kambli, arguing for the administration, told the judges the ban in question rests on the findings and policy of former Secretary of Defense James Mattis. “The Mattis report does provide the rationale,” Kambli said, when pressed by Wilkins on why “people who’ve been in (service) for years, with Bronze Stars and commendations” are swept up in the policy.“What we have here is an area of medicine, which we can all agree there’s uncertainty over,” Kambli argued.Mattis, who served during Trump’s first term, disqualified transgender service members from the military, except in very narrow circumstances. A February 2022 Defense Department report concluded that transgender service members, even members who are not suffering a gender dysphoria diagnosis, “could undermine readiness, disrupt unit cohesion, and impose an unreasonable burden on the military.”Kambli, moments later, added the courts are “ill equipped” to decide the issue and should show deference to the military.But Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for LGBTQ Rights, said Kambli and the Trump administration ignored new information revealed after President Joe Biden reversed the Mattis ban and allowed transgender troops to serve openly.Minter, who argued in court for the plaintiffs, said there was “zero evidence of any problems. … That is part of the record now.”“So for someone to come in and just go back to keeping people out … this is based on animus,” Minter said.The government “has to show there is a legitimate purpose,” Minter said.Process for discharging trans troops debatedKambli told the judges that “so far no one has been discharged” and the policy is still “in progress.”The transgender service members would be informed via letter of an honorable discharge, and would have the opportunity to go before a three-officer administrative discharge panel, he said. The special panel process is usually reserved for members who’ve served six or more years, but the military will make an exception for trans members with less than six years of service, Kambli added.  In an animated exchange, Rogers pressed back: “The end result is predetermined. It’s a meaningless process. It’s just moving paper around.”Jennifer Levi, senior director for GLAD Law, one of the organizations representing the roughly 30 plaintiffs, told States Newsroom after the arguments that trans members have already been “forced out” through a voluntary process.“This was an important hearing, and the plaintiffs in this case are all meeting military standards and reflect some of the highest ideals of this country. They've committed their lives to service, and the military has conceded that they have been able to contribute and meet all of the rigorous standards for service,” Levi said.“This hearing brought out just how devastating and harmful it is to purge a group of people who have been contributing and putting their lives on the line in service of the country.”The Pentagon declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation.Trump orderTrump signed the order on Jan. 27, 2025, asserting the “adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.” Further, the order said that being transgender is “not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.”Eight active-duty service members and transgender individuals who are actively pursuing enlistment in the armed forces initially brought the case against Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, among other officials and three branches of the U.S. military. The number of plaintiffs has since grown.U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia Ana Reyes granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction in mid-March, criticizing the administration in her 79-page opinion for a lack of data proving the claims in Trump’s order.“Transgender persons have served openly since 2021, but Defendants have not analyzed their service. That is unfortunate. Plaintiffs’ service records alone are Exhibit A for the proposition that transgender persons can have the warrior ethos, physical and mental health, selflessness, honor, integrity, and discipline to ensure military excellence,” Reyes wrote.Administration officials swiftly appealed the case to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Oral arguments were heard April 22 before Judges  Cornelia Pillard, appointed during Obama’s second term, and Neomi Rao and Gregory Katsas, both appointed during Trump’s first term.On Dec. 9, the three judges issued a 2-1 decision staying the lower court’s preliminary injunction, with Katsas and Rao writing the Hegseth policy “likely does not violate equal protection.” Pillard issued a blistering dissent, asserting the ban “brands all transgender people, without regard to individual merit, as unworthy to serve in our armed forces solely because they are transgender.”In a separate case, Shilling, et al v. Trump, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on April 18 upheld a lower court’s ruling that allowed transgender troops to continue serving, denying the government’s appeal. In May, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Trump to ban transgender people from the military.",,,,2026-01-22 17:56:25.284073

(Photo courtesy of Legislative Support Services)Republican state Sen. Matt Boehnke announced Thursday he is forgoing reelection and entering this year’s race to succeed retiring Republican Congressman Dan Newhouse in central Washington.
And he wasted little time criticizing what he views as the performative politics of the two prominent Republicans, Jerrod Sessler and Amanda McKinney, also vying to take the reins from Newhouse in the 4th Congressional District.
“Residents want common sense leadership, they want a statesman that governs by listening to the people and wants to hear the concerns of all,” Boehnke said, referring to his approach. “They are looking for clicks on social media. They are running for the wrong reasons and not for the people.”
Boehnke, 57, of Kennewick, is in his first term representing the 8th Legislative District after serving four years in the House. He is a former Kennewick City Council member and served 22 years in the U.S. Army.
He described himself as a fiscal conservative who will “fight for America First ideas,” promote the district’s economic drivers like agriculture, aerospace and energy, and work to establish the region as a leader in the artificial intelligence sector.
Boehnke is a moderating voice in the Senate Republican Caucus. That, he said, will likely be a source of criticism from within the GOP.
“They’ll say I’m not Republican enough. I don’t scream on social media enough,” he said.
President Donald Trump has endorsed his opponents – McKinney most recently and Sessler in the 2024 election. 
McKinney, a Yakima County commissioner, has also been endorsed by House Speaker Mike Johnson, along with Turning Point Action, the national conservative organization founded by the late Charlie Kirk.
Sessler, a business owner, has run for the seat twice. He lost in the primary in 2022.
Boehnke said if he gets through this year’s primary in August, he will reach out to the president.
“I voted for the man three times,” he said. And, Boehnke said Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for his influential role in the change in power in Syria and cessation of violence in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.
One Democrat is mounting a bid for the 4th District seat so far: John Duresky, a retired Air Force officer who also worked at the Hanford nuclear cleanup site. Devin Poore, a tech consultant, has launched a campaign as an independent. 
The last Democrat to win a U.S. House seat in the district was former Gov. Jay Inslee. He won in 1992, but lost reelection after one term to Doc Hastings, a Republican, who held the seat until retiring in 2015. 
Washington’s 4th Congressional District stretches through the middle of the state from the Canadian border to Oregon. It includes the agriculture-heavy Yakima Valley, the Yakama Indian Reservation, and the Tri-Cities.
Boehnke’s decision to run has been expected. He expressed interest at the time of Newhouse’s announcement and then formed an exploratory committee.
Candidates are already lining up for his seat in the 8th Legislative District that includes Kennewick and west Pasco.
Gabe Galbraith, president of the Kennewick School District Board of Directors, announced his candidacy earlier this month. A Republican, he’s a product of the Tri-Cities, and graduated from Kamiakin High School.
Galbraith is among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit that sought to overturn a law passed last year that overhauled a 2024 citizen initiative concerning rights for public school students and their parents. A measure on track to reach the ballot in November would achieve much of what the lawsuit seeks.
State Sen. Nikki Torres, R-Pasco, is also reportedly considering the race for Boehnke’s seat. This would require her to abandon her campaign for reelection in the 15th Legislative District. And to move, again.
Torres lives in Pasco. Due to redistricting, her neighborhood wound up in the neighboring 16th Legislative District. She recently secured a place to live in the 15th District to seek a second term. If she decides to run in the 8th District, she would need to find a residence there. 
The district’s two Republican House members, April Connors of Kennewick and Stephanie Barnard of Pasco, are reportedly not interested in the state Senate seat.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20230131_104625ab-2-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-22 17:56:25.284073
,Mississippi Today,2026-01-22 22:47:25+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi considers new strategy to alleviate its child care crisis,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/22/mississippi-child-care-crisis/,"FILE PHOTO: Bob Anderson, right, the state Department of Human Services director, is asking lawmakers to support an increase in monthly TANF checks. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)","The Mississippi Department of Human Services is expected to explore a funding model advocates for months have proposed as a solution to the state’s child care crisis, agency director Bob Anderson announced during a Senate Public Health Committee meeting Wednesday. 
That model would use some of the department’s unspent $156 million in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funds to address the roughly 20,000 working families on a waiting list for child care vouchers, or coupons. Since April, families have been added to the waitlist after pandemic-era funds that had boosted the voucher program ran out. 
The agency has yet to navigate the federal regulations around tapping into TANF funds for this purpose, Anderson said. Mississippi already transfers the maximum 30% of TANF funds to the Child Care Development Fund. That’s the federal block grant that makes up the bulk of the voucher program funding, called the Child Care Payment Program. But other states have successfully channeled additional TANF dollars toward their voucher programs in a way that doesn’t conflict with the transfer cap.
“We have to be sure we identify the families as eligible, and that the money is allocated pursuant to the federal law,” Anderson said to lawmakers during the hearing. 
Senate Public Health Chair Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, then said: “You can do all that, can’t you?” to which Anderson responded he was “certainly going to try.”
Advocates from the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative, the main group pushing the state to use more TANF funds for child care, said Wednesday’s announcement was “extremely encouraging.”
“It’s a very significant development because before, they were sounding like they didn’t think it was possible to do it,” said Carol Burnett, executive director of the group. “But now they’re beginning to say, ‘Well, it’s new for us, we don’t really know how to do it’… The fact that they’re pursuing it is a very promising development.”
The voucher program is currently only serving 18,000 children – about half of what it was serving at the height of the pandemic – according to the Mississippi Department of Human Services. 
Importantly, the enhanced pandemic funding didn’t expand eligibility. Instead, it allowed the program to reach more eligible families. The voucher program has historically only received enough funding to cover 1 in 7 eligible children. 
Working parents consistently struggle to pay for child care in the U.S., where it takes an average of 10% of a married couple’s median income and 35% of a single parent’s income to pay for the weekly expense. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services deems child care that costs more than 7% of a household’s income to be unaffordable. 
The use of additional TANF funds is not the only option on the table to resolve Mississippi’s child care crisis. Anderson asked the Legislature during Wednesday’s hearing to appropriate as much as possible toward the $60 million needed to fund the child care voucher program. Anderson added, however, that because federal cuts have shifted costs to states, he didn’t include an additional child care funding request in his department’s budget request. 
“If the Legislature is inclined to fund child care in a larger amount – whether it be $16 million, $20 million, $25 million, $45 million, whatever amount – we will devote those funds to providing certificates to those families and those children who are on our waiting list right now.”
Last year, the Legislature appropriated $15 million of the $45 million the department requested to the voucher program. This year, the total amount needed has risen to $60 million due to inflation, said Mark Jones, director of communications at the Mississippi Department of Human Services. Meanwhile, the state has assumed $15 million in additional costs to run its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program – another impact of the many federal funding cuts that are tightening the state’s budget. 
The increased need for child care funds coupled with the decrease in available state funds make for a difficult situation. But several lawmakers on either side of the aisle have expressed support of at least matching last year’s $15 million appropriation. 
Meanwhile, Mississippi averted an unrelated child care disaster after the Trump administration froze child care funding to five states – California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York – following allegations of widespread multi-state fraud concerns, which the states have argued the administration has not provided evidence to support. All other states were required to immediately submit new paperwork, including “strong justification” for all child care expenses, to continue drawing down federal funds. 
Mississippi successfully “defended its spend” and was able to draw down federal funds Jan. 16, Jones told Mississippi Today Thursday. 
“Because of the controls we had in place, we were able to so quickly comply,” Jones said. “If the TANF scandal taught us anything, it’s to do it right.”
Mississippi has faced shortages in child care availability long before the recent tumult on the federal level. 
Centers are closing in record numbers, child care workers are providing uncompensated care, and parents are facing impossible decisions – including anecdotal reports that several desperate parents have left their children unattended with at-home security cameras, or “nanny cams,” and were later reported to Child Protective Services. 
The only thing that will resolve the crisis, advocates say, is immediate and significant increase in funding. 
“Employers across the state need the child care industry to be stable, they need parents to have stable child care,” said Matt Williams, director of research at the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative. “There are always improvements that could be made to processes and policies regarding access to affordable child care, but revenue is what’s needed right now. The voucher program has been functioning in recent years pretty well, and what the system needs is more revenue.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/06213109/AP_20064783910360-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-22 17:56:25.284073

(Photo illustration by Catherine Lane/Getty Images)Legislation establishing a tax on certain university endowments moved out of an Iowa House subcommittee Thursday with amendments already on the way.
House File 544 would impose an annual tax on the value of endowments at “certain Iowa colleges and universities,” including state and private institutions, with the rate set at 15% on endowments “in excess of $250 million at the close of the preceding tax year.”
Subcommittee chair Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, said during the meeting that an amendment will be filed before the bill gets brought up in the Iowa House Higher Education Committee, raising the endowment amount threshold to $500 million and changing the taxation level to the corporate tax rate in Iowa.
“I think that’s a little more appropriate,” Collins said.

Collins was joined on the subcommittee by Rep. Timi Brown-Powers, D-Waterloo, and Rep. Heather Hora, R-Washington.
An endowment, as defined in the bill, is the “corpus of funds or other assets held and administered by an educational institution or a related organization to the educational institution, the principal of which is intended to be preserved and invested for the purpose of generating income to support the educational institution’s operations, scholarships, research, or other institutional purposes, whether unrestricted, temporarily restricted, or permanently restricted.”
“Endowment value” is defined in the legislation as “the total aggregate fair market value of all assets constituting the endowment at the close of the preceding tax year.”
Money gathered through the endowment tax from public universities would be placed in the state’s Workforce Grant Incentive Fund.
For private universities, the legislation stipulates the creation of a “high-wage and high-demand job account” within the Iowa Tuition Grant program, which provides scholarships to Iowa students wishing to attend a private institution in the state. Money going into the account would go to students in the Iowa Tuition Grant program earning a degree relating to high-paying, high-demand jobs identified by Iowa Workforce Development and the Iowa Board of Regents.
The bill would also bar public universities from charging or paying another entity “more than five percent of the gross proceeds of any gift made to the institution” and from charging more than 1% of the endowment value in an annual fee for management and administration of the endowment.
Representatives from Iowa’s public and private universities said this bill, if passed, would have a negative impact on university endowments that could lead to them dropping below the $250 million threshold.
Jillian Carlson, state relations officer for the Iowa Board of Regents, told the subcommittee 80% of endowment funds for public universities go toward student scholarships, which are offered indefinitely.
“We always appreciate the state looking for ways to provide scholarships towards students,” Carlson said. “But with the 15% tax proposed in this bill, we do expect for Iowa and Iowa State to have those funds be depleted to below that $250 million level in about 10 to 15 years.”
According to the Iowa State University Foundation, the university’s combined pool of endowments held a balance of $1.63 billion as of June 30, 2025. The University of Iowa Center for Advancement stated that as of July 2025, the three endowments from the center, university and public-private partnership totaled $3.7 billion.
Iowa Association of Independent Colleges and Universities lobbyist Frank Chiodo said the organization is registered opposed to the bill. While an analysis on the potential consequences of the legislation is still being worked on, Chiodo said he’s heard that four or five colleges in Iowa will see a “significant impact.”
Telling the subcommittee he wants to make sure he’s “not in a different universe,” Chiodo said he thinks this bill will set “an interesting precedent to anybody that has an endowment in this state.”
“I really find this interesting — we’re going to tax a nonprofit endowment 15%, because government knows how to spend their money better,” Chiodo said.
Brown-Powers also shared her concerns during the meeting, saying she was surprised to see legislation adding taxes come up and that she would hold back on giving it her approval.
She said language in the bill referring to “certain Iowa schools and certain endowments” makes the legislation seem broad, and it could potentially cause problems for donors who might not want portions of their gifts being pulled from the endowments for taxes.
“As I read it through and really dive into endowments, it looks like we’re just stealing from Peter to pay Paul,” Brown-Powers said. “I don’t know if that’s the best philosophy.”

The new reality of marketplace insurance without federal subsidies may leave Vermonters feeling like, ""I have insurance and I can't afford to use it,"" state health care advocate Mike Fisher said.

Sharon Poddick is someone who budgets down to the last dollar. When she lost her job in companywide layoffs a little over a year ago — and with it, her employer-sponsored health insurance — she and her husband started buying health care from Vermont Health Connect, the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace.
They started to “tighten everywhere we could tighten” when it came to their budget, as Poddick described it. Her car is paid off; she bought her phone refurbished years ago; she’s whittled down expenses wherever she can.
So, when she saw that the subsidies that had made their Affordable Care Act health insurance plan affordable would sunset at the end of 2025, it was like a “tidal wave coming.”

“We were doing well. We were keeping up, and then this hit us,” she said.  
Sharon and her husband, Kurt, are among the thousands of Vermonters for whom a steep increase in health insurance premiums is now the reality. The close of 2025 brought the end of the enhanced advanced premium tax credit, which made subsidies for Affordable Care Act marketplace plans available to those earning more than 400% of the federal poverty line and increased the amount of credits. The original subsidies — for those buying marketplace insurance and making less than 400% of the federal poverty line — remain in place. 
On Jan. 15, the period for enrolling in health insurance through Vermont Health Connect closed without an extension of those federal subsidies that kept many plans affordable.
The Poddicks waited as long as they could before buying a health insurance plan for 2026 — holding out some hope that the back-and-forth in Washington over whether or not to extend the enhanced premiums could bring some resolution. It didn’t. 
Sharon Poddick has since found a new job that she loves, working for a local restaurant group, but her employer is too small to subsidize her insurance. Her husband Kurt is self-employed. They are both 55, and with his job as a contractor, they felt like dropping insurance entirely was not an option.
“It didn’t feel like it was a choice for us. We felt like we had to have some coverage,” Poddick said.
In December they enrolled in the cheapest option available to them: a bronze plan from MVP for $1,700 a month. The deductible is $10,000 for each person.
Just last year they were paying almost half that — $900 — for a gold plan from BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont.
In the first week since enrollment has closed, the state has a first glimpse of how many Vermonters find themselves in a situation like Sharon and Kurt. Early indicators show a health care landscape where many Vermonters may be un- or under-insured.
The numbers of the new landscape  
More than 2,500 Vermonters dropped their plans for 2026, data from the Department of Vermont Health Access shows — nearly five times the rate of disenrollment the state saw last year.
With the loss of subsidies, Vermont has collectively lost around $72 million in federal support, Addie Strumolo deputy commissioner of the Department of Vermont Health Access, told legislators in a Tuesday briefing. Originally the department had estimated the state stood to lose $65 million.
Currently, 30,334 people are still enrolled in marketplace plans. Early data from the department shows many cases like the Poddicks’, where people are shifting the types of plans they enrolled in. 
About one-third of marketplace enrollees opted for bronze plans this year (the least expensive option), an increase of about 4%-5% from last year. Silver plans (which in Vermont are more expensive than gold plans) saw a dip to 13% of the marketplace share, compared to last year’s 21%. This year, 49% of people are in gold plans — last year, that was 45%.


Strumolo gave lawmakers this data with the caveat that though enrollment has closed, “it takes a while for this all to settle out.” As people receive their initial bills, she expects more to drop their coverage, she said. 
The high proportion of gold enrollment is, in part, likely “residual” from last year, she added, describing the state’s push at the time for people to enroll in the plans recently made less expensive than the silver. However, the trend toward bronze is likely a consequence of the high costs without the extended subsidies, she said. 
The next step, Strumolo said, is to look at who is dropping their plans to get a better picture of whether Vermonters are underinsured with the plans they now have — meaning, that even with insurance coverage people are still unable to cover their costs of their care.
Mike Fisher, the state’s health care advocate, explained this need for more context: “The question is not actually how many people (enroll) but it’s also about how well they’re sorted,” he told VTDigger.
Not all enrollees are weighted equally in an insurance plan; a good plan relies on healthy people paying more into the pool than they take out in care costs so that people with higher health needs can have their care covered without paying out every single dollar. The health insurance pool is an equalizer, but when healthy, low-cost people leave, it throws off the balance, he said. 
And, when premium costs go up, those healthy, low-cost people are often the first to leave the pool. 
“Even a small number of people who have low health care costs leaving the market can have a real impact on the costs for the rest of the market,” Fisher said. 
The trend creates a vicious cycle of increasing premium costs. Already, insurers predicted a loss of (relatively healthy) enrollees and baked that into their premium increases for 2026. Fisher expects that next year’s premium increases will reflect the reality of the financial hit insurers are taking with how many healthy people drop coverage this year.
‘I have insurance, and I can’t afford to use it’
Fisher worries particularly about the population who have lost the subsidies and are now struggling to pay for their premiums with high deductibles — people like Sharon and Kurt Poddick.
“The story I hear that I hate the most is ‘I have insurance, and I can’t afford to use it,’ and that’s going to happen more,” Fisher said. 
At the start of the year, the Poddicks canceled all of their upcoming doctors appointments in an effort to save money. Poddick explained she didn’t want to be caught footing the bill for a lab test or other unexpected costs in a regular visit.
“There’s no annual physical happening; there’s nothing that’s routine. We’ve just cut it out,” she said. “I don’t know if I’m going to be able to pay the doctors when I actually go see them.
“The only reason we’re buying this insurance right now, (is) if we have a major medical situation. Otherwise, you’re financially ruined, but you’re also kind of financially ruined by paying the premium every month,” she said.
The reality of a state full of people who do not receive primary or preventive care weighs heavy on many health care experts — not only because of what it means for the well-being of the individuals who can’t access that care, but also what it means for the financial well-being of Vermont’s health care system. 
Earlier interventions and routine primary care can keep insurers and hospitals from footing the bill for more expensive, more advanced health needs — think of routine skin cancer screenings or colonoscopies compared to the costs of treating a progressed cancer. It’s part of why lawmakers in Montpelier are trying to prioritize primary care in proposed legislation this session.
When people do face inevitable health care emergencies, they often land in a hospital’s emergency room, regardless of if they have insurance. Hospitals end up bearing the costs when treating patients unable to pay for care. 
The loss of any revenue could be catastrophic for Vermont’s already financially precarious hospitals, Owen Foster, who chairs the Green Mountain Care Board, explained to legislators in October. 
Though the scope of what the loss of subsidies will mean for the state is broad and sweeping, what it means for an individual is a daily, detailed management. 
Sharon Poddick is trying to pick up extra hours working a part-time job in the evenings, to supplement the new full-time job she’s found working for a local restaurant group. Her husband, the contractor, is trying to do the same by taking on a few more projects. 
Each month, paying the premium is a little victory. “We celebrated having January covered,” Poddick said. “I don’t know about February, but we try to do what we can with the premium and just take it month to month.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Ethics Commission has filed suit against a Texas vendor for allegedly failing to deliver a campaign finance reporting system despite repeated assurances and deadline extensions.
The failure of RFD & Associates, Inc., cost the state over $800,000, according to Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, who is representing the agency.
The suit was filed Thursday in Oklahoma County District Court.
In December 2024, the Ethics Commission contracted with RFD & Associates, Inc., to create a new ethics filing system for a mandated filing, review and public disclosure. The system, among other things, allows candidates to file contribution and expenditure reports, which are accessible electronically to the public.
With the exception of the project kickoff, the company allegedly failed to meet six of seven major contractual milestones and never produced an operational system, according to the lawsuit.
“Throughout the project, RFD repeatedly provided system-ready assurances despite known deficiencies, forcing the Ethics Commission to issue public delay notices, extend deadlines to filers, and field daily inquiries from legislators, candidates, PACs, lobbyists, political subdivisions, the media, and the public,” according to the lawsuit.
RFD & Associates could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday. It wasn’t clear if they had an attorney.
The Ethics Commission voted in December to terminate its contract with the company after three months without a fully functioning campaign finance system.
At the same meeting, the Commission voted to reinstate the original Guardian system and entered into a $217,000 contract with a partner of its previous vendor.
The Commission also authorized legal action.
RFD and Associates’ failures prevented and impeded the Ethics Commission from performing its constitutional and statutory duties, according to the suit.
The company misrepresented its experience and capabilities, the suit said.
The lawsuit asserts multiple claims, including breach of contract, fraud, unjust enrichment, negligent misrepresentation, breach of warranties and violations of the Oklahoma Deceptive Trade Practices Act.
It seeks in excess of $800,000.
Drummond said in a statement that he will hold those accountable who fail to deliver on their commitments.
“When vendors misrepresent their capabilities and leave essential systems inoperable, taxpayers deserve accountability and the recovery of public funds,” Drummond said.

Delaware Division of the Arts announces 2026 Individual Artist Fellowship recipients
The Delaware Division of the Arts has announced the recipients of its 2026 Individual Artist Fellowships, awarding a total of $184,000 to 27 artists from across the state.
The annual program recognizes exceptional artistic quality among Delaware-based musicians, writers, and folk, media, and visual artists. This year’s cycle drew 246 applications, the highest number the program has received, according to the Division of the Arts. In response to the demand, the agency increased its fellowship funding pool by 20 percent.
Since 2020, the Individual Artist Fellowship program has awarded more than $950,000 to artists statewide.
Applicants were reviewed by out-of-state arts professionals, who evaluated work samples for creativity and technical skill within each discipline. Fellowships were awarded across three categories: one Master Fellow, 14 Established Fellows, and 12 Emerging Fellows. Five additional artists were named runners-up and will receive honoraria.
Award amounts range from $5,000 for Emerging Professional Fellows to $12,000 for the Master Fellowship. Fellowship funds may be used flexibly, including for materials, equipment, studio time, rehearsal space, and other costs associated with artistic production. Fellowship recipients are also required to present at least one public exhibition or performance in the coming year.
“Delaware’s individual artists are the foundation of our cultural life, and these fellowships invest directly in their ability to make new work,” said Jessica Ball, Director of the Delaware Division of the Arts. “With 246 applications this year, we expanded the funding pool by 20% and are recognizing additional finalists with honoraria – so more exceptional Delaware artists can create, take risks, and share work with the public.”
“Artist fellowship funding helps artists cover the real costs of creating – materials, equipment, studio time, rehearsal space, and the dedicated time it takes to develop strong work,” said Roxanne Stanulis, Program Officer, Artist Programs and Services. “That flexibility supports individual artists while also bringing measurable value back to communities through exhibitions, performances, and the vitality that artists generate across Delaware.”
The 2026 fellows live throughout Delaware, including Milford, Georgetown, Lewes, Rehoboth Beach, Bethany Beach, Newark, Wilmington, Middletown, Smyrna, New Castle, Bear, Magnolia, Townsend, and Farmington.
Master Fellowship
The Master Fellowship rotates among artistic disciplines each year. For 2026, applications were accepted in Visual Arts and Folk Arts from artists who had previously received an Established Professional Fellowship.
Dennis Beach was selected as the 2026 Master Fellow in Visual Arts: Sculpture. Beach, a Wilmington-based sculptor and painter, has maintained a full-time studio practice for more than 20 years. His work explores color, geometric form, and movement and has been exhibited widely across the East Coast. Beach holds an M.F.A. from the University of Delaware and a B.F.A. from the Maryland Institute College of Art.

That’s a nearly 6% drop from the prior year, when more than 110,000 enrolled.
Comprehensive open enrollment data is not yet available for all states, but preliminary numbers released by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services earlier this month suggested open enrollment was down 3.5% nationally from the previous year.
According to Nevada HealthLink, nearly 7 in 10 enrollees actively shopped the exchange for 2026 insurance, a 32% increase in engagement over the prior year.
Of people that enrolled, 20,911 were new enrollees and 42,652 were active re-enrollees. Compared to the prior year, that is nearly 6,000 fewer new enrollees, and almost twice as many active re-enrollees.
Engagement by re-enrollees may have been driven by a desire to find cheaper plan options after premiums for their existing plans skyrocketed.
Insurance premiums for existing plans were approved by the state for an average rate increase of 26% for coverage in 2026.
Nevada’s public option — called Battle Born State Plans — accounted for 10% of total enrollment. Public option plans cover the same essential health benefits required by the Affordable Care Act, but they are designed to cost less.

Greater Wilmington Beer Week returns February 16 through February 22, inviting residents and visitors to explore the region’s craft beer scene through a full week of specials, features, and community-focused events across Wilmington and New Castle County.
Presented by Out & About, the annual celebration shines a spotlight on local breweries, restaurants, and bars while encouraging people to get out during the winter season and support small businesses. Participating locations are expected to offer featured beers, limited-time releases, food pairings, and themed experiences that highlight the creativity and variety of the area’s brewing community.
“Greater Wilmington Beer Week gave our brewers, Matt and Brandon, the opportunity to experiment with a new variation of our blended fruit sour line, ‘Berried Inhibitions,’” said Joe Hoddinott, Director of Art and Marketing Mayhem at Twisted Irons Craft Brewing Co. in Newark. “By adding cherry and plum to the mix, they created something that’s sure to be a sweet and refreshing offering.”
One of the most popular elements of Greater Wilmington Beer Week is the official Beer Week Passport, which adds an interactive layer to the experience. Attendees are encouraged to download and print the passport before the week begins, then bring it along as they visit participating locations. Each stop earns a stamp, turning a casual night out into a fun challenge that rewards exploration.
Once participants collect stamps from at least five different locations, they can submit their completed passport to be entered for a chance to win prizes. The passport program is designed to encourage people to try new venues, revisit favorites, and experience the variety of breweries and restaurants that take part in Beer Week each year.
While the passport offers a structured way to participate, Beer Week is intentionally flexible. Some attendees plan multiple outings throughout the week, using the passport as a guide to explore different neighborhoods and beer styles. Others may choose just one or two events that fit their schedule. Whether guests are sampling flights, attending a featured tasting, or enjoying a beer paired with dinner, the experience can be tailored to individual interests.
Greater Wilmington Beer Week also emphasizes collaboration within the local food and beverage community. In past years, brewers and venues have worked together to create special releases and unique offerings available only during the week. These collaborations give attendees an opportunity to taste something new while learning more about the brewing process and the inspiration behind each beer.
“The craft beer industry as a whole has been going through rough times over the last few years taking its toll on breweries across the US. Delaware’s craft beer community are your family, friends, neighbors, and passionate beer lovers – working together to keep the craft beer industry in our first state strong. Greater Wilmington Beer Week allows Delaware breweries and restaurants to stand together and raise a glass as one,” said Hoddinott.
As the region’s craft beer scene continues to expand, Beer Week plays an important role in showcasing both established favorites and emerging voices. It also reinforces the idea that breweries and restaurants are community gathering places, offering more than just a drink but an opportunity to connect with others.
Whether attendees are longtime craft beer fans or simply looking for a reason to get out during winter, Greater Wilmington Beer Week offers a welcoming way to explore local flavor, discover new spots, and cheers the people behind the pours.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)





Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency Thursday as Arkansas braces for a severe winter storm that will bring heavy snow, ice and near-zero temperatures statewide.
The winter storm is set to begin rolling into Arkansas Friday afternoon, part of a system that’s expected to affect a dozen states and roughly 60 million people, private forecasting service AccuWeather says. 
Dave Parker, spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Transportation, warned that the system set to hit the state is unlike winter storms that typically blow through the region and will make it “a very difficult battle” to clear roads. The only thing going in the state’s favor, he said, was that the storm is set to hit over a weekend. 
Parker said any winter precipitation likely won’t thaw out until Wednesday, and urged people to stay home if they could. 
“We’ve got everything working against us,” he said. “We’ve got freezing rain, ice, snow, sleet, bitter cold temperatures, a long storm — meaning several days.”
What parts of the state will be affected?
South Arkansas is likely to get some combination of freezing rain and sleet, according to the National Weather Service’s North Little Rock office, while the northern region is likely to experience heavy snowfall. The storm is set to begin rolling in Friday evening as of Thursday afternoon.
Weather service forecasts are still unsure where snow will transition to sleet and freezing rain, though it notes it will likely be somewhere in central or south Arkansas. Forecasts as of Thursday afternoon project between a half an inch to three-quarters of an inch of ice in areas south of Little Rock. Areas north of Russellville are forecasted to receive between eight to 12 inches of snow, though higher amounts are possible.
The service said uncertainty remains about where snowfall would transition into sleet and freezing rain. 
“Dangerously cold temperatures” are expected through Tuesday morning, according to the North Little Rock office. Wind chills could reach 10 degrees below zero, it said, with colder temperatures possible further north.
The North Little Rock office has been posting detailed breakdowns of its latest forecasts statewide on its X account. Click here to see its Thursday morning post.
What is the state doing to prepare?
Sanders’ emergency declaration authorizes $250,000 for disaster response, and allows “emergency response vehicles and commercial carriers delivering essential supplies and services” to bypass state-run weight stations until Feb. 23.
Schools around the state have canceled Friday’s after-school and weekend events ahead of the storm. They’re closely monitoring the forecast before making a decision about classes Friday.
What should I do to prepare?
State transportation officials say roads will remain hazardous into next week. In extreme cold, the National Weather Service recommends avoiding being outside, bringing pets inside, dripping faucets and ensuring vehicles have at least half a tank of gas. 
Where can I find trustworthy information about forecasted weather?
The National Weather Service offices in North Little Rock, Memphis, Shreveport or Tulsa, depending on where you live. Arkansans can find the most up-to-date forecasts, as well as information about different scenarios forecasters are seeing in their weather models on their websites. However, the National Weather Service in North Little Rock has also been posting detailed breakdowns of the latest forecasts for the entire state on its X account. 
Where can I find information about road conditions?
The Arkansas Department of Transportation’s mobile app and website, iDrive Arkansas, has a winter driving conditions map layer. It will have the most current information about road conditions on state highways and interstates, but it doesn’t have condition information for local and county roads.
Will I lose power?
There is no guarantee, but ice storms pose greater threats to power infrastructure compared to snow storms because the ice can down trees and weigh down power lines.
Entergy Arkansas is preparing for outages and staging 3,500 linemen to respond to outages due to the storm, with the focus being on the southern half of the state where ice is projected to be a greater threat, spokesperson Lamor Williams said.
However, if power does go out, he said he could not give an estimate for how long people should prepare to be without power.
“Our goal is to restore power as quickly and safely as possible,” Williams said. “So it could be a few days, it could be more than a few days, but I don’t know that there’s a way to really say how long you should be prepared for.”
Outages affecting emergency services and “large blocks of customers” will be addressed first before more isolated outages, he said.
Entergy customers with questions can go to the utility’s mobile app or website, he said. 
What should I do if I need to drive?
Arkansas transportation crews are working to treat all of the major roads before the storm system rolls in. Parker said single-digit temperatures will make it harder to treat and clear roads, making it difficult to estimate when roads will be clear again.
If you can’t stay home, Parker said you should give yourself significantly more time to get to your destination than you normally would. He said preparing to be in your car for long periods of time is paramount in case you get stuck.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Vice President JD Vance on Thursday blamed Minnesota elected officials for the clashes between federal agents and protesters, arguing that their refusal to facilitate the federal government’s immigration enforcement is the cause of the chaos across the Twin Cities.
Vance held a closed-door roundtable with federal agents, law enforcement and businesses. The Minnesota Chamber of Commerce and Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, confirmed after the fact that they were in the room with Vance, though other participants are unknown.
Vance took questions from reporters, defending the actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and downplaying recent, high-profile instances of alleged civil rights violations committed by federal agents.
In at least one instance, Vance misled the public when he said the Trump administration is focused on Minneapolis because “that’s where we have the highest concentration of people who have violated our immigration laws.” This is false.
Pew Research estimates that 130,000 undocumented immigrants lived in Minnesota as of 2023.
States that are the most populous — California, Texas, Florida and New York — had the highest concentration of unauthorized immigrations, a combined 8 million in 2023.
A reporter asked the vice president about agents detaining a 5-year-old boy, whom the Columbia Heights Public School district says agents used as “bait” to draw family members away from their homes.
Vance said the incident is an example of the media failing to provide context about ICE’s arrests. Vance said the boy was not arrested, but the boy’s father was in the country illegally. When ICE approached the father, he ran and left his child, Vance said.
“Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death? Are they not supposed to arrest an illegal alien in the United States of America?” Vance asked sarcastically. “… If we had a little cooperation from local … and state officials, I think the chaos would go way down in this community.”
At a Thursday press conference, a lawyer for the boy’s family disputed that the father was in the country illegally, stating he came into the country a few years ago seeking asylum.
Vance said the administration wants Minnesota law enforcement to work with the federal government and honor ICE “detainers.” Detainers are written requests from ICE that a local jail or other law enforcement detain an individual for an additional 48 hours to give ICE time to decide to take the person into federal custody to begin removal proceedings.
Minnesota officials say that they honor ICE detainers. In addition, some of the arrests that ICE claims to have made in recent weeks were people already in prison that Minnesota handed over.
Vance downplays arrests of U.S. citizens
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit last week alleging that immigration authorities are racially profiling Minnesota residents and detaining people with legal status, even U.S. citizens. Numerous U.S. citizens have said they’ve been arrested by ICE.
When asked about alleged instances of racial profiling and arrests of U.S. citizens, Vance said citizens are arrested because they’ve assaulted immigration agents, and agents are not looking for people based on skin color.
“When there are American citizens who have been caught up in some of these enforcement operations, very often it is people who have assaulted a law enforcement officer,” Vance said. “They’re not being arrested because they violated the immigration laws. They’re being arrested because they punched a federal law enforcement officer. That is a totally reasonable thing.”
He again blamed Minnesota officials.
“So long as we had more cooperation, I think they can do these things in a much more targeted way. They would actually know where some of the bad guys are,” Vance said.
Vance said that based on what he heard in his roundtable Thursday, he doesn’t believe the Insurrection Act needs to be invoked at this time, like President Donald Trump threatened last week. The Insurrection Act is a rarely-invoked 19th century law that would allow Trump to send the military to Minnesota.
“What I do worry about again is that the chaos gets worse. If more and more ICE agents are getting assaulted, if other law enforcement officers start getting assaulted, that would be a real problem,” Vance said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2257643398-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-22 17:36:30.145621
,Mississippi Today,2026-01-22 22:26:35+00:00,Mississippi Today,ACLU and Center for Constitutional Rights sue Rankin County DA over public records of ‘Goon Squad’ cases,Jerry Mitchell and Mukta Joshi,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/22/groups-sue-rankin-da-over-public-records-of-goon-squad-cases/,"The Rankin County Justice Center in Brandon, Miss.","A new lawsuit accuses Rankin County prosecutors of refusing to release public records that could play a role in reversing wrongful convictions resulting from criminal acts by a “Goon Squad” of deputies, many of whom are serving decades in federal prison.
For a generation, Rankin County Sheriff’s Department deputies, some of whom called themselves the “Goon Squad,” used “torture, violence, and other abusive practices to coerce confessions and extract or manufacture evidence for criminal cases prosecuted primarily by the Rankin County District Attorney’s Office,” the lawsuit alleges. 
The ACLU of Mississippi and the Center for Constitutional Rights filed the lawsuit Thursday in Rankin County Chancery Court.
“Due to that misconduct, the Goon Squad was responsible for profound suffering by community members, including numerous wrongful convictions,” says the lawsuit, which represents one side of a legal argument.
The lawsuit cites reporting by Mississippi Today and The New York Times, which included revelations from former Rankin County deputy Christian Dedmon about how he and others in his department regularly entered homes without warrants, beat people to get information and illegally seized evidence that helped convict people of drug crimes.
His statements corroborated many aspects of the publications’ investigation that uncovered a two-decade reign of terror by Rankin County sheriff’s deputies, including those who called themselves the “Goon Squad.” Dedmon’s statements also shed new light on the deputies’ tactics and the scope of their violent and illegal behavior.
In 2023, Dedmon and five other officers barged into a home without a warrant and then beat and tortured two Black men, Eddie Parker and Michael Jenkins. One of the deputies shoved a gun in Jenkins’ mouth and shot him, shattering his jaw. To conceal their crimes, the deputies destroyed surveillance footage, planted false evidence and lied to investigators. 
After a state and federal investigation, Dedmon and the other officers pleaded guilty and were sentenced to federal prison in 2024.

Soon after Dedmon’s statements were published by Mississippi Today and The Times on Dec. 23, the civil rights organizations filed a public records request with the Rankin County District Attorney’s Office related to actions taken in response to the Goon Squad’s abuses. District Attorney Bubba Bramlett denied their request. 
“Given the documented and admitted misconduct of multiple Rankin County officers, which spans the course of two decades, the lack of transparency is deeply troubling,” said Ayanna Hill, a racial justice staff attorney with the ACLU of Mississippi. “Extraordinary measures should not be required to obtain records that, by law, belong to the public.”
The lawsuit asks the court to compel the district attorney to release a list of cases involving Goon Squad officers, actions taken in response to those revelations and communications between prosecutors and those officers.
The District Attorney’s office did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication of this story.
In a March 2024 statement to Mississippi Today, Bramlett said his office conducted an “extensive review to identify any and all cases in which these officers were involved.” He said his office dismissed those indicted cases and didn’t go forward with cases where “the integrity of the investigation may have been compromised.”
Mississippi Today found dozens of drug cases dismissed in the wake of the 2023 Goon Squad arrests. Some of these dismissals cited the unavailability of those deputies, who are incarcerated, as witnesses. Bramlett’s office wouldn’t divulge any details of its review, including how many cases have been dismissed and how far back his review went.

According to local defense lawyers, the district attorney’s office is not reviewing cases where defendants pleaded guilty, ruling out a vast majority of drug cases involving the deputies. Dedmon estimated deputies conducted hundreds of home search break-ins without warrants in recent years.
When the civil rights organizations asked for a list of all the cases that Goon Squad officers had been involved in over the past four years, Bramlett’s office responded that it had no such list.
“The Rankin County District Attorney’s Office prosecuted and convicted people with the Goon Squad’s help. It should be eager to provide the public with information about what it’s doing to address,” said Terry Ding, a staff attorney with the ACLU State Supreme Court Initiative. “But instead, it is unlawfully withholding all of its records except one self-serving statement to the press.” 
Ding said that the public “has a right to know how their public officials respond to cases of severe police misconduct.”
Center for Constitutional Rights Justice Fellow and attorney Korbin Felder said in a press release in the wake of Rankin County’s largest law enforcement scandal, “the District Attorney’s office should have created a transparent process of disclosing records and reviewing all cases involving these officers. 
“Rather than providing the citizens of Rankin County and the victims of law enforcement abuse the transparency and accountability they deserve, the District Attorney’s office continues to insist that the public and the victims are not entitled to such,” Felder said.
The lawsuit says Bramlett’s office had “a legal duty to disclose misconduct by those officers to the people being prosecuted as well as those convicted.”
Peter Neufeld, co-founder of the nonprofit Innocence Project, said the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1963 decision in Brady v. Maryland requires prosecutors to disclose any evidence that might clear a defendant, even if the evidence arises after that person’s conviction.
The lawsuit in Rankin County cites the case of Ron Shinstock, who is serving a 40-year prison sentence after he was convicted in part by the testimony of Chief Inspector Brett McAlpin, who federal prosecutors described as the “ringleader” for the 2023 attack on Jenkins and Parker.
McAlpin led a violent raid of Shinstock’s home, holding his children at gunpoint and forcing him to strip naked in his backyard. According to the lawsuit, McAlpin and other deputies beat him, threatened him with sexual abuse and told him he would be raped in prison. Shinstock’s friend was reportedly beaten so badly that he bled from his ears.
In emails and phone calls, Dedmon delineated the drug raids that occurred in Rankin County almost every week for years.
He said deputies regularly brutalized and humiliated suspects to get them to share information during the raids. And he said they often seized evidence without a legally required warrant, raising questions about possible wrongful convictions in hundreds of narcotics cases stemming from the raids.
For some raids, Dedmon said, the deputies would falsely describe emergency circumstances that gave them cover for searching without a warrant. For others, they would falsely claim that evidence was in plain sight, he said.
Dedmon said deputies were entering homes without warrants so often that in 2022 McAlpin passed on a warning from a prosecutor in the district attorney’s office demanding that “the warrantless entries had to stop.” The warning was specifically aimed at him, according to what McAlpin told him, Dedmon recalled. “He said to me that times are changing at the D.A.’s office.”
The lawsuit cited Dedmon’s remark, saying this information suggests the office knew of this “massive misconduct” but failed to inform the public or those arrested by Goon Squad officers.
“To this day, neither criminal defendants nor the public have been informed of the full scope and gravity of the Goon Squad’s misconduct,” according to the lawsuit.
In 2023, while investigating allegations against the Goon Squad, reporters for Mississippi Today and The Times sought copies of warrants related to nine raids by the unit. The department did not provide the warrants and referred reporters to the district attorney’s office, which declined to release any documentation.
Jason Dare, the lawyer for the Sheriff’s Department, has said that Dedmon’s remarks insinuate “that investigators with the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department do not procure search warrants for residential searches. Such a generalized accusation against our investigators is false, defamatory and easily disproven through readily available public records.”
Dare said Dedmon’s statements to Mississippi Today show the former narcotics investigator “admits that he knew right from wrong and admits to falsifying reports to the Sheriff’s Department, both of which show that the training and policies of this department taught him how to legally and properly perform his duties. Assuming these statements are accurately reported, they show that Dedmon made the choice to commit criminal acts and is incarcerated as a result.”
Dare said the sheriff “has remained committed to the safety and protection of Rankin County citizens.”
Krissy Nobile, director of the Mississippi Office of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel, had volunteered her office to help review past Goon Squad cases to determine what, if any, wrongful convictions took place.
That offer still stands, Nobile told Mississippi Today: “Our office specializes in post-conviction.”
Meanwhile, Shinstock is scheduled to be released in 2056, just before his 82nd birthday. “I lost my family, I lost my home,” he said. “I lost my life.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/05070530/8.23.23BrandonDOYLE-11-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-22 17:36:30.145621

(File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina legislators are again considering changes to how the state vets its judges, this time giving the governor total control of the panel that screens them.
Under the proposal backed by House GOP leadership, the governor would appoint all 12 members of the Judicial Merit Selection Commission — eight lawyers and four members of law enforcement. None could be legislators.
A House panel voted 4-1 Thursday to advance the legislation to the full Judiciary Committee.
In addition to booting the screening panel’s six legislators, the proposal would also prevent the appointment of any immediate family members of legislators. Former legislators would have to be out of office for two years before they or their family — specifically, their spouses, children and siblings — could apply for a seat on the panel.
Rom Reddy is pushing the measure, a year after founding DOGE SC, a political action committee borrowing its name from the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency.
The Isle of Palms millionaire, who made headlines for suing the state after being told to remove an illegal seawall built to protect his beachfront home, began circulating the proposal in the fall ahead of the regular legislative session.
The Legislature already tweaked the selection system in 2024. Those changes, which went into effect in July, gave the governor a seat at the table for the first time.
Governor signs law adjusting how SC picks its judges but calls for more ‘meaningful’ reform

The new proposal would give the state’s chief executive control over all the seats.
“Someone will have influence on this panel,” said Rep. Spencer Wetmore. “All I’m hearing is that we want to switch who has the influence to be the governor’s cronies.”
The Folly Beach Democrat was the only member to vote against the bill. She also pointed out that two of the people who have pushed for these changes — Attorney General Alan Wilson and U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina’s 5th District — are now running for governor.
Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, speaking to reporters in November, also expressed skepticism about the proposal.
“Everybody’s got an agenda,” the Edgefield Republican said. “Right now, we have eight competing agendas. This proposal would have us have one agenda in the selection process.  And I think that’s just something everybody needs to understand. Is that what you want? Does that better the process?”
The Legislature’s last law change already removed some of what was viewed as undue influence from the panel by instituting term limits and forwarding to the General Assembly more qualified candidates to choose from.
South Carolina is among two states where the Legislature elects most judges.
Previously, the panel could send a maximum of three choices, meaning some qualified candidates were left out of the final election by a joint assembly.
The change doubled that number to six qualified candidates.
None of this year’s judicial races had more than six candidates, so nearly all will go to a vote.
The screening panel found three candidates — two seeking a newly created Family Court seat and one in a crowded race for a seat on the state’s Administrative Law Court — unqualified. The reasons for those candidates’ dismissals have yet to be made public.
Massey said he’s open to further debate on the matter, but he’d first like to see how this year’s judicial elections go. The floor votes are scheduled for March 4.
“I’m open to other changes,” he said. “I’m just not convinced that this proposal fixes a real problem.”
In a rare contest for re-election, SC Supreme Court justice defends opinions on state abortion law

Beyond the makeup of the board, the proposal also strips out language in existing law encouraging the panel to consider racial and gender diversity within the judiciary when screening candidates.
The bill would not only remove a line inserted into state law in 1996 but would tell members not to consider “race, gender, sex, sexual preference, color, religion, national origin … or any diversity, equity, and inclusion criteria … at any time, for any reason.”
Only one organization, the state chapter of the League of Women Voters, testified on the bill.
Lynn Teague, who represents the league at the Statehouse, said the organization supports keeping legislators off the panel as a way to balance power between the branches of government. But the league would still like to see the General Assembly have some voice in who sits on that panel.
Teague said the league also is opposed to the new anti-DEI language.
“I know this a very hot-button cultural issue right now, but I’ve also heard the chief justice of our state Supreme Court comment that we need a judiciary that looks more like South Carolina,” she said.
Of the 125 judges across South Carolina’s Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Circuit Court and Family Court, 48 judges are women — including 14 women of color. At least seven male judges are from a racial minority, including one Hispanic man.
“Could we find ourselves in a position where our state is moving backwards towards the days of when a minority or a woman had an almost impossible time of getting to the bench?” asked Rep. Justin Bamberg, D-Bamberg, who nevertheless voted for the bill.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JMSC-resized-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-22 17:36:30.145621

While the Senate appears to remain opposed to the House’s push for sending public dollars to private schools, the chamber’s Education Committee passed bills with many of the House’s other proposals on Thursday.
The panel of lawmakers advanced 15 measures over a nearly three-hour hearing, including four bills that mirror segments of the House’s omnibus bill. 
The committee passed bills that would extend a literacy act that helped raise reading scores in Mississippi into higher grades and establish a similar math act. It also approved bills that would create a framework for school consolidations and mandate financial literacy education for high school graduation.
“A lot of stuff from last year passed again today, and then a lot of new stuff that you’ve probably seen in a House bill somewhere,” Senate Education Committee Chairman Dennis DeBar, a Republican from Leakesville, told reporters after the meeting. “But, as I said before, we have most everything in House Bill 2, and we’re gonna pass it.”
An adolescent literacy expansion, which the Mississippi Department of Education estimates would cost $9 million, would send more literacy coaches to schools and establish an eighth-grade reading gate, akin to the test that third-graders are required to pass to graduate. 
The math act passed by the committee on Thursday is similar — with a cost of about $3.5 million. Lawmakers and education officials are aiming to replicate the state’s reading gains in math by deploying coaches and testing students at least three times a year to identify weaknesses.
The bill was amended to specify the use of high-quality instructional materials after committee Vice-Chairman David Blount, a Democrat from Jackson, pushed back, asking for a standardized curriculum and closer alignment with the state’s literacy legislation.
“We established a model that works, and I want to stick to that model,” he said.
The committee also passed a bill that would broaden the powers of the Commission on School District Efficiency, which the Legislature established years ago. The bill would require the commission to give the Legislature recommendations on school consolidations as early as the next session. 
Then, if any consolidations are approved by the Legislature, they would begin July 2028, DeBar said. 
Another bill that the committee approved Thursday, which mirrors a section of House Bill 2, would require financial literacy education for Mississippi students. 
The Senate committee previously passed three other components of House Bill 2 — easing public school transfer regulations, making it easier for retirees to return to the classroom and raising assistant teacher pay. 
The committee has passed more than a third of the provisions in House Bill 2 altogether, and more are coming. Senators have filed bills promoting prayer in school and permitting homeschooled students to play sports at their assigned public school, both pieces of the omnibus House bill. 
The panel on Thursday also took up 11 other education measures that would give more money to schools for their gifted students, raise the salaries of school attendance officers, allow school boards to enact cellphone bans during school hours, permit the earlier distribution of procurement cards that teachers use to buy classroom supplies and create an ombudsman office within the state education department.
One bill that would have revoked the charter of charter schools that are rated D or F for longer than two years was listed on the committee agenda. However, DeBar, who’s been outspoken about his disapproval of the performance of the state’s charter schools, cut the meeting short without bringing the bill up for a vote.
“I don’t anticipate bringing that back up,” he said. 
The bills passed by the committee can now be considered by the full chamber. 
Lt. Governor Delbert Hosemann referred House Bill 2 to the Senate Education Committee this week. DeBar said he will take it up in committee, but he has repeatedly said the Senate opposes any measure that includes a voucher system of using public tax dollars for private schooling.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/06163509/829A0796.jpg,,,2026-01-22 17:36:30.145621
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-22 22:19:07+00:00,CT Mirror,CT House Dems vote against Homeland Security funding bill,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/22/dhs-funding-vote-ct-democrats-oppose/,The DHS funding bill narrowly cleared the Republican-led House as Congress seeks to fund the rest of the government before Jan. 30.,"Connecticut’s congressional delegation joined most House Democrats on Thursday in opposing a bill that funds the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, citing ongoing concerns over the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and the lack of significant reforms attached to the bill to rein it in.
Still, the DHS funding bill narrowly cleared the Republican-led House as Congress seeks to wrap up its work to fund the rest of the federal government before the Jan. 30 deadline. And more lawmakers in both parties, including from Connecticut, voted to approve full-year funding for the remaining three government agencies in a subsequent vote.
The House took separate votes on the DHS bill, which includes funding for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and another package that consolidates funding for the final three government agencies — Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; Defense, and Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. 
Congress must pass 12 appropriations bills to fund the federal government for fiscal year 2026. The House had already passed eight of the 12 bills, and after the Thursday afternoon votes, it completed its work a week before the deadline.
Now that both bills separately passed, the House will combine the DHS funding measure with a group of other funding bills and send it over to the Senate. That sets up a high-stakes fight in the Senate next week to fund the remainder of government. Because of the clash over resources for ICE, that puts some funding at risk and raises the possibility of a partial shutdown.
“The Department of Homeland Security should not receive one more cent of government funding until we see accountability for the death of Renee Good and the other atrocities being visited on our communities,” U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District, said in a statement. “If my Republican colleagues were genuinely interested in furthering legal and humane immigration efforts, they would have supported meaningful reforms that ensure ICE officers do not threaten the safety or civil liberties of Americans. Instead, we’re voting on a bill that enables an indefensible status quo.”
Democrats sought accountability for ICE through the congressional appropriations process. Members of the state’s delegation wanted various reforms including funding for body cameras, reducing the number of detention beds, banning masks or face coverings for agents and requiring arrest warrants.
The compromise legislation released earlier this week included some of those reforms sought by Democrats, but Connecticut’s appropriators who played a role in negotiations acknowledged the bill fell short of their party’s broader demands — and the political reality of whether they could support such legislation.
Still, U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, who serves as ranking member on the House Appropriations Committee, said it took “steps in the right direction.” She also cautioned that DHS operating on another short-term funding bill would give wider discretion to Trump officials on how to use the money compared to a full-year appropriations bill that would direct how the funding can be used.
“The bill takes several steps in the right direction, such as cutting ICE enforcement and removal operations and reducing the number of detention beds, but it does not include broader reforms Democrats proposed,” DeLauro said in a statement on Tuesday.
“I understand that many of my Democratic colleagues may be dissatisfied with any bill that funds ICE,” she continued. “I share their frustration with the out-of-control agency. I encourage my colleagues to review the bill and determine what is best for their constituents and communities.”
It was unclear at the time how DeLauro would cast her vote on the bill. But as she managed floor debate, a couple of hours before Thursday’s vote, DeLauro explained why she wouldn’t be able to support legislation she played a role in negotiating.
In an emotional speech from the House floor, DeLauro said she’s become more fearful for two grandsons who are adopted but are U.S. citizens. She recounted telling one of them, who is Guatemalan, to carry around his passport in Los Angeles “because it scares me that because of his brown skin he can be pulled aside and he can be detained and he can be deported, and he’s a United States citizen.”
“I was hopeful as a ranking member of Appropriations … to get what we need to get done. We were on a good track, but we have to face the circumstances, we have to deal with the environment, we have to deal with what’s happened in this country. And we cannot turn a blind eye,” DeLauro said Thursday from the floor of the House.
“This is a moment and a vote that says you have to determine what you believe is the right thing to do,” she continued. “I’ve made that decision and the right thing for me to do is vote no on this bill.”
She noted that she doesn’t support abolishing the enforcement agency, like some of her colleagues do, but concluded by saying ICE needs reforms.
A growing number of Democrats didn’t want to see any new funding for ICE given the additional $75 billion allocated over four years in Republicans’ “big beautiful bill” for expanding the agency’s detention capacity and hiring more officers. 
The funding bills now head to the Senate, where Democratic votes are needed to advance most legislation. Lawmakers must reach a 60-vote threshold, meaning Republicans will need at least seven Democrats to move it toward final passage.
Congress is trying to avoid another shutdown after a record-long one last fall over health care demands. That one lasted for 43 days and affected all part of the federal government, including an unprecedented temporary hold on SNAP benefits.
If there’s another funding lapse at the end of the month, it would affect a smaller portion of the government, since many agencies will be funded. But the remaining agencies that need new full-year funding cover a large part of the government. And outside of ICE, the Department of Homeland Security also oversees TSA, FEMA and the U.S. Coast Guard.
But U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said he can’t get support funding for DHS without reforms — and the bill coming before Congress falls short of that threshold. Some of those demands that didn’t make it into the final product included preventing U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents from being moved off the border and into the interior, requiring warrants for certain arrests and protocol around mandatory training.
He was strongly opposed to the bill when it was released on Tuesday. And his trip this week to south Texas to learn more about ICE’s enforcement and detainments were “more evidence of how critical this moment is and how DHS does not deserve to be funded without reforms.”
“We shouldn’t let Republicans bully us again into funding a lawless administration,” Murphy said in a Thursday interview. “I just don’t think we will be perceived as credible if we vote to fund DHS’ illegality and abuse for the rest of the year while talking like it’s a moral and legal crisis.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25309667831751-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-22 17:36:30.145621

The Kossuth County flock which had about 7,000 pheasants and 120 chickens, according to a spokesperson with IDALS, marked the first Iowa bird flu case of 2026. 
IDALS last announced a detection of the bird flu in a Dallas County, mixed species flock in late December.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the H5N1 strain of HPAI has impacted more than 186 million domestic birds since the outbreak began in 2022. 
So far in January 2026, APHIS reports more than 1.1 million birds have been affected by the flu, with the majority of outbreaks for the month occurring in Minnesota and Kansas. 
HPAI can impact both domestic and wild birds, though it is often fatal for domestic birds. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation Thursday for Kossuth County to make state resources available for cleanup and containment efforts around the outbreak. 
As livestock producers enter a fourth year dealing with the virus, which has also impacted dairy cattle, federal lawmakers have called for a poultry vaccine, and Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig has announced plans to introduce a state farm policy bill that would include provisions to help IDALS respond to outbreaks. 
In the meantime, IDALS advises backyard and commercial poultry producers to continue exercising heightened biosecurity protocols and to contact their veterinarian if they suspect any birds are sick with the virus. 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rate the public health risk of the bird flu as low. Currently, there is no known spread of the flu from person to person, though there have been 71 confirmed cases of the flu in humans who contracted the virus after being in contact with sick animals.

BARRE — The former leader of a nonprofit economic development organization has denied a charge accusing her of embezzling more than $70,000 from the group.
A charging document filed ahead of Thursday’s arraignment for Melissa Bounty also provided new details into what authorities say she spent the money on. 
“She was making weekly purchases from Amazon which were not received at the office but instead being delivered directly to her home address,” the filing stated.

“She was dining out at various restaurants throughout the region in the evenings and on weekends which would not have aligned with any business meetings or other business events,” the filing added. 
Bounty, 42, of Waitsfield, entered a not guilty plea to the single felony count through her attorney Thursday during a brief arraignment in Washington County Superior criminal court in Barre. 
Judge Daniel Richardson imposed several conditions on Bounty, including that she not contact certain staff and board members of the Central Vermont Economic Development Corporation, the organization she is accused of embezzling from when she served as its executive director.
Washington County Deputy State’s Attorney Corina Olteanu said in court Thursday that the investigation remained “ongoing.”
The court appearance was the first for Bounty since the Montpelier Police Department announced in December it had issued her a criminal citation for the alleged embezzlement following a monthslong investigation.
Police released few details at that time into the probe other than to say Bounty allegedly embezzled more than $70,000 from the organization, where she worked as executive director from 2022 to 2025.
Montpelier Police Detective Alesha Donovan wrote in the 22-page charging affidavit filed ahead of Thursday’s hearing that officials with the economic development group contacted authorities in July reporting that they believed that Bounty had embezzled from the organization and had been placed on leave. 
The filing stated that Bounty had embezzled $71,151 between March 2023 and July 1, 2025,  and that an employee at the organization had “grown suspicious” of certain financial transactions.
The transactions, according to the filing, were payments to an account belonging to Bounty’s husband.
Through researching financial records, Donovan added, authorities concluded that Bounty used the organization’s credit card to pay for personal expenses. In addition, Donovan wrote, investigators believe Bounty also paid her husband more than $42,283 with money from the organization.
According to the court filing, Bounty said the payments to her husband, Nermin Elezovic, were for work he had done as a contractor for the organization.
However, Heather Hurlbert, the organization’s interim executive director, told police that had Bounty’s husband been a contractor, there would have been a contract and tax documents. Neither of those were on file, Donovan wrote. 
Authorities also claimed that Bounty “regularly” used the organization’s credit card for personal groceries, dining out, personal shopping expenses, “luxury” car rentals and other non-business related expenses, the court filing stated.
The nonprofit organization, which receives state and federal funds to help promote and support local businesses, is one of 12 regional development corporations across the state. 
The embezzlement charge carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
Bounty and her attorney, Brooks McArthur, both declined comment following the hearing. Jon Valsangiacomo, an attorney for the organization’s board of directors, also declined comment after the hearing.

HOLLAND TWP. — A fight between unidentified officers and a man that drew local law enforcement to a Holland Township street Monday morning has been confirmed to be an immigration enforcement arrest.
The incident occurred at approximately 8:30 a.m. near 993 Butternut Drive. According to the Ottawa County Sheriff’s Office, the department dispatched deputies to the scene following 911 reports of “unknown officers” fighting with a man.


The initial emergency call was placed by a bystander whom the officers on-site had specifically asked to contact local authorities due to the “combative” nature of the subject, officials said.


One bystander was reportedly recording the arrest by phone.

By the time a sheriff’s deputy arrived, the individual had already been taken into custody. The deputy identified the personnel on the scene as agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.


Federal authorities confirmed they were executing an arrest based on an existing federal warrant.
“Once confirming everyone was safe, our deputy cleared the scene,” the Sheriff’s Office said in a statement released following the incident.
The encounter briefly sparked questions regarding the level of cooperation between local and federal authorities.
However, the statement by the sheriff’s office indicated its presence was strictly a response to a call for service regarding a physical altercation in progress.
“The sheriff’s office is not and has not been involved in any ‘Immigration Enforcement Operations in West Michigan,'” the statement read.
ICE officials have not yet released the identity of the individual taken into custody or the specific nature of the federal warrant.
 Rising number of ICE arrests in Michigan

By Oct. 15, 2025, ICE had arrested 2,349 people in Michigan — more than double the 952 arrests in 2024, MLive reported.
Nationally, ICE arrested 225,757 people through mid-October last year, also doubling the previous year’s numbers. The agency started making more community arrests instead of relying solely on a pipeline of detaining immigrants caught at local jails, the Washington Post reported.
Michigan data shows that about a quarter of last year’s arrests (593) were categorized as “ERO (Enforcement and Removal Operations) Street Arrest,” MLive reported. That’s up from 58 labeled as such in 2024. Others are tagged with general locations such as Grand Rapids, Detroit and Flint.

Mike Rounds formally announced Thursday that he will seek reelection this year, launching a bid for a third six-year term representing South Dakota in Washington, D.C. 
In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight, Rounds said “our work is not done yet,” pointing to priorities like cutting taxes, improving agricultural markets, preparations tied to the new B-21 bomber’s impending arrival at Ellsworth Air Force Base, and continued growth of the underground research laboratory at the former Homestake Mine in the Black Hills. 
The 71-year-old Rounds said his focus is on making South Dakota a place where young people “stay and raise their own families.” The former two-term governor was sworn in to the U.S. Senate in January 2015 and won reelection in 2020.

Rounds said he is a “Reagan Republican that votes with President Trump 99% of the time.” 
Recently, that included voting against advancing a war powers resolution that would have stopped President Donald Trump from taking further military action against Venezuela without congressional authorization. Earlier this month, U.S. special forces apprehended Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, from their bedroom during a surprise overnight raid. The couple was wanted by U.S. authorities on federal drug and conspiracy charges.
“When that war powers act was brought in, and when it was voted on, we did not have any boots on the ground in Venezuela,” Rounds said. “And in this particular case, it was our military helping in a law enforcement action down there, specifically with regard to trying to go after drug dealers and folks that were promoting crime in the United States of America.  
Rounds added that “South Dakota is safer because of what we’re doing down there to stop drugs from trafficking, not just into the United States, but into other countries that then move them on into our country as well.”
The 2026 race is drawing challengers. Justin McNeal, a Rapid City businessman, has announced his intention to challenge Rounds in the Republican primary election. Democrat Julian Beaudion, a Sioux Falls businessman and former state trooper, is running for his party’s nomination, and independent candidate Brian Bengs of Hot Springs has also announced a bid.

Free.,Many Dems refuse to vote to fund ICE as US House passes 4 spending bills,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/many-dems-refuse-vote-fund-ice-us-house-passes-4-spending-bills,,"WASHINGTON — The House Thursday passed four appropriations bills to fund the government and avert a partial shutdown, but Democrats largely objected to spending on the Department of Homeland Security amid aggressive immigration enforcement in communities across the country. Democrats have pushed for tougher oversight of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. In addition, members of the progressive wing of the caucus vowed to not approve any funding for DHS after federal immigration agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis earlier this month. The 37-year-old mother’s death led to massive community protests and  thousands of ICE agents have aggressively descended into Minnesota.“(Homeland Security Secretary) Kristi Noem and ICE are out of control,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement. “Taxpayer dollars are being misused to brutalize U.S. citizens, including the tragic killing of Renee Nicole Good. This extremism must end.” The four bills — Defense; Homeland Security; Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; and Transportation, Housing and Urban Development — are the last remaining appropriations bills needed to avoid a partial government shutdown by Jan. 30. The Homeland Security funding bill passed 220-207. The remaining bills passed 341-88.Democrats who joined Republicans in voting for the Homeland Security bill included Reps. Jared Gold of Maine, Henry Cuellar of Texas, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington state, Tom Suozzi of New York, Don Davis of North Carolina, Laura Gillen of New York and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas.Republican Thomas Massie of Kentucky voted against the DHS funding bill.Separately, GOP Rep. Virginia Foxx, chairwoman of the Rules Committee, added a provision to repeal a law that allows members of the U.S. Senate to sue for up to half a million dollars if their phone records were obtained by special counsel Jack Smith during his investigation into President Donald Trump’s efforts to subvert the 2020 presidential election. In a rare move, the provision passed unanimously. Smith was also on Capitol Hill Thursday to testify about his investigation before lawmakers on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The Senate will take up the appropriations bills when senators return from recess next week.What does the Homeland Security bill include?The Homeland Security bill provides $64.4 billion in funding for fiscal year 2026. It cuts funding for Customs and Border Protection by $1.3 billion, and maintains flat funding for ICE at $10 billion.The bill attempts to put guardrails around immigration enforcement by allocating $20 million for body cameras for ICE and CBP officers. It also requires DHS to provide monthly updates on how the agency is spending the $190 billion it received from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” the president’s signature tax and spending cuts package signed into law last summer.  The bill also restricts ICE to spending only $3.8 billion of its fiscal budget on detention. However, the agency will still be able to pull $75 billion from OBBBA, including for detention.Most Dems say they can’t back any ICE fundingDuring Thursday’s debate of the bill, Republicans supported the Homeland Security bill, and argued that it contains other agencies beside immigration enforcement. But a majority of Democrats said they could not vote to approve the agency’s funding because of ICE’s actions.“I think we should look at the bill in its totality,” GOP Appropriations Chair Tom Cole of Oklahoma said. “Encouraging people to believe we have massive bad actors in a particular agency… comparing law enforcement officers to the Gestapo or Nazis, that’s not true. The right thing to do is to fund the people who protect America.”Foxx criticized Democrats for their concerns over ICE enforcement tactics. On the House floor, she defended the agency, arguing that “ICE agents are arresting some of the worst criminals imaginable.”“The issue is that ICE is terrorizing communities and attacking people, including U.S. citizens,” countered the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, Jim McGovern of Massachusetts. “This is an out-of-control agency at war with communities across the country and they don't give a damn that you are a U.S. citizen.”The top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, said he could not support voting for the bill because the Trump administration has weaponized the agency and “DHS has strayed from its core mission.”“Republicans in control of Congress, however, are conducting zero oversight and do nothing but send blank check after blank check to DHS,” he said in a statement. “I have consistently supported the DHS workforce over the past two decades and continue to do so, but I cannot – in good conscience – vote to send another dime to CBP and ICE as they terrorize our communities and sully the constitution.”Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said she will vote against the bill, even though she is proud of several provisions, such as the increase to Federal Emergency Management Agency funding and a pay raise for air traffic controllers. But, she said, “It is impossible to ignore the impact ICE has had.”“ICE is an agency that has shown itself to be lawless,” she said.Republicans tout body camera provisionGOP Rep. Mark Amodei of Nevada, the chair of the panel that deals with funding for Homeland Security, defended the funding bill, and noted that it provides immigration officers with body cameras. He said funds are also provided in the measure for the Coast Guard and agencies dealing with cybersecurity. Cuellar of Texas, the top Democrat on that same panel, acknowledged that “this bill is not perfect.” “It's better than the alternative, leaving the department with a blank check,” he said. “This bill flat funds ICE but at the same time, we strengthen oversight of ICE.”Minnesota Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum said the ICE enforcement in Minnesota and across the country is one of the “worst cases of civil rights violations by the federal government in recent history.”   “Minnesotans are being racially profiled on a mass scale, assaulted on our streets, kidnapped from our communities,” she said.",,,,2026-01-22 17:36:30.145621

VTDigger/Vermont Public confirmed that seven extreme cold weather shelter locations will be open over the weekend. Most are part of a state-funded network of overflow shelters that activate when temperatures fall into the negatives as an attempt to save lives. You can find information on how to access those shelters below.
Other communities may open more informal shelters, too. Vermont Emergency Management suggests calling your town office to ask about local warming centers or to call 2-1-1 to find a facility near you. 
Bennington
Bennington’s extreme cold shelter is located at 200 Pleasant St., at St. Peter’s Episcopal Church.
It will be operating on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, according to Roxanne Carelli, executive director of operational development and shelter services at Bennington County Coalition for the Homeless.
The shelter will be open from 6:30 p.m. to 7 a.m. each night.
The space has capacity for 35 people.
Adults, families, and unaccompanied minors are allowed, according to Carelli. Sex offenders will not be admitted. Well-behaved pets will be allowed.

The shelter will be open from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m.
It has space for 15 people. 
Only adults are allowed, and pets must be registered as service animals to be admitted, DeAngelis said.
Burlington
Burlington’s extreme cold shelter is located at the Miller Center in the city’s New North End neighborhood, at 130 Gosse Court.
The shelter will open for four consecutive nights – Friday night through Monday night – according to a press release from Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak. 
The shelter will open at 5 p.m. and close at 8 a.m. each day. It has a capacity for 100 people.
Only adults will be admitted, and pets are allowed. Transportation will be provided from several locations in the city’s core to the shelter: 95 North Ave. (COTS Daystation), 228 N.

(Photo via Google Earth)An Iowa school teacher who was fired for printing a T-shirt with a suggestive comment on it is entitled to jobless benefits, a judge has ruled.
State records indicate Nancy Duncan, a high school science teacher for the Waukee Community School District, owned and operated a side business making custom, made-to-order T-shirts for customers.
At some point last year, a student’s parents contacted Duncan and asked her to make a shirt for their graduating child that said, “You, my friend, should’ve been swallowed.” The shirt was given to the graduating student during their graduation party in May 2025.

That same month, the school district fielded a complaint from a parent listing a series of inappropriate statements Duncan had allegedly made to students. At that point, the district also became aware that Duncan had made an inappropriate T-shirt for a student.
According to state records, Duncan met with her superiors and denied ever making the alleged statements to students, but was placed on administrative leave while the district investigated. As part of that investigation, a district official allegedly took the list of statements attributed to Duncan and recited them to Duncan’s students, asking whether Duncan had actually made the comments.
According to the district, some of the students indicated Duncan had made the comments – but at a subsequent hearing on the matter, district officials did not provide the specific details as to when the statements were made, which of them had been confirmed by the students, or the context of the statements.
The allegation regarding the T-shirt was confirmed by the district when the graduating student wore the shirt during the check-out process on their final day of school. According to state records, the parents who had commissioned the T-shirt offered to explain the situation to Waukee administrators, but district officials were unwilling to discuss the matter.
At some point during the investigation, a human resources worker for the district told Duncan’s union representative that the investigation was not going well for Duncan and the district was planning to fire her due to the T-shirt incident unless she agreed to resign first.
In early June, Duncan and the district entered into a negotiated separation agreement, which provided Duncan with regular wages and benefits through Aug. 31, 2025, plus a $5,000 lump sum payment, in return for her resignation. As part of that written agreement, the district stipulated that it had agreed “not to contest any claim” by Duncan for unemployment compensation.
In September, however, Duncan applied to Iowa Workforce Development for unemployment benefits, and the district contested her claim. That led to an initial fact-finding hearing, and then to a December 2025 hearing before Administrative Law Judge Carly Smith, who recently ruled in Duncan’s favor and awarded her benefits.
In her decision, Smith ruled that Duncan’s “making the T-shirt for the graduating student was poor judgment” but did not rise to the level of disqualifying, job-related misconduct for the purpose of determining unemployment eligibility.
“The parents of the graduating student asked (Duncan) to make it for them as a gift since she has a business making custom T-shirts,” Smith noted. “This was not an unsolicited shirt that was given to the student through (Duncan’s) own initiative.”
As for the statements Duncan was alleged to have made to students, Smith said the district had relied upon “hearsay within hearsay to prove misconduct.” She noted that the complaining parent’s email lacked specific details of the purported statements, and that the district had offered no first-hand witnesses or signed statements to substantiate the allegations.
Smith ruled that because Duncan did not voluntarily resign her position and was essentially fired, and because the district lacked credible evidence to prove job-related misconduct, Duncan was entitled to jobless benefits.
District officials declined to comment on the case when contacted by the Iowa Capital Dispatch.
Duncan’s attorney, Nathan Arnold, said in a written statement, “We strongly support Iowa’s amazing teachers and their right to have a life outside of school. The school did not provide any supporting documents or testimony to establish employment misconduct and by law they have the burden to prove that claim. As such, like any Iowan, Nancy was able to collect unemployment benefits related to her termination of employment. That is why unemployment benefits exist. We thank Iowa Workforce for their wisdom, insight, and thoughtful consideration.”
Records show that in 2021, Duncan was the recipient of the Iowa Academy of Science’s Excellence in Science Teaching Award.

The group has published basic voter guides since 2018, but the 2026 version includes names of candidates running for federal, legislative, judicial and local offices, and important voting deadlines.
The guide, which Enlace Latino calls the “North Carolina electoral map,” links to the North Carolina State Board of Elections online sample ballot form, so voters can find their choices for each race. 
The county-level information includes how many Latino voters live there, which is intended to aid voter outreach efforts.  
“As part of our civic education efforts and as a tool for Latino voters, we always try to develop this type of resource that is practical, educational and accessible,”  Enlace Latino cofounder Walter Gomez said in an interview. 
“We know the voting process can be difficult, not only for the Latino community, but also for many other people, for citizens in the United States,” he said.
The site is nonpartisan, Gomez said, and is meant to help voters no matter which candidates they choose. 
Latino voter registration in North Carolina has more than doubled over the last 10 years, and now stands at 4.5% of total registrants. But turnout of Latino voters has lagged behind other groups.
About 56% of Latino voters cast ballots in the 2024 general election, while turnout was more than 78% for white voters, nearly 68% for Asian American voters, and 66% for Black voters, according to the state Board of Elections. 
Elections are often decided by very few votes, Gomez said, which is why increased voter participation is important and why Enlace Latino is working toward that goal.

ICE activity may be a variable affecting voter turnout. Immigration officers’ sweeps through North Carolina cities last year led to increased absences from school and work as people feared leaving their homes.
“Yes, there is a real cause for concern,” Gomez said. “The increase in ICE activity can become a disruptive factor that discourages many Latino U.S. citizens” from exercising their right to vote.
“In a context where being Latino and speaking Spanish already exposes some people to discrimination, the fear of being questioned, intimidated, or even mistaken for undocumented individuals can generate fear and self-censorship,” he said, “At some polling places, Latino voters may face verbal aggression, harassment, or a lack of adequate protection, creating an unsafe environment for participation.
“The outcome is troubling: when fear enters the electoral process, democracy is weakened, because not all voices feel free to participate on equal terms,” he said.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)While Florida’s top GOP leaders now all say they expect to put just one constitutional amendment on the ballot this fall on cutting property taxes, a joint resolution approved by a House committee Thursday is now set to go to the full House — the second such joint resolution to pass all of its assigned committees in the chamber this session.
The House Ways and Means Committee approved on a party-line vote a resolution (HJR 203) that would gradually increase the homestead exemption for non-school-related property taxes by $100,000 each year for 10 years.
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Monique Miller, R-Palm Bay, said last week that one of the attractions of her proposal is that it wouldn’t inflict an immediate shock to local governments when it comes to a reduction in revenues, because it will be spread out for up to 10 years before fully taking affect. But she also boasted that it would provide tax relief to homesteaded property owners much sooner than that.
“Given that the median home price is about $350,000, most Floridians will have zero non-school ad valorem property taxes by 2030,” Miller told the State House Affairs Committee last week.
That prompted Rep. Robin Bartleman, D-Weston, to essentially repeat that prediction, saying that with the median home price in Florida between $300,000 and $400,000, more than 300 cities in the state will not be able to collect any property taxes after just three years.
“The fact that you’re putting it on the ballot that it’s 10 years when in reality by like year four or five by just doing the math they will all be phased out,” she said. “Is that fair to do to the voters, because 10 years is a reasonable glide path but, in reality, that glide path is shortened because of the home values.”
Miller acknowledged that some cities could be “phased out” of collecting any property taxes after just three years.
Local government officials fire back
The public comment period of the meeting featured local government officials who traveled to Tallahassee to say that the idea of severely reducing or eliminating property taxes would be hugely detrimental to their residents.
George Kruse, a Republican commissioner from Manatee County, argued it is untrue to say all citizens want lower taxes. Manatee voters, he said, have consistently approved tax increases on the ballot in recent years for the school district, fire districts, and environmental needs.
“They just want smart use of tax and it’s up to us to determine how best to do that, and if we don’t that, every two years they get to vote half of us out, every four years they get to vote all of us out,” Kruse said.
Another elected Republican, Pasco County Commissioner Jack Mariano, said that none of the proposed constitutional amendments filed by House Republicans regarding property taxes makes sense.
“We’ve looked at every one of them and they’re all disastrous for us,” he said.
According to a spreadsheet Mariano shared with the Phoenix, Pasco County would take an immediate 21% revenue loss in the first year after the amendment (if approved) would go into effect, increasing to as much as 45% by the fifth year of the 10-year phaseout.
Mariano referred to how Pasco voters have approved a “Penny for Pasco” one-cent sales tax on three different occasions, because it has helped fund parks, libraries, bike trails, and other amenities the community wants.
Nicole Wilson, a commissioner from Orange County, noted the resolution prohibits curbing the budgets for police and fire fighters, but does nothing about preserving funding for infrastructure. “Emergency response — not just the firefighters, paramedics, and law enforcement or 911 — need to be there when they call for help, but they need to be able to get there, and that’s infrastructure,” she said. 
Miller’s resolution is the second property tax proposal that has passed all of its assigned committees in the House. A resolution (HJR 209) sponsored by Rep. Demi Busatta, R-Coral Gables, would create an exemption from non-school property taxes for $200,000 of a homestead property’s assessed value as long as the property is insured. It has already been added to the House calendar for consideration by the full chamber.
However, whether the resolution ultimately goes to the voters as a constitutional amendment is unknown at this time. Neither Busatta’s nor Miller’s resolutions have companions in the Florida Senate. A joint resolution must be approved by three-fifths of both chambers to qualify for the November ballot.
And House Speaker Daniel Perez recently joined with Gov. Ron DeSantis and Senate President Ben Albritton in saying it probably would better that only one such tax-related constitutional amendment go before the voters later this year. It would require 60% voter approval to become law.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/0-2-2-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-22 17:36:30.145621

(Photo by Erik Gunn /Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin job growth has been slowing over the last year, new data published Thursday suggests.
Total nonfarm jobs in Wisconsin rose by 9,000 in December compared with November, the Department of Workforce Development reported. When compared with December 2024, however, the increase amounted to 6,700 — suggesting a “cooling and holding pattern” in the state’s economy, said Scott Hodek, section chief in the department’s Office of Economic Advisors, during a media briefing Thursday.
“We’ve seen it cool a little, and that’s following national trends,” Hodek said. “There’s been a fair amount of volatility and uncertainty in the national economy, and of course that impacts Wisconsin as well.”
Earlier this month Groundwork Collaborative, a Washington D.C. progressive economic policy think tank, described the national December jobs report in grim terms.
“The December report caps a year of sluggish job growth, with the fewest number of jobs added outside of a recession since 2003,” Groundwork stated in a Jan. 9 press release. “Hiring slowed sharply over the course of 2025.”
The organization’s analysis put much of the blame on tariffs imposed by the administration of President Donald Trump and the accompanying uncertainty amid federal policy gyrations.
In Wisconsin, while jobs are in decline, three-month trends in separations and layoffs have “stayed pretty stable,” Hodek said Thursday.
“People are just essentially staying in jobs longer and you’re not seeing a lot of necessarily separations, but not necessarily a lot of hiring either,” Hodek said.
Job numbers have fallen in manufacturing and some parts of the service sector. There were 1,100 fewer manufacturing jobs reported in December than in November, and 3,800 fewer than in December 2024. Professional services jobs declined in December by 3,700 compared with November, and by 6,200 compared with December 2024.
Construction jobs increased by 3,100 in December compared with November 2025 and by 5,100 compared with December 2024. Leisure and hospitality gained 4,700 jobs in December compared with November and 10,900 jobs compared with December 2024. The number of health care jobs increased by 1,700 from November to December and by 10,900 from December 2024.
Jobs numbers in the monthly report are projections drawn from a federal survey of employer payrolls.
From a separate federal survey of households that asks whether people are working or actively seeking work, DWD has projected that 65,500 fewer Wisconsin residents were employed in December 2025 compared with December 2024. The state’s unemployment rate remained even with the previous month at 3.1%
The data aren’t granular enough to establish to what extent retirements account for the decrease in the number of employees, Hodek said. But he added that the “overall aging population,” the absence of a surge in unemployment insurance claims  and some other data “would back up this assertion that a fair number of those have to be retirees.”

That will 'come at a significant cost to customers,' the company said.","Eversource pressed state officials on Thursday to reach a settlement with the utility that would allow for quicker recovery of deferred storm costs that have grown to nearly $1 billion.
The request came during a meeting before the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority regarding Eversource’s efforts to recoup costs associated with responding to dozens of “catastrophic” storms — events that cost the company at least $4 million each — between 2018 and 2023. 
The cost of the response to each storm, including everything from preparations to repairs to worker accommodations, is treated differently than smaller-storm costs that are recovered through base rates. 
“At this point in time, we know [it] needs to be dealt with, and it’s going to come at a significant cost to customers,” said Doug Horton, Eversource’s vice president of distribution rates and regulatory requirements.
Gov. Ned Lamont signed legislation last year that would allow utility companies to recover those storm costs from customers through a process known as securitization — essentially bundling the total amount into bonds that can be paid back over a longer period of time at lower interest rates. Eversource estimates that the process will save customers $6 to $7 a month compared to a shorter pay-back period.
To date, however, PURA has yet to give utilities companies the go-ahead to proceed with securitization under the new law. 
In order to do so, regulators must first determine how much of Eversource’s costs were prudently incurred and eligible for recovery from customers. Once that amount is determined, officials with the company say it will take a year or more to get final approval and issue the bonds.
Claire Coleman, who represents utility customers as the head of the Office of Consumer Counsel, said that while she is supportive of securitizing storm costs, she is also concerned that Eversource is putting pressure on PURA and other state agencies to rush their review of the company’s expenditures. 
“We really need to strike a balance between resolving these issues expeditiously, which I agree is in the best interest of customers,” Coleman said. “But if we do it too expeditiously, we’ll short-change them.”
More than three-quarters of the costs included within Eversource’s request stem from the hiring of outside crews to repair lines and clear fallen trees following storms.
The biggest points of disagreement between Coleman’s agency and Eversource has to do with $330 million in carrying charges that the company says it is owed after waiting years to recover its storm costs. Those charges continue to accrue at roughly $8 million a month, the company says, and would bring the total amount owed by customers to more than $1.5 billion. 
Coleman, however, argued that Eversource is not guaranteed recovery of those carrying charges until PURA is able to assess the prudency of its storm costs.
Adding to the pressure for a quick resolution of the question of how much Eversource is owed is the company’s plan to file a new rate case before PURA on June 1. Eversource’s Horton said that having clarity on the issue by then will allow recovery of those storm costs to be synchronized with the timing of new electric rates in mid-2027.
Horton also attributed the large backlog of unresolved storm costs to former PURA Chair Marissa Gillett, saying she repeatedly refused to rule on the company’s requests for payment and instead ordered them to settle the matter through a full rate case. Gillett stepped down in October, following a long and acrimonious dispute with the state’s utility companies and was replaced by four new commissioners. 
“We’re starting from a premise that we want to securitize as much as possible, as quickly as we can,” he said. 
In order to expedite that resolution, Eversource has proposed reaching a settlement with OCC, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and other state agencies over the amount of storm costs to be recovered. Any such settlement would have to be approved by PURA. 
In a presentation submitted to PURA’s commissioners ahead of Thursday’s meeting, the company said a settlement would provide the “optimal path to lower costs and bill impacts for customers.” In her own letter responding to that presentation, however, Coleman said it was “inappropriate” to use the Thursday’s meeting — which was to discuss scheduling matters — to press for a settlement. 
In addition, Coleman wrote that Eversource has yet to provide the state with an “updated” settlement proposal for the parties to discuss. (Coleman later declined to comment on settlement negotiations, citing confidentiality rules.)
One of the five PURA commissioners participating in Thursday’s meeting, Vice Chair David Arconti, endorsed the idea of a settlement as the quickest way of resolving the issue.
“I do think that’s the most optimal path,” Arconti said. “I would encourage everybody and all of the parties to keep working hard toward that best outcome.” 
His comments came after PURA’s acting chairman, Tom Wiehl, said the agency is constrained by its current workload — which includes several active rate cases — and that its staff is working nights and weekends on the securitization issue. 
“I don’t know that this agency’s active docket caseload has ever been more overloaded than it is right now,” Wiehl said. 
Eversource’s last settlement before PURA resulted in the company agreeing to pay a $103 million penalty for its much-criticized response to Tropical Storm Isaias, which left hundreds of thousands of customers without power for nearly a week in 2020.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP21274801266388-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-22 16:56:29.511821

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)FRANKFORT — On the 53rd anniversary of Roe v. Wade, Kentucky advocates said barriers to abortion in the state “cost lives.” 
A Lexington Democrat and representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky and Planned Parenthood’s Kentucky chapter blamed abortion restrictions for the state’s poor maternal health, HPV and cervical cancer and health care provider shortages. 
Jackie McGranahan, a policy strategist with the ACLU of Kentucky, said she wants to see the “cycle of shame” around abortion end, and shared publicly that she once got an abortion. 
“I had a son and a daughter before my 21st birthday,” said McGranahan. “I was in college and working full time. My partner was also in school. Our family depended on my income, and when I became pregnant again, it was not an exciting time. I was filled with fear, anxiety and financial insecurity that causes fear and constant stress. The decision to have an abortion was the right decision for myself and my family. That was more than 20 years ago, and I do not regret it.”

McGranahan and others spoke in the Democratic Caucus Room in the Capitol Annex. Tamarra Wieder, Kentucky state director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, said the state’s abortion restrictions “undermine the entire health care system.” 
“This is what criminalization of care looks like in real life: forcing pregnant people to travel farther, fewer doctors, fewer options, more risk,” she said. Preventative care saves lives; barriers cost lives.” 
Wieder also said abortion access is about “freedom from government overreach” and called lawmakers who established the ban “extremist politicians.”  
“Pregnancy can be dangerous, especially in environments where people are forced to carry pregnancies without full medical options,” McGranahan said. “Lawmakers should not have the authority to force someone to remain pregnant against their will.” 
The political climate for an uphill fight 
Rep. Lindsey Burke, D-Lexington, has tried for the past few years to undo Kentucky’s trigger law, which went into effect when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022 and banned most abortions in the commonwealth. 
This year, her House Bills 22 and 23 would reset abortion access to where it was before the trigger law and outline privacy protections for people who go out of state for abortions or take medication to induce an abortion. Before the trigger law, Kentuckians could get abortions up until 20 weeks gestation. 
Burke has acknowledged the steep uphill battle any abortion measure has in the Republican controlled legislature — bills introduced in recent years from both Republicans and Democrats to add abortion exceptions for rape and incest have effectively died on arrival. 
Senate President Robert Stivers has expressed support for quick and harsh penalties on those who rape, saying it’s “tough” when there is “trauma” from incest or rape: “That’s where it gets (to be a) hard decision.” 
“While I think the overarching sentiment of the supermajority has not changed, I do think that the current political climate has changed, as we’ve seen Kentucky women going to jail and potentially to prison,” Burke said. “We know that it’s not me crying wolf when I say that Kentucky women are in danger. It’s not just the unintended consequences of negative medical outcomes. It’s also the criminalization and punishment of women for exercising their right and control over their own body that continues to motivate me to file these bills.” 
Burke pointed to a recent case in Wolfe County in which a woman was initially charged with fetal homicide after police said she took medicine for an abortion. The fetal homicide charge was later dropped, but the case “did confirm the fear” Burke has around punitive abortion laws, she said. 
“We know that there are people who zealously believe in (the) right to life, and they’re willing to hurt and punish anyone in order to effectuate their beliefs, and they’re willing to take advantage of loopholes and gray areas in the legal system to do that, and that’s what we saw play out in Wolfe County,” Burke said. 
She has shared publicly about her complicated journey to motherhood, including a $50,000 loan to pay for in vitro fertilization treatments, miscarriage and dilation and curettage, a procedure to remove tissue from the uterus. 
Burke has polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, a hormone problem which can cause infertility and affects around 5 million Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“This is not about politics. It’s about people,” Burke said. “It’s about making sure that no woman in Kentucky has to weigh her health against her freedom and her future against an unclear or punitive law. I file these bills because protecting women from criminalization is not radical. It’s responsible, it’s humane and it’s long overdue.”

“What we don’t have in Mississippi is the gold standard kind of cancer program that is available in other places in the country,” said Dr. LouAnn Woodward, vice chancellor for health affairs and dean of the UMMC School of Medicine, during the Senate appropriations committee Wednesday.
The medical center is asking the state Legislature to appropriate $100 million to go toward the new building’s $250 million overall cost. The project also has the support of U.S. Sens. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Roger Wicker and U.S. Rep. Michael Guest, who are seeking approximately $40 million in federal funding for the cancer center, Woodward said. The remaining costs will be financed through bonds issued by the medical center.
The five-story building will be located on State Street across from the medical center and “bring together education, research and treatment under one roof,” according to the project’s fundraising website. The building will be adjacent to the American Cancer Center’s Jackson Hope Lodge, which provides a free place to stay to cancer patients and their families. 
The new building is critical to the UMMC Cancer Center and Research Institute’s application for designation by the National Cancer Institute, a federal agency run by the National Institutes of Health, Woodward said. The institute recognizes cancer centers that meet rigorous requirements for laboratory and clinical research and translate scientific knowledge into innovative treatments for patients. It also provides training for the next generation of cancer-care professionals and performs outreach to the community. 
There are 73 NCI designated centers nationwide, but none in Mississippi, Louisiana or Arkansas. Cancer patients in Mississippi seeking care at a designated center must travel to Alabama, Tennessee or Texas. The designation was first introduced in the 1970s as a part of a national initiative to increase Americans’ access to cutting-edge cancer treatment. 
Achieving the designation will be a “long, heavy lift,” that could take up to a decade, Dr. Rodney Rocconi, the director of UMMC’s cancer center since 2023, previously told Mississippi Today. It will require the center to recruit faculty, expand its research capacity and demonstrate strong programming in community outreach and prevention.
Designated centers receive a support grant from the agency and have access to early clinical trials. Studies have shown that patients treated at NCI-designated centers have lower mortality rates than people treated at non-designated cancer centers. 
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Mississippi, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mississippi’s cancer death rate is 25% higher than the national average.
UMMC, the state’s only academic medical center, is the only institution in Mississippi capable of achieving NCI designation because a successful application requires a high level of research horsepower, Woodward said to the Senate appropriations committee Wednesday. 
“It’s either us, or it doesn’t happen,” she said. 
The state Legislature increased its appropriation for the cancer center to $9 million in 2024 – a nearly $5 million increase — to support research infrastructure, clinical trials and recruiting researchers.
The medical center is currently recruiting cancer researchers “as fast as we can,” Woodward said Wednesday. 
The University of Mississippi Medical Center has sought National Cancer Institute designation since 2012, a process it then expected to take five years, the Jackson Free Press reported at the time.
UMMC has received several sizable donations for the cancer center, and donations have outpaced the medical center’s internal schedule, said Woodward. John and Sandy Black of Madison donated $25 million to support the new facility last January. 
“The enthusiasm that we are meeting for this project is phenomenal,” Woodward said. 
The medical center has discussed the application process with the National Cancer Institute, Woodward said. The institute will not give UMMC a pass on any requirements, but they have been “exceedingly encouraging” of Mississippi’s efforts, Woodward said.

The move by the governor comes a day after WyoFile reported that the board was planning to mount a legal challenge against another state agency.
The post Gordon quashes Board of Equalization lawsuit against property tax cap appeared first on WyoFile .","Gov. Mark Gordon directed the State Board of Equalization not to file a lawsuit challenging a tax cap on residential property, he announced Thursday. 
“It is clear to me that the mere filing of such a suit at this time will only be more confusing to taxpayers and cause concern with the county assessor’s process,” Gordon said in a statement. “Assessors already have a complicated enough task with the array of tax exemptions passed each year.”
WyoFile reported Wednesday that the board was preparing to file a lawsuit against the Department of Revenue in which it would argue the law was unconstitutional. 
WyoFile obtained documents on Thursday indicating how close the board was to filing a suit, including a 21-page legal complaint and a drafted press release dated Jan. 20. The documents also indicated that attorneys Catherine Young and Amanda Esch of Davis and Cannon had been hired to represent the board. 
“Because of its constitutional and statutory duties, the State Board was compelled to act,” the draft press release states in part. “It filed this action to ensure that property taxation is administered in a uniform, equal, and lawful manner for all taxpayers across the state.”
With near-unanimous support in both the House and Senate, lawmakers passed the measure in 2024 as part of a slate of bills intended to provide tax relief to homeowners. Structured as an exemption, the law caps annual residential property tax increases at 4%, even if the real estate’s value grows at a higher rate. 
“I and many others remain confident that the 4% cap passed by the legislature and signed by me in 2024 is constitutional,” Gordon wrote. “I believe this is the right decision for the people of Wyoming.”
In 2024, Wyoming voters approved a constitutional amendment to separate residential property into its own tax class. Gordon encouraged lawmakers to “craft legislation” around the amendment. 
He also encouraged eligible homeowners to apply for “all property tax exemptions,” including a 25% exemption, which has an application window closing March 1. 
The State Board of Equalization is in the Wyoming Constitution, which tasks the three-person body with the responsibility “to equalize the valuation on all property in several counties and such other duties as may be prescribed by law.” 
Most of the board’s time is devoted to resolving disputes between taxpayers and the Department of Revenue, and reviewing appeals from decisions of county boards of equalization that adjudicate disputes between taxpayers and their county assessors, according to its website. Members of the board are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate. 
Board Vice-Chairman Marty Hardsocg told WyoFile Thursday that the problem that prompted a drafted complaint remains and needs to be resolved. 
The drafted complaint sheds light on the difficulty the tax cap has placed on the board when it comes to ensuring uniformity. 
“These tax caps unfairly (and non-uniformly) shift the tax burden from owners of property whose values are rapidly increasing to other taxpayers not experiencing large value increases,” the complaint alleges. 
“Said differently, owners of residential real property who are experiencing slow or no property value growth — or, indeed, even those experiencing valuation decreases — are penalized with a disproportionate tax burden, while other owners of rapidly appreciating residential real property pay a lower amount of tax per dollar of actual value.” 
This is a breaking news story and may be updated.

(Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA — Facing rising inflation and population growth, legislators and transportation officials are considering adding toll lanes to highways as a way of increasing revenue and reducing congestion.
Federal law prohibits states from putting toll booths on existing highway lanes that receive any federal money. Any proposal that did so likely wouldn’t be very popular among legislators, anyway, Secretary of Transportation Justin Powell told a panel of senators Thursday.
What the Department of Transportation could do, however, is add new lanes with tolls, often referred to as “choice lanes.” A bill introduced this week by Senate Transportation Chairman Larry Grooms would allow the Department of Transportation to do that, as long as the intention was to reduce traffic.
Under existing law, the DOT can’t add tolls to any highways unless the Legislature passes a law telling it to do so. Money from tolls has to go toward paying construction or maintenance costs on the road where the toll booth sits.
“Certainly, to have that expanded and allowed would be a very important item for us to do,” Powell told the subcommittee Thursday.
SC governor asks legislators to spend $1.1B more on roadwork as inflation drives up costs

It was the panel’s first meeting on the bill, which was mostly a presentation from Powell. Senators took no vote.
South Carolina has only one toll road, a 16-mile stretch of Interstate 185 south of Greenville. A second toll road on Hilton Head Island stopped collecting fees in 2021 after the revenues collected over 23 years paid off the money used to build the road.
Under the “choice lane” proposal, existing lanes would remain free, but drivers could “pay their way out of congestion,” Powell said. Details of any potential tolls, including how much they might cost and where they might go, remain up in the air. Just over the South Carolina border, Charlotte uses similar lanes.
Increases in construction costs mean money doesn’t go as far as it once did, Powell said. Costs for major projects skyrocketed in recent years, and the state’s gas tax doesn’t stretch as far as it did before, he said Thursday, reiterating concerns he told the governor in a December letter.
Gov. Henry McMaster asked legislators to spend an additional $1.1 billion on road and bridge projects this year to keep up with inflation as part of his executive budget request.
Optional toll booths could help supplement whatever funding the department receives, bringing in more revenue for the agency that could allow it to speed along planned road projects, Powell said.
As the state’s population booms, much of the DOT’s work in recent years has focused on expanding interstates to keep traffic flowing. Adding toll booths to new lanes could be a cheaper way to widen interstates and accomplish the same goal, Powell said.
The agency is considering improvements to Interstate 526 between Mount Pleasant and West Ashley to reduce traffic around North Charleston. But that project could cost around $7 billion. Powell said the agency was not ready Thursday to give details about it.
Adding “choice lanes” on I-526 and I-26 “has the potential to not only reduce travel times for folks willing to pay the toll significantly,” Powell said. “It also has the potential to reduce the travel times for people in the free lanes at a rate greater than what we’re contemplating with the $7 billion project, and likely at less out-of-pocket to the state.”
Charleston could be a prime candidate, since it’s the state’s “biggest area for congestion right now,” Powell said. Other fast-growing areas, such as Greenville and Myrtle Beach, may also benefit from tolls.
Toll roads are never popular, said Sen. Ed Sutton, a Charleston Democrat.
“But you’ve got to pay for roads somehow,” Sutton added.
One way of doing that would be raising the gas tax, which is unlikely. Legislators last approved raising the tax in 2017, and that compromise took a decade of debate. The law increased the tax by 12 cents over six years, to 28 cents a gallon.
Even at the local level, recent attempts to raise sales taxes to fund transportation projects within a county have died at the ballot box. With that in mind, Sutton said he’d support implementing tolls.
“Other options just aren’t working,” he said.
The bill floats several other ways of drawing in more revenue for road projects.
To offset increased traffic on the roads from people moving into the state, the bill proposes a $2,500 fee per single-family home in new subdivisions, or $1,500 per multi-family unit. The Department of Transportation would use that money for projects meant to reduce traffic in the county where the fee was paid. The idea is to offset the influx of new residents, Powell said.
“I’m open to ideas and solutions that can deal with that issue without burdening the existing taxpayer with that growth,” Powell said.
While the gas tax is unlikely to rise, the bill would introduce a fee on public charging stations for electric vehicles.
South Carolina lags behind its southeastern neighbors in buying electric vehicles, but around 32,000 such cars are registered in the state. More EVs drive through on vacations or trips to other states, Powell said.

(Stock photo via Getty Images)A proposal requiring testing for Florida students’ cursive writing ability passed its second House committee Thursday, the last stop before it goes before the full House.
HB 127 would put in state law a requirement to test elementary students on their ability to write and read cursive.
“We’re in a digital age right now, and we’ve really lost sight of our foundational skills that connect us to our history and sharpen our minds. If our students can’t read cursive, they can’t read the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, or even a grandparent’s handwritten letter,” bill co-sponsor Rep. Dana Trabulsy told the House Education & Employment Committee. “Cursive writing isn’t just a skill, it’s a link to our heritage and a tool for lifelong learning.”
Existing state law does not require cursive writing, but State Board of Education curricula do. The board, however, does not require students to prove proficiency.
The state requires public schools to teach students how to write upper- and lower-case letters in third grade, consistently readable cursive in fourth grade, and, in fifth grade, to write as fast in cursive as they would writing print.
The bill would require that, by the end of fifth grade, “each student must demonstrate proficiency in cursive writing through an evaluation of written work.”
Proficiency is defined as writing upper- and lower-case letters, legibly writing words with proper spacing, and reading and writing essays and assignments in cursive.
“I think as we get into the AI era where we’re going to see a return to hand-testing, it’s super important, and I hope our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol will make this happen,” Rep. Judson Sapp, a Republicans from Green Cove Springs, said.
The identical Senate bill, SB 444 by Republican Sen. Erin Grall from Vero Beach, has three committees to pass before the whole Senate would vote on it. It has not been scheduled for any meetings yet.
Opponents of the bill last year questioned the need for more tests for students to have to take.
The bill has been attempted several times in previous years. Trabulsy said she tried to kill the bill in a previous legislative session, “because who writes cursive anymore?”
However, her bank teller told her that several bank customers simply sign an “X” instead of writing their unique signature. That story changed her mind, she said.
The bill passed the committee unanimously.

The agency has for decades struggled with funding shortages, and requests for Beacon Hill to infuse more cash to stave off service cuts or fare hikes are nothing new. More of the same might actually be welcome, but this time around, the ask could be even tougher.
Updated MBTA financial projections rolled out last week suggest the agency is once again careening toward a shortfall in the next 18-plus months. Making the situation more dire this time is the past year of economic sluggishness and a series of federal funding cuts, which together mean budget math for all of state government — not just the T — is even harder.
One watchdog thinks the “opportunity has sort of faded” for a more permanent funding solution, at least until after the 2026 elections. A task force Healey assigned with studying big-picture transportation funding questions last year concluded the state should lean on the existing surtax on high earners, stopping short of any new taxes and fees that might permanently alter the T’s budget-building outlook.
“Our window to fix this was last year, and we didn’t do it,” said Brian Kane, executive director of the MBTA Advisory Board, which represents cities and towns who help fund the T. “Now the economy has turned, and there’s a new president who’s screwing us on health care and putting a massive deficit in the state budget that has to get filled, which is why everything else has to take a haircut.”
Officials forecast the T, whose $3.24 billion budget increased spending more than 7 percent over the prior year, will end the current budget cycle $239 million in the red. They expect to be able to close that gap by drawing from the agency’s rainy-day fund, which lawmakers and Gov. Maura Healey replenished with $300 million in surtax funds last year.
That savings account would then have about $433 million left over for subsequent years, enough to cover most but not all of the projected $560 million shortfall in fiscal 2027 before a $732 million abyss looms in fiscal 2028.
There are a few factors behind the widening chasm. The T has long grappled with a fundamental mismatch between what it spends and what it brings in, and that’s been amplified by lower post-pandemic ridership as well as a significant increase in spending to staff up and improve service.
MBTA budget-writers also had higher hopes for state funding. Their budget, approved in early June, assumed that Beacon Hill would provide $687 million in so-called contract assistance, a sum that both Gov. Maura Healey and the House proposed.
However, the Senate instead pursued a lower investment, and the final state budget signed into law on July 4 provided the T only $470 million in contract assistance — a significant sum, but nearly a third less than the figure baked into the agency’s spending plan.
If Beacon Hill approves that same level in the next state budget, T officials forecast they will still run massive annual deficits that would need to be closed at some point down the road.
The T’s ever-upbeat general manager, Phil Eng, took a more sunny tone. In an interview with CommonWealth Beacon, Eng emphasized that the projections are “a snapshot in time” that could still change for the better, not a guarantee of a crisis.
Eng said he’s “very optimistic” the Legislature and Healey will maintain high levels of financial support for the T, especially after a fairly consistent period of improving reliability.
“We’ve demonstrated that transportation needs those investments, and I really do believe that despite all the challenges, the Legislature is going to find a way to balance all of the different competing needs,” he said.
MBTA leaders won’t get a final answer on state funding for several months. Healey will unveil her annual state spending proposal next week, and the House and Senate will reply with their own versions later in the spring.

It’s not clear how much money Healey plans to propose for the agency. Her spokesperson, Karissa Hand, said only that the forthcoming annual budget will aim to build on past progress and “continue to fill the T’s budget deficit.”
Top lawmakers say they want to continue to support the MBTA, and hope it can avoid any cost-cutting measures that would impact passengers.
“We have grown back ridership, and I think we’ve restored trust, so I certainly would want to do everything we can to avoid any service cuts or any fare [increases],” said Sen. Brendan Crighton, who co-chairs the Transportation Committee.
Still, Crighton acknowledged that state government is “definitely in a different climate” than it was when Healey and lawmakers weighed the last round of MBTA funding a year ago. Many more holes have erupted in the quilt of state spending that policymakers will want to stitch closed, likely shrinking the pool of resources available for the T.
The federal reconciliation law signed last year is set to decrease state tax collections by nearly $950 million over fiscal years 2026 and 2027 combined. The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation forecast federal funding for health care will plummet $532 million in fiscal 2026 and nearly $1.4 billion in fiscal 2027. Business groups also continue to push a ballot question that, if approved in November, would cut the state’s income tax rate by a percentage point, which officials say could carry an annual impact of $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion once fully implemented.
“That uncertainty — I think we’ve we felt it for the past year, particularly when you’re trying to craft a budget and constantly adjusting to some of the really poor decisions being made at the federal level,” Crighton, of Lynn, said. “It’s hard to predict, but I think we can say with confidence there’s a commitment to do everything we can to help [the T].”
His House counterpart, Rep. Jim Arciero of Westford, said lawmakers “will review the MBTA needs in the larger schema of transportation while also assessing the many other financial needs across the state.”
Budget chiefs in the Legislature and the Healey administration agreed last week to build the fiscal 2027 state budget on an estimate that tax growth will barely exceed inflation.
The MBTA has limited options available to close its budget gap, Kane said. While some tweaks such as spending less on contractors can help, to achieve major savings, the agency would likely need to cut service, lay off workers, or hike fares (or some combination).
The T has not raised subway fares since 2019 and has not raised bus fares since 2016. Transit advocates and even some officials tend to be squeamish about raising costs on commuters because it can disincentivize ridership.
Eng said “fare increases are not on the table.” His team’s focus is instead on ensuring all riders are paying, including with new commuter rail fare gates at South Station and additional gates set to be installed at Back Bay and Ruggles stations later this year.
Kane argued that shedding employees from current levels is a bad idea, noting that the Federal Transit Administration declared the MBTA’s previously low staffing to be a safety hazard.
He’s open, though, to the argument that the T doesn’t need to keep up such an aggressive pace of staffing expansion. Even the agency’s newest budget projections forecasting a shortfall call for adding another 1,000 positions in the next two years.
“At some point, we need to have a real adult conversation and say, ‘Can we afford this?’ The answer right now is no,” Kane said. “The T has staffed up significantly in the last two years. Maybe they don’t need that next thousand, and maybe that’s okay.”
Of course, the MBTA is not alone. Transit agencies across the country are struggling with their budgets after the pandemic rewired transportation patterns, eating away at fare revenue on which operators long relied, while the costs of running large systems continue to increase.
Lawmakers might be inclined to throw more one-time aid at the T, especially from the surtax, but they don’t seem particularly interested in debating a permanent funding overhaul, especially in an election year.
So for now, the never-ending dance will continue.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Transportation_MBTA_Commuter-Rail-edited.png?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-22 16:38:42.959133

“This is a great bill … I’m very much in favor,” said Sen. Craig Hart, R-Mingo, a public school teacher. 
The Senate Education Committee approved the legislation, sending it to the full Senate for consideration. 
The bill was modeled after a 2025 Senate measure that required all public primary and secondary schools, as well as institutions of higher education, to display the United States motto — In God we Trust — in a main building of the school that is accessible to the public.

Carvajal-Munoz earned a master’s degree from the University of Maine, and colleagues said he was in the country on a work visa.

This story was originally published by The Maine Monitor, a nonprofit and nonpartisan news organization. To get regular coverage from the Monitor, sign up for a free Monitor newsletter here.

	Agents left the car he was in, a grey Hyundai Tucson, running — with a smashed window — at the scene on Pearl Street in downtown Portland after taking Carvajal-Munoz just after 9 a.m., according to video from bystanders and an interview with a nearby parking attendant. A passerby then drove the vehicle into the parking lot, the attendant said.
The detention happened as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is conducting what it is calling “Operation Catch of the Day,” an immigration enforcement effort across Maine, “targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have terrorized communities,” according to an ICE press release.
But Carvajal-Munoz has no criminal record, according to TLOxp, a background check system from TransUnion.
He is at least the third person detained in Maine whom news outlets have found does not have a criminal record. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment and has not publicized a complete list of people it has detained. The agency said on Tuesday it had arrested 50 people in Maine, but the “Worst of the Worst” list it published contained only 13 names as of 12 p.m. on Thursday.
“In America, we don’t believe in secret arrests or secret police,” said Gov. Janet Mills during a Thursday press conference on ICE enforcement in Maine.
Agents pulled Carvajal-Munoz over by the Top of the Old Port parking lot between Cumberland and Congress streets, according to Greg Seligman, the parking lot attendant working at the time. Seligman said he didn’t see the interaction but saw the aftermath: Agents had smashed a car window and left the car running, he said.
Seligman said someone who witnessed the incident asked him if they could move the car into the parking lot. The car was still there around 10 a.m., and there was still glass on the road from where Carvajal-Munoz had been pulled over.
Seligman said Portland police responded to 911 calls after the detention but told him there was nothing local police could do as it was a federal operation. The Portland Police Department confirmed it received a report of a disturbance at 8:48 a.m. and that officers responded to check out the area.
Amanda Barnett, Carvajal-Munoz’s coworker at GEI Consultants in Portland, said Carvajal-Munoz is in Maine legally on a work visa. He has worked at the company for two-and-a-half years, according to another colleague, Ali Brady, who said they started on the same day in June 2023.
“I’m really scared for him,” Barnett said.
GEI Consultants is an engineering and environmental consulting firm with 62 locations across the U.S. and Canada, according to its website. Reached by phone, a company representative confirmed Carvajal-Munoz worked there but declined to comment on the detention while the company was gathering information.
An observer posted a video online of agents in police vests leading Carvajal-Munoz with his hands behind his back to a dark-colored car with flashing lights above the windshield. A second video showed the agents’ car driving away, leaving the car Carvajal-Munoz had been driving in the street.

Barnett said she heard from Carvajal-Munoz’s girlfriend that she received an emergency alert from Carvajal-Munoz’s phone. The girlfriend asked Barnett if he had made it to work. When Barnett and Brady learned he hadn’t, and saw the videos of him online, they both went to Pearl Street.
Carvajal-Munoz received a master’s degree in civil engineering from the University of Maine in Orono in May 2023, the school confirmed Thursday.
Aaron Gallant, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at UMaine, said Carvajal-Munoz was one of the hardest-working students he has had.
“I know that the entire department and faculty look very highly on Juan Sebastian,” Gallant told The Maine Monitor. “I’m shocked to hear this. I know his employers have been extremely happy with his performance as they’ve communicated to me regularly.”
Carvajal-Munoz has three years of experience in geotechnical engineering, geotechnical instrumentation, and construction observation, according to his LinkedIn profile.
“I have overseen and conducted geotechnical investigations for communities, cities, and agencies using a wide range of drilling, sampling, and in-situ testing methods,” he wrote on the platform. “My technical expertise includes shallow and deep foundation analysis, soil and rock slope stability analysis, and instrumented pile load testing.”

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-22 21:19:55+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi bills would put repeat domestic abusers on a public registry,Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/22/bills-put-repeat-domestic-abusers-on-public-registry/,A handful of bills pending in the Mississippi Legislature propose creating a public online system displaying information about people convicted of two or more domestic violence offenses.,"Kimberly Bartlett endured a year of beatings and strangulation at the hands of two former partners who are now incarcerated for crimes stemming from the abuse. She didn’t know it at the time, but both had a history of domestic violence.
When the Ellisville resident learned about an effort in Tennessee to create a public registry for repeat abusers, she wanted to see her state take action. 
As a mother and survivor, she said she believes a repeat domestic violence offender registry would be a game changer and something that could have alerted her about her partners’ pasts. She reached out to a local lawmaker and the Mississippi Coalition Against Domestic Violence to see if the state could create its own. 
“This has got to happen for our sake,” Bartlett said about the need for the registry for survivors, parents and the public.  
A handful of bills pending in the Mississippi Legislature propose creating a public online system displaying information about people convicted of two or more domestic violence offenses, including misdemeanors and felonies. Each entry would include a picture, name, county of conviction and charges. The Department of Public Safety would maintain the information. 
A repeat domestic violence offender would need to be convicted at least once in Mississippi, but any prior conviction can be from in or out of the state. Legislation would also require those who meet the criteria to be added to the register. 
The registry would list repeat offenders for crimes committed after the act becomes law, but any prior convictions used to establish their eligibility can be earlier. 
Rep. Charles Blackwell, a Republican from Ellisville, and Sen. Kamesha Mumford, a Clinton Democrat, each proposed registry bills supported by the coalition.
House Bill 1312 is called the “Purple Angels Law,” and Mumford’s Senate bill is expected to have a similar name. As of Thursday, the Senate bill was not available on the Legislature website. 
The bills are named for domestic violence victims, including those who have died, said Luis Montgomery, policy and justice strategist for the statewide domestic violence coalition, which is supporting efforts to create a registry and other domestic violence legislation. 
Additionally, Republican Rep. Lance Varner of Florence and Sen. Angela Burks Hill, a Republican from Picayune, filed HB 1371 and SB 2113 to create a repeat domestic offenders registry. Both bills include similar language as the Tennessee law. 
Tennessee’s registry, “Savanna’s Law,” was named for Savanna Puckett, a 22-year-old sheriff’s deputy, who was killed by her ex-boyfriend on Jan. 23, 2022. About a year later, James Jackson Conn pleaded guilty to first-degree, premeditated murder and is serving a life sentence. Investigators found he had a history of domestic violence and stalking other women. 
As in Tennessee, the registry would remove a person’s information after a certain period of time after a conviction. For one conviction, they would be listed for five years. It would be seven years for two prior convictions, a decade for three priors and 20 years for four prior convictions. 
Blackwell and Mumford’s bills propose a lifetime listing on the registry for anyone convicted of felony domestic violence, Montgomery said. Domestic felonies can include aggravated domestic violence and more than three misdemeanor domestic violence assaults.  
The proposed bills do not specify what charges would qualify someone for the registry. Montgomery said the language is open ended to account for other types of charges a person could face for a domestic offense, including stalking or sexual assault.  
The Mississippi bills would also establish a registry fee paid for by the person convicted of multiple domestic violence offenses. A portion of that money would go to support administrative costs, and the rest would be deposited into the state’s Domestic Violence Fund to provide grants for prevention, intervention and victim support services. 
Montgomery hopes establishing a repeat domestic offender registry can build on the momentum from the previous session when lawmakers created the state’s domestic violence fatality review committee. He serves as vice chairman of the group which is in the process of developing processes and policies to start reviewing domestic violence homicides and other deaths. 
Bartlett said she’s seen how women are scared to talk about domestic violence, which can lead to their voices being silenced and abuse being pushed under the rug. She hopes a registry can help spread awareness about the issue and empower people who use it. 
“You want to be able to check and verify and check in black and white, that this person is who they say they are, that they are safe,” Bartlett said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/22150451/MT-Domestic-Violence-Registry-FeatImage-01.jpg,,,2026-01-22 16:38:42.959133

Uthmeier [[...]","Rep. RaShon Young, D-Orlando, speaking in the Capitol on Jan. 22, 2026. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Three days after Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier observed Martin Luther King Jr. Dayby declaring in an advisory legal opinion that more than 80 state laws aimed at protecting minority employees and businesses are no longer valid, Black Democratic lawmakers protested during a press conference in the rotunda of the state Capitol on Thursday.
Uthmeier declared that those laws violate the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. “Florida laws requiring race-based state action are presumptively unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment,” he said in a social media post announcing the opinion.
In addition, he disparaged what he described as race-based quotas in Florida hiring practices and stipulations for minority representation on different boards, councils, and other panels.
“For many of us, this doesn’t feel like a neutral, legal interpretation, and more like an attack that history matters. That policy can be a tool to correct past and ongoing harm,” said Sen. Darryl Rouson, D-St. Petersburg.
AG advisory opinions don’t carry the force of law, unless ratified by a court, but can guide government policy.
The lawmakers want their Republican colleagues in the Legislature who filed bills to codify what Uthmeier is calling for to withdraw them. Among those bills are SB 1662, filed by Stan McClain, R-Ocala, and its close House companion, HB 1189, by Rep. Judson Sapp, R-Green Cove Springs.
McClain’s bill would prohibit executive government agencies from using racial or gender preferences or quotas when making certain decisions. Sapp’s measure would remove provisions requiring the governor to consider appointees to certain commissions reflecting Florida’s racial, ethnic, and gender diversity, and prohibit executive agencies from considering racial or gender preferences or quotas when making hiring decisions. Neither has been heard yet in committee.
“Y’all, we cannot let these bills become law,” said Sen. LaVon Bracy, D-Ococee. “And we are counting on every member of this Legislature to ensure that they do not. Because we cannot claim to honor Dr. King on Monday and dismantle his legacy on Thursday.”
Among the agencies the lawmakers say could removed if Uthmeier’s opinion were adopted include the Office of Minority Health, the Office of Supplier Development, as well housing and community development programs and representation on state boards and commissions.
“Let’s make clear: Health disparities are documented realities, not mere political opinions,” said Rep. Marie Woodson, D-Hollywood. “The statistics tell a stark story. Blacks and Indians face significantly higher maternal mortality rates. Minority communities consistently experience worst health outcomes that are significant indicators. These are not just statistics. It’s a matter of life and death.”
To Sen. Mack Bernard, D-West Palm Beach, Uthmeier’s’ unilateral declaration is tantamount to disobeying the law that he is enforced to uphold. Bernard called upon Gov. Ron DeSantis to suspend him, as the governor did to Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren in 2022 after alleging Warren had said that he would refuse to prosecute violent offenders or enforce criminal penalties against doctors providing abortions or gender-affirming care.
“If the attorney general does not want to follow the laws that we have passed, I’m declaring that I think that the governor should remove him today,” said Bernard. “He is not a judge. He is just part of the executive branch, and the executive branch needs to do what they’re supposed to do. … [I]f he does not want to follow the laws? Then guess what? We need to remove him immediately.”
Rep. RaShon Young, D-Orlando, said the issue wasn’t the attorney general, but about “sounding the alarm” for everyone who will be affected if the programs are eliminated.
“For Black Floridians and brown Floridians, and women and immigrants and poor and working-class families and first-generation students, for small businesses owners and Black-owned business trying to survive and grow,” he said. “For children who depend on programs that give them access to college information opportunity.”
While the state is now threatening to remove decades-old programs intended to support minorities, some municipalities in Florida have already removed such programs in response to President Donald Trump’s executive order cracking down on diversity, equity, and inclusion announced at the beginning of his second term a year ago.
Rouson suggested that instead there should be an independent study by the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability (a research arm of the Legislature) to determine which state programs are still needed, particularly in areas like disparity and access to healthcare.
Uthmeier, 37, has never been elected to any political office. The former chief of staff to DeSantis, the governor appointed him to replace Ashley Moody as AG a year ago. Although there was speculation he might receive a challenge in the Republican primary later this summer, those possibilities appeared to expire after Trump endorsed him in his election bid last year.
José Javier Rodriguez, Uthmeier’s likely Democratic opponent this fall, blasted the opinion earlier in the week.

“It is troubling that our Florida Attorney General has chosen, of all days, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day to announce an effort to undermine civil rights,” he said in a written statement. “Equal protection has never meant ignoring discrimination, it means confronting it. This kind of politicization of the Attorney General’s office is exactly what Floridians are tired of.”
The same day that Uthmeier issued his advisory opinion, Texas AG Ken Paxton issued an advisory opinion asserting that “decades’ worth of DEI frameworks” embedded in Texas law are unconstitutional.
The attorney general’s office did not immediately respond for a request for comment.
Along with the legislation listed above, additional bills filed in the Florida Legislature this session aim to cut DEI programs or funding. They include:


HB 1001 (filed by Rep. Dean Black, R-Jacksonville): Would prohibit counties and municipalities from funding or promoting official actions related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
SB 1090 (filed by Sen. Erin Grall, R-Vero Beach): Would prohibit public schools, school districts, and charter schools from spending state or federal funds to promote or maintain diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.

Yvette Benarroch, R-Marco Island): Would prohibit local governments from using public funds for diversity, equity, and inclusion purposes, and prohibit them from contracting with private vendors for training or education on diversity, equity, and inclusion.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/0-1-4-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-22 16:38:42.959133

Michigan House Republicans on Wednesday criticized the state Department of Health and Human Services over its plan to distribute just over $173 million in federal rural health care funding, arguing that eligibility rules improperly allow the state’s most populous counties to compete with sparsely populated ones.
The House Appropriations Committee heard testimony on a proposal for allocating money from the federal Rural Health Transformation program, a $50 billion program created by Congress in response to concerns by rural health care providers about the Medicaid cuts included in 2025’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
However, Michigan House GOP lawmakers objected to the department’s definition of “partially rural,” which would allow counties such as Wayne and Oakland to qualify for grants alongside counties in Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula.
“When Lansing talks about being ‘inclusive,’ too often it means Northern communities get left behind,” Rep. Cam Cavitt (R-Cheboygan) said in a press release. “For DHHS to suggest that Wayne County deserves rural funding is an insult to everyone who lives north of Clare.”
State health department officials said they will weigh multiple factors when awarding grants, including population and geographic isolation, to ensure funding reaches areas with the greatest need.
“I fully recognize that there are major differences between what’s available in a fully rural county or a partially rural county,” Beth Nagel, senior deputy director at MDHHS, told the committee. “And so we do plan to prioritize, based on not only population, but some of those other factors as well, completely understanding that there are differences, and we do want this funding to reach who it needs to impact, but we also want it to be as inclusive as possible. So it’s kind of walking that fine line.”
Beth Nagel, senior deputy director at MDHHS, testifying before the House Appropriations Committee. Jan. 21, 2025. | Screenshot
Cavitt said that under the department’s criteria, any county deemed rural or partially rural qualifies for funding, allowing entities within those counties to apply as long as proposals claim to support rural health care. 
Rep. John Roth (R-Interlochen) questioned how small northern counties could compete under that structure.
“Are we really saying that the 22,000 people of Leelanau County must compete with Detroit for rural healthcare funding?” Roth asked in a press release. “Leelanau and Grand Traverse County are lumped into the same ‘partial rural’ category as Wayne, Oakland, and 13 others. I’ve driven through Northern Michigan, and I’ve driven through Detroit – there is simply no comparison.”
Roth further noted that residents in Wayne and Oakland counties have relatively immediate access to top-tier hospitals, while those living in smaller, northern counties often must drive more than an hour to receive basic care. He said the proposal reflected a “fundamental misunderstanding of rural Michigan.”
In response to the criticism, Lynn Sutfin, spokesperson for the state health department, told Michigan Advance in an email that the rural classifications in the state’s proposal mirror the definitions of the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy within the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration.
“This broad definition of the term rural is meant to provide as many opportunities as possible for Michigan’s rural residents to benefit from the funds whether they reside in a county that is fully rural or partially rural,” Sutfin said, adding that the department anticipated prioritizing counties with a high prevalence of chronic disease, limited access to health care facilities, high Medicaid dependence and significant rates of child poverty or aging populations.
The state Department of Health and Human Services serves as a pass-through agency for the federal grants, which must be awarded and distributed by December.

Abigail Spanberger addresses the media ahead of a winter storm on Jan. 22, 2026. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)A major winter storm is set to sweep across Virginia this weekend bringing accumulations of snow, sleet, and freezing rain. Gov. Abigail Spanberger, leading the state during her first major weather event in office, declared a state of emergency Thursday and said the ice and potential power outages will pose a serious threat.
“We are expecting large amounts of snowfall, freezing rain, and sleet,” Spanberger said at the Virginia Emergency Operations Center in Richmond. “We also expect Virginia will experience dangerously low temperatures, power outages, and unpredictable road conditions.”
The governor’s emergency declaration will allow the National Guard to be mobilized and other resources to be staged. The weather will stay below freezing for several days following the storm and nighttime temperatures will reach single digits.
The Virginia Department of Transportation posted on X Thursday that the agency had begun pre-treating roads statewide.
“If you encounter our slow-moving trucks on the road, be patient and keep your distance. Give them room to work safely as we all prepare for weekend winter weather,” VDOT posted. 
Still, after the storm, it could be some time before roads are able to be cleared. 
“It is possible that some localities or some subdivisions will not see a snow plow for anywhere up to 24-48 hours after the snow is concluded,” Spanberger said.
The initial storm models earlier in the week were projected to have major snow totals, nearly two feet in some regions, which has since shifted north. But the ice and rain behind the snow bands particularly concern officials, because weather patterns including ice are harder to predict than ones with snow, and ice is more damaging to trees and power infrastructure. 
While the storm promises treacherous conditions, it is not unprecedented. Michael Dutter with the National Weather Service’s Wakefield office said that these types of widespread winter storms that impact much of the country usually happen roughly once a decade. 
Dutter said recent technology advancement helped to predict this major storm was coming much sooner than they would have been able to forecast just ten years ago.
“What we have with all the computing power you know, we have probabilistic information that … we can sort of give probabilities of what area might have the best potential for a piece of snowfall,” Dutter said.
Dutter urged the public to prepare for the ice just as much, if not more, as they do for the snow.
In Richmond and surrounding areas, some members of the community are feeling nervous about whether the water systems will be able to withstand the storm, after the last major winter storm in 2025 left the city and surrounding counties without water for nearly a week. 
The storm triggered a power switch failure at the city’s water treatment plant that prevented backup generators from kicking in, and the problem was amplified by staff miscommunications. 
Richmond Mayor Danny Avula said in a press conference outside City Hall Thursday new preparations have been made at the water treatment plant ahead of this weekend’s storm in addition to the year-long efforts to improve the facility. 
Richmond Department of Utilities Director Scott Morris added that the facility’s staffing and preparations are very different from what was in place a year ago.
“We have both power feeds available to the plant. The backup generators are available to those plants, we’re coordinated,” Morris said.
Spanberger said the Richmond water crisis was part of table top training exercises she has undertaken since she was elected. Her training helped her prepare for potential threats to the commonwealth during weather events her administration will need to respond to, she said.
Virginians are asked to limit travel and stay off the roads this weekend. The Virginia Department of Emergency Management is offering a list of safety and prep tips on its website.

However, the newly appointed principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ralph Abraham, said he was unbothered by the prospect at a briefing for […]","A nurse readies a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in May 2025 at Sanford Children’s Hospital in Sioux Falls. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)After a year of ongoing measles outbreaks that have sickened more than 2,400 people, the United States is poised to lose its status as a measles-free country. However, the newly appointed principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ralph Abraham, said he was unbothered by the prospect at a briefing for journalists this week.
“It’s just the cost of doing business with our borders being somewhat porous for global and international travel,” Abraham said. “We have these communities that choose to be unvaccinated. That’s their personal freedom.”
Infections from other countries, however, accounted for only about 10% of measles cases detected since Jan. 20, 2025, the official start of the deadly measles outbreak in West Texas, which spread to other states and Mexico. The rest were acquired domestically. This marks a change since the U.S. eliminated measles in 2000. Measles occasionally popped up in the U.S. from people infected abroad, but the cases rarely sparked outbreaks, because of extremely high rates of vaccination. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine strongly prevent infection and halt the virus’s spread.
To maintain its measles elimination status, the U.S. must prove that the virus has not circulated continuously in the nation for a year, between Jan. 20, 2025, and Jan. 20, 2026. To answer the question, scientists are examining whether the major outbreaks in South Carolina, Utah, Arizona, and Texas were linked.
Health officials confirmed that the main measles virus strain in each of these outbreaks is D8-9171. But because this strain also occurs in Canada and Mexico, CDC scientists are now analyzing the entire genomes of measles viruses — about 16,000 genetic letters long — to see whether those in the United States are more closely related to one another than to those in other countries.
The CDC expects to complete its studies within a couple of months and make the data public. Then the Pan American Health Organization, which oversees the Americas in partnership with the World Health Organization, will decide whether the U.S. will lose its measles elimination status. And that would mean that costly, potentially deadly, and preventable measles outbreaks could become common again.
“When you hear somebody like Abraham say ‘the cost of doing business,’ how can you be more callous,” said pediatrician and vaccine specialist Paul Offit, in an online discussion hosted by the health blog Inside Medicine on Jan. 20. “Three people died of measles last year in this country,” Offit added. “We eliminated this virus in the year 2000 — eliminated it. Eliminated circulation of the most contagious human infection. That was something to be proud of.”
Abraham said vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles but that parents must have the freedom to decide whether to vaccinate their children. Several states have loosened school vaccine requirements since 2020, and vaccination rates have dropped. A record rate of kindergartners, representing about 138,000 children, obtained vaccine exemptions for the 2024-25 school year.
Information on vaccines has been muddied by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who previously founded an anti-vaccine organization. He has undermined vaccines throughout his tenure. On national television, he has repeated scientifically debunked rumors that vaccines may cause autism, brain swelling, and death.
Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University, disparaged the Trump administration’s focus on finding genetic technicalities that may spare the country’s measles-free status. “This is the wrong thing to pay attention to. Our attention has to be on stopping the outbreaks,” she said.
“If we keep our status, it should be because we have stopped the spread of measles,” she said. “It’s like they’re trying to be graded on a curve.”
The Trump administration impeded the CDC’s ability to assist West Texas during the first critical weeks of its outbreak and slowed the release of federal emergency funds, according to KFF Health News investigations. However, the agency stepped up its activity last year, providing local health departments with measles vaccines, communication materials, and testing. Abraham said HHS would give South Carolina $1.5 million to respond to its outbreak, which began nearly four months ago and had reached 646 cases as of Jan. 20.
If the CDC’s genomic analyses show that last year’s outbreaks resulted from separate introductions from abroad, political appointees will probably credit Kennedy for saving the country’s status, said Demetre Daskalakis, a former director of the CDC’s national immunization center, who resigned in protest of Kennedy’s actions in August.
And if studies suggest the outbreaks are linked, Daskalakis predicted, the administration will cast doubt on the findings and downplay the reversal of the country’s status: “They’ll say, who cares.”
Indeed, at the briefing, Abraham told a reporter from Stat that a reversal in the nation’s status would not be significant: “Losing elimination status does not mean that the measles would be widespread.”
Data shows otherwise. Case counts last year were the highest since 1991, before the government enacted vaccine policies to ensure that all children could be protected with measles immunization.

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star) The town of Camden and Mid-Coast Solid Waste Corporation are suing manufacturers of toxic firefighting foam for creating and selling products with “forever chemicals” that have been detected in the town’s wastewater. 
The New Hampshire-based SL Environmental Law Group filed the lawsuit against 3M Company, DuPont and other manufacturers of aqueous film-forming foam on behalf of the town and solid waste corporation, according to a news release Thursday. 
“In Camden, we believe all water should be free of harmful forever chemicals,” said David St. Laurent, Camden Public Works director. “We are proud to join the fight to hold the PFAS manufacturers accountable for the pollution they caused.”
State-mandated sampling at the city-operated wastewater treatment plant has detected per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, according to the law firm. 
PFAS is a known carcinogen linked to an array of health issues. In addition to responding to high levels of PFAS in agricultural land from the historic spreading of sewage sludge, Maine was the first state to pass a rule requiring manufacturers to report intentionally added PFAS in products.
Gov. Janet Mills recently allowed a new law to establish a voluntary, statewide takeback program for firefighting foam laden with forever chemicals. This legislation was part of a package of three bills brought forth by Rep. Dan Ankeles (D-Brunswick) after 1,500 gallons of foam concentrate was discharged in a Brunswick airplane hangar in August 2024.
In addition to Camden and Mid-Coast Solid Waste, SL Environmental is handling similar cases for more than 300 agencies across the country affected by PFAS.

A ballot measure the Legislature might refer to voters later this year could boost funding for public education. (Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado public schools could get a funding boost under a ballot measure lawmakers will consider referring this year.
The measure would raise the cap on how much revenue the state can keep and spend under the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights. The increase would be tied to how much the state spends on education through its general fund, which is now about $4.5 billion. The measure is backed by the Colorado Education Association, a teachers union.
“For more than 30 years, an outdated and arbitrary revenue cap has kept our state funding tied up so tightly that we can’t invest in public education and keep up with student needs,” CEA President Kevin Vick said during a press conference Thursday on the steps of the Colorado Capitol. “Even when Colorado’s economy is strong, this cap blocks the state from using money it already collects for K-12 education.”

The state is required to refund money it collects over the TABOR cap to taxpayers through a variety of mechanisms. In recent years, it has sent direct checks to people and issued various tax credits, but under the proposed measure that money would go to education instead of back to taxpayers.
Two studies found that Colorado lags in school funding by between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. Even if the cap is raised for education costs, that doesn’t mean the funding gap will actually close, because the state does not collect money over the cap — known as a TABOR surplus — every year. A forecast from the non-partisan Legislative Council Staff in December predicted a $297 million surplus in the 2025 fiscal year, but a $465 million deficit below the cap in the 2026 fiscal year.
“This will give us $90 million to $100 million. That is far from ultimate sufficiency, but we need to provide some relief now,” Vick said.
But education advocates still see the ballot measure as a strategy to address low teacher pay, growing classroom sizes and shrinking support in schools, particularly in rural parts of the state.
“Schools keep losing teachers, paraprofessionals and support staff, because wages don’t come close to a livable income,” said Sam Islaub, a library teacher and paraprofessional in Summit County. “Turnover increases, stability disappears and students lose the trusted adults who support them every day.”
The state’s teacher turnover rate is about 17%, while the rate in Summit County is nearly 26%, according to data from the Colorado Department of Education. The average teacher salary is about $73,000.
“We’re standing here today because we believe that our work matters and that our students matter. Voters should have the chance to show that they agree,” she said.
The measure would also have an annual audit provision, Vick said.
The bill to refer the measure will be sponsored by Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat, and Rep. Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat and the assistant majority leader in the House. Vick said the legislation is expected to be introduced in early February.
The ballot measure would come on the heels of other moves to increase education funding. A new funding formula passed by the Legislature last year will direct an additional $500 million to schools over seven years. The Legislature also got rid of the so-called budget stabilization factor in 2024, a mechanism that let the state fund schools below a constitutional level to make the budget work.
Legislation to refer the measure to voters will need a simple majority in both the state House and Senate to land on this year’s ballot. Democrats have large majorities in both chambers.
The last time the Legislature referred a measure to raise the TABOR cap was in 2023 with Proposition HH, which was aimed at reducing the impact of property taxes. It failed by 19 percentage points.

The move began at the N.C. Aquarium at Fort Fisher, where staff secured a female weighing 282 pounds and a male weighing 165 pounds into a special cargo net, the North Carolina Dept. of Natural and Cultural Resources shared on Wednesday. 
They then loaded the sharks using a telehandler — a machine that’s like a hybrid of a forklift and a crane — onto a vehicle with a mobile aquarium.

The sharks first stopped at the N.C. Aquarium at Pine Knoll Shores. Here, staff introduced the male shark to his new home at the Living Shipwreck habitat.
Next, the team traveled farther north, moving the female shark to the N.C. Aquarium on Roanoke Island’s Graveyard of the Atlantic exhibit. 
“The transport of these two special sharks was amazing to watch,” N.C. Aquarium at Fort Fisher director Joanna Zazzali said. “We are grateful for the excellent preparation and planning from everyone on the team to execute the transport as flawlessly as possible and especially appreciate the assist from our friends at the Georgia Aquarium.”
The Fort Fisher location had housed the two sharks for almost a decade, where they resided in the 235,000-gallon Cape Fear Shoals habitat. The sharks’ new homes are larger and will provide more space for the animals as they continue growing — Living Shipwreck has 306,000 gallons, and Graveyard of the Atlantic has 285,000.
This move comes ahead of the N.C. Aquarium at Fort Fisher’s upcoming closure due to major renovations. All areas of the aquarium will be closed to the public for the duration of the project, which is estimated to take more than two years. 
A hard closing date for the aquarium has yet to be announced.

FRANKFORT — Under a bill that passed the House Health Services Committee Thursday, Kentucky’s Cabinet for Health and Family Services would hire a statewide coordinator who could help more hospitals offer comprehensive rape kit care. 
House Bill 134 comes in response to a report released in December by the Legislative Research Commission, which shows Kentucky has a shortage of sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs), who have advanced training in collecting rape kits and offering trauma-informed care to sexual assault survivors. 


HB 134 progress 



That report also shows 100 of Kentucky’s 120 counties do not have a SANE-ready hospital. Hospitals must have a sexual assault nurse examiner on call 24/7 to qualify for SANE-ready certification, though state law requires emergency departments to be able to examine, collect and report evidence of sexual assault and treat victims. 
Of those 100 counties without SANE-ready hospitals, 44 don’t border a county with a SANE-ready hospital, according to the report. 
Bill sponsor Rep. Rebecca Raymer, R-Morgantown, previously told the Lantern she wants to add an appropriation request to make sure the position has adequate state funding, though that hasn’t yet been added to the bill. 
Under HB 134 in its current form, the cabinet would also develop a state registry of nurses certified to examine patients who have been sexually assaulted and have it operational by Dec. 1. Though there has been an increase in nurses getting a credential in recent years, many do not use the credential in their full time role. 
Most Kentucky counties have no nurse trained to examine, treat sexual assault victims

During Thursday’s committee hearing, Raymer said the bill is needed because Kentucky has “staggering statistics” around sexual assault: According to the Kentucky Association of Sexual Assault Programs, around 39% of women in Kentucky will experience sexual violence at some point in their lives. Around 23% will experience a rape. And, about 18% of men will experience sexual violence in their lifetime, according to KASAP’s data, which only represents what is reported. 
Melissa Gilpin, a sexual assault nurse examiner of more than 20 years who works at Med Center Health in Bowling Green, told the committee that the coordinator role is needed. 
“I have taken care of hundreds of survivors,” Gilpin said, “and this is more important than you can imagine.”

A hyper-realistic video shows John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr. and Abraham Lincoln playing video games. Another, of Michael Jackson dancing in a fast-food restaurant, has over 25.3 million views on TikTok.
But in Louisiana, two middle-school boys created artificial-intelligence generated nude images of their female classmates. It’s becoming nearly impossible to tell a real video from one generated by AI, and the technology can be used for nefarious purposes far beyond entertainment.
A bill proposed in the Mississippi Legislature would make it illegal to create such deepfakes in the Magnolia state. 
Sen. Bradford Blackmon, a Democrat from Canton, has reintroduced a bill to give Mississippians the right to their image, name and voice. The Mississippians’ Right to Name, Likeness and Voice Act would enact penalties for using a person’s image in AI-generated content without their consent.
“This is not theoretical. These are real kids, real classrooms facing real consequences from fake content,” said Blackmon.

Last year, a former Mississippi teacher pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography after he was accused of creating explicit videos of his students using AI.
In 2024, Mississippi passed two laws that regulate AI use. One addressed using deepfakes in political campaigns and the other other classifies AI images of children as child exploitation.
The rapid improvement of AI and growing concerns around deepfakes have led to piecemeal legislation across the country. But the federal government wants to dictate AI regulation, over fear state regulations would hinder the technology’s development. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last year that pushes for a consolidated national approach to AI regulation and allows the U.S. attorney general to challenge state AI laws. 
In the meantime, Blackmon said he would “rather be proactive than reactive” when it comes to regulating AI in Mississippi.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Legislature passed two bills this week prohibiting civil courts from issuing nondisclosure agreements against survivors of sexual assault.
SB 30, sponsored by Sen. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, and HB 93, sponsored by Rep. David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, intend to protect survivors and further the healing process following sexual assault and abuse.
“We need to allow victims of this terrible act to heal. The only way they can heal is to be able to disclose what’s happened to them, talk about it, and move on with the healing process,” Woods said in an interview.
 
 If you or someone you know is in a crisis, call, text or chat the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988. For a list of Crisis Centers in Alabama, visit the Alabama Department of Mental Health’s website. For help with grief and loss, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention offers advice and resources.


The Senate passed its bill 29-0 on Wednesday. The House passed its bill 98-0 on Thursday. Both bills move to their next chambers.
The bill is named Trey’s Law, after the late Trey Carlock. Carlock was sexually abused at a Christian sports camp, Kanakuk, in Missouri by its director Pete Newman, who is serving three life sentences in Missouri prison. Carlock died by suicide in 2019 at 28 years old, after a civil case against the ministry involving Carlock’s and other victims’ abuse resurfaced his trauma, according to Trey’s Law website.
“Some of Trey’s cousins actually reside in Walker County, and I have some affiliations with them. They reached out to me to make me aware of what his sister Elizabeth is doing nationwide to bring attention to Trey’s law,” Woods said. 
According to the Trey’s Law website, victims of sexual assault often wait to speak up about their abuse due to fear and shame. Due to waiting, there is often nothing to be done within the statute of limitations, which often leads to NDAs finalizing their silence. 
A settlement from Kanakuk in Carlock’s civil suit included an NDA, according to the website, effectively silencing Carlock and “covering up what Kanakuk knew about Newman and when.”
“To quote Trey’s sister Elizabeth, ‘The use of NDAs in settlement agreements is essentially lawful hush money. It’s institutional abuse on top of sexual abuse. NDAs are a legal mechanism that were created to protect trade secrets, not trauma secrets,’” Woods said during debate on the Senate floor Wednesday.
Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, voted for the bill but cautioned that it may have unintended consequences for churches and nonprofit organizations.
“That non-disclosure statement is a lifeline very often, for the institution to continue efforts in trying to do good,” Albritton said. “But they paid the price, and they paid the money. The non-disclosure allowed them to continue in operation in some ways.”
Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, D-Mobile, said that protecting churches and nonprofits is not what matters.
“I think we need to be more concerned about our children than some entity or institution,” Figures said. “More times than not, it’s been proven that these entities and institutions knew what was going on and didn’t do anything about it.”
The bill was Woods’ first since being elected to the Senate in a special election last summer. Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, congratulated him.
“I just wanted to tell you, for that particular bill, that was kind of a tough bill to go through. I know there’s a lot of national attention to it, and so thank you for being here,” Gudger said.
Rep. Juandalynn Givan, D-Birmingham, said Thursday while she supported the bill, she had some concerns with the language in the bill for NDAs.
“I guess for me, the alarm comes when you called it specifically an NDA. I think that you should have modified if it’s just NDAs, fine, but then when you get into the subject matter of other types of agreements, then it makes it a little difficult,” Givan said.
Woods said in an interview he hopes Alabama can be one of the first states to pass the law. Similar legislation has passed in Texas, Missouri, Tennessee and California.
“Alabama needs to be a place that’s leading in this, and I believe today was a step in the right direction,” Woods said.

Jason Bean of Holcomb, pictured listening from his Senate desk Feb. 12, 2024, has sponsored a bill seeking state oversight of the Missouri State High School Activities Association for three consecutive years. This legislative session, his proposal is gaining traction early on in session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Changes to the organization that oversees high school athletics in Missouri are a top priority of state lawmakers this year, following allegations of discrimination under investigation by Attorney General Catherine Hanaway.
State Sen. Jason Bean, a Republican from Holcomb, and state Rep. Bennie Cook, a Houston Republican, have filed bills the past two years seeking to give the state authority when athletes and coaches appeal decisions made by Missouri High School Activities Association . Neither bill got any traction. 
This year, their proposals are some of the first to get hearings in House and Senate committees and were namechecked by Gov. Mike Kehoe in his annual State of the State address.
“This reform is about good governance, consistent standards and ensuring that decisions impacting Missouri students and funded by Missouri taxpayers are made openly, fairly and responsibly,” Kehoe said. “Unelected bureaucrats cannot act like kings.”
The House Government Efficiency Committee and Senate Education Committee examined MSHSAA’s appeals process during public hearings Thursday morning. Bean and Cook both focused on incidents in which schools have appealed the association’s rulings, such as when a scoring mistake changed the outcome of a basketball quarterfinal game in 2023.
“I don’t see the role of this new oversight board as one to absorb the day-to-day governance of MSHSAA,” Bean told the Senate committee. “Rather, parents, students, coaches, school districts, etc., need an avenue to appeal decisions made by MSHSAA to an independent oversight board.”
Their bills set the framework for a board appointed by the governor that could handle appeals. Currently, MSHSAA has a two-pronged appeals process that allows athletes and their parents to challenge rules and decisions.
But a process in which MSHSAA oversees appeals of its decisions doesn’t satisfy everyone.
Nick Purler, who runs a wrestling academy in Moscow Mills, said he’s watched his wrestlers face MSHSAA decisions “who should have been treated more fairly.”
“MSHSAA seems to be the judge, jury and executioner, and I don’t think that’s fair,” he said.
MSHSAA operates as a member organization and is not run by the state, though most of the state’s public schools and many private schools have signed on as members.
Democrats questioned the idea of regulating a private, nonprofit organization.
“If we start here on nonprofits and say that there could be an appointed board by the governor, where are we to stop?” said state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat. “Think about the amount of nonprofits that exist across the state. Now it is the state’s job to get involved in all of these other nonprofits?”
Senate Education Committee Chairman Rick Brattin, a Republican from Harrisonville, argued that MSHSAA has a monopoly over high school athletics in the state. Although it’s a voluntary organization, there is not another option for public schools who want to participate in interscholastic competition.
MSHSAA Executive Director Jennifer Rukstad told the committee that the association operates as a democracy, with member schools voting on its bylaws.
“The schools have said, ‘We’ve set up our rules and now we need somebody to help us to follow them,’” she said. “So they have hired a staff, and they have tasked us to be the experts on the rules they have written, and they have asked us to help them enforce those rules.”
Investigation
MSHSAA’s board of directors, which has eight members and two at-large members, is elected by schools. A policy created in 2004 establishing the two at-large positions has caught the attention of lawmakers, driving attention to the legislation.
The policy requires the at-large positions to be filled by “candidates representing the under-represented gender of the current board or an under-represented ethnicity.”
Merlyn Johnson, superintendent of the Cassville School District, reported this policy to the Missouri State Auditor’s Office last year after he was deemed ineligible to run for an at-large position.
Rukstad, in an email to Johnson in March, said the board “has a majority of males,” which disqualified him unless he identified with an underrepresented “ethnicity or race group.”
In November, Hanaway announced she was investigating the incident, calling the policy an “overtly racist practice.” Rukstad was not embarrassed when her email to Johnson became public, she told committee members, because she believes the policy is not discriminatory.
The eight original seats on the board are open to any administrator, she said. It is just the two at-large positions with “additional qualifiers.”
State Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance, said the email fueled his support for the legislation.
“Seeing this email really has me ticked off,” he said. “Just adding up all the different flaws within MSHSAA, I think that is the reason why this is a sound bill.”
Neither committee took immediate action on the bills Thursday.

Jeff Klemp, R-Lansing, says a proposed constitutional amendment would lower property taxes by rolling back the appraised values to 2022 and capping annual increases at 3%. He is pictured here during a March 26, 2025, session of the Senate. (Photo by Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Senate committee endorsed a proposed constitutional amendment that would cap annual increases to appraised property values at 3%, and roll back the clock to 2022 assessments.
Republicans on the Senate tax committee said during debate Wednesday that the cap was just part of the solution for easing the property tax burden on homeowners.
“We all know that this constitutional amendment will not lower property tax, right? said  Sen. Stephen Owens, R-Hesston. “And I want to be clear, we put that out there, will not lower it. May slow the growth, but it will not lower it.”
Owens said he hopes the committee also will look at ways to limit mill levies that local governments can assess.
The committee is considering a variety of measures to address property taxes, including legislation that would provide a tax refund when a house sells for below the appraised value.
Senate Concurrent Resolution 1616 would require county appraisals in 2027 to be no more than 3% higher than the values as assessed in 2022, and it would limit year-to-year increases after that to 3%. If two-thirds of the full Senate and House were to approve the resolution, voters in the August primary would have the opportunity to rewrite the state constitution with the 3% cap.
Sen. Jeff Klemp, R-Lansing, noted that by going back to 2022 appraisals, the amendment would provide some immediate relief in lowering property tax bills.
During an earlier hearing on the proposed constitutional amendment, opponents complained that it would have the effect of shifting the burden of funding local government services to other taxes.
“I did spend several hours yesterday evening on the phone with several county commissioners across the state taking a look,” said Sen. Caryn Tyson, R-Parker, who chairs the tax committee. “They all understand that we have to move on property taxes. So, may not be an agreement on the movement, but they understand this is part of the puzzle.”
After advancing SCR 1616 on Wednesday, the committee heard testimony on Senate Bill 319, which would allow residential, commercial and industrial property owners to apply for a tax rebate if property sells for less than the appraised value.
Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, introduced the bill. He told the committee he was upset that the Johnson County appraiser compared his 24-year-old home to newly built homes and one directly on a golf course to determine its value. He blamed the unfair comparisons for a 6.5% increase in his appraisal last year.
“We’ve been, basically, in my personal experience, overpaying tax, what I believe to be overpaying tax, for quite some time on the property based on the assigned value, based on the comparables,” Thompson said.
He said he understands the job of appraisers is difficult but that he thinks the bill will force them “to get as close as they can.”

Green International Airport in March 2023. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Planning to fly out of Rhode Island T.F. Green without a Real ID next month? It’s going to cost you.
Starting Feb. 1, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will require travelers without compliant forms of identification to verify their identity through a biometric or biographic system before they are allowed to pass through a TSA checkpoint.
Travelers can do so ahead of time online through the TSA’s new ConfirmID program, which comes with a $45 charge. Passengers will need to have a printed or electronic copy of their receipt to show the TSA officer verifying identification at the airport checkpoint. It takes an average of 15 minutes to use the ConfirmID program, but it could take as long as  half an hour in some cases, TSA officials say.
A ConfirmID receipt is valid for 10 days following its purchase, according to the TSA.
Travelers without a valid ID or receipt may not be allowed through security and risk missing their flight, an agency spokesperson said in an email to Rhode Island Current.
“Those who do not want to pay the $45 fee for the modernized ID verification still have time to get their REAL ID-compliant driver’s license or another acceptable form of ID,” Daniel Burche, TSA federal security director for Rhode Island, said in a statement. “While most travelers provide acceptable identification, it is our responsibility to confirm that passengers are who they claim to be.”
As of May 2025, travelers 18 or older nationwide must present either a U.S. passport or a REAL ID card marked with a gold star in the top right corner to board domestic flights or enter federal buildings.
President George W. Bush signed a law mandating the IDs in 2005 in response to security concerns raised by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The original compliance deadline was in 2008, but has been delayed by the federal government several times. 
Since Real ID started last year, 97% of the passengers at T.F. Green have shown some form of identification that conforms with Real ID standards, according to the TSA.
Rhode Islanders can make appointments to get a real REAL ID through either the state’s Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or at local AAA branches if they are members. First time applicants will be required to provide one proof of identity document such as a birth certificate, proof of Social Security, and two proofs of Rhode Island residency such as a utility bill.
If your name has changed, you’ll need to provide official documentation, such as a government-issued marriage certificate, divorce decree, or adoption paperwork. Travelers applying for a REAL ID within their license renewal period, which is the 90 days before a license or ID expires, don’t have to pay any additional costs. Outside that renewal period, it will cost $27.50 to upgrade to a REAL ID.
As of Jan. 1, the state’s DMV issued 593,157 Real ID cards — representing nearly 69% of all active IDs, according to data provided to Rhode Island Current.



People traveling with a Real ID or another approved identification method can skip the $45 fee. Acceptable forms of ID include:

REAL ID 
U.S. passport
U.S. passport card
DHS trusted traveler cards (Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, FAST)
U.S. Department of Defense ID, including IDs issued to dependents
Permanent resident card
Border crossing card
An acceptable photo ID issued by a federally recognized Tribal Nation/Indian Tribe, including Enhanced Tribal Cards
HSPD-12 PIV card
Foreign government-issued passport
Canadian provincial driver’s license or Indian and Northern Affairs Canada card
Transportation Worker Identification Credential
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Employment Authorization Card
U.S. Merchant Mariner Credential
Veteran Health Identification Card

Mike Dunleavy's veto of Senate Bill 113 is displayed on the voting board in the House on Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Republicans in the Alaska Legislature voted down a new funding source for public school programs Thursday as they sustained Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of Senate Bill 113.
The vote on overriding the governor was 35-25, 10 votes short of the 45 needed for an override. All of the “no” votes came from Republicans in the House and Senate minority caucuses. Those voting no included some legislators, such as Sen. Rob Yundt, R-Wasilla, who had strongly supported the bill last year.
If SB 113 had been enacted, the bill would have shifted some corporate income tax payments from other states to Alaska. 
The result was expected to be between $25 million and $65 million per year in new revenue for the state treasury, and the bill called for much of that money to go to programs that help young children learn how to read and to career-technical education programs that teach Alaskans non-college trades. 
Dunleavy vetoed the bill last fall, saying he was unwilling to approve any tax measure that was not part of a comprehensive, long-term plan intended to balance state revenue and expenses.
Under the Alaska Constitution, the veto needed to be taken up during the first five days of the regular session if lawmakers wanted to override it.

(Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)Slim profit margins, high operating costs, low staff compensation, and limited government funding led to a 11% net loss in licensed child care programs in New Hampshire between 2017 and 2025, according to new research from the UNH Carsey School of Public Policy. 
A new primer, released Thursday, reports that the disparity between tuition prices parents can afford and the high costs of operating a child care program are challenges that cause programs to be “economically strained and financially complex.” 
Research shows that operating a program with separate classrooms for infants, toddlers, 3-year-olds, and 4-year-olds costs between $1.1 million and $1.8 million a year, depending on whether educators are being paid a living wage and if they have benefits. Providers try to offer benefits without increasing tuition prices, because if staff stay, program capacity can increase and revenue can improve. 
Tuition is the primary revenue source for early education programs, with staff wages and benefits the main expenses. To meet the true cost of care, research shows tuition for center-based infant care would have to rise between $5,000 and $17,000 a year, something most Granite State parents cannot afford. In 2024, tuition averaged $16,000 a year for infants. 
While funding sources like the Child Care Development Fund and programs like the New Hampshire Child Care Scholarship help diversify revenue, they are not sufficient on their own. The Carsey School found that more attention toward alternative funding streams, such as partnering with the private sector and engaging with non-early education stakeholders, can lead to “a sustainable statewide ECE system.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/childcarehands-1024x623.jpg,,,2026-01-22 15:36:36.850932

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Legislation passed out of an Iowa House subcommittee Thursday would have the state’s public universities seek accreditation from a new body, formed by other higher education institutions, that has yet to see recognition from the federal government.
House Study Bill 550 would require the Iowa Board of Regents to direct the universities it governs to apply for accreditation by the Commission for Public Higher Education and to take necessary steps to achieve it.
The Commission for Public Higher Education was launched in June of last year, developed by the State University System of Florida, the University System of Georgia, the University of North Carolina System, the University of South Carolina System, the Texas A&M University System, and the University of Tennessee System.
According to its website, the commission is guided in its work of accrediting colleges by focusing on student outcomes, utilizing peer-to-peer review for universities and reducing “unnecessary bureaucracy, opacity, and expense.”

Iowa Board of Regents State Relations Officer Jillian Carlson noted in her comments to the subcommittee that the Commission for Public Higher Education has yet to be recognized by the U.S. Department of Education, a process she said the commission hopes to complete by 2027, with no guarantees.
It would also charge universities fees for membership where the Higher Learning Commission — through which Iowa’s public universities are registered — is free.
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law last year legislation that struck references to the Higher Learning Commission in code and replaced it with “any federal recognized accreditor of postsecondary educational institutions.” Democrats in the Iowa Senate said at the time the legislation could lead to universities turning to lower-quality accreditors and the deterioration of higher education in Iowa.
Rep. Ross Wilburn, D-Ames, said during the subcommittee meeting he would not sign the bill, as “it just sounds premature” to him. Subcommittee chair Rep. John Wills, R-Spirit Lake, and Rep. Jeff Shipley, R-Birmingham, approved the legislation to head to committee.
“I think we’ll move this forward just to have this conversation continue,” Wills said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-22 20:32:15+00:00,CT Mirror,Sen. Chris Murphy went to Texas. ICE didn’t offer a warm welcome.,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/22/sen-chris-murphy-ice-texas/,Chris Murphy tried to go inside two detention centers operated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement but was denied entry on Tuesday.,"After weeks of warning about the Trump administration’s escalating immigration crackdown, U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy flew to south Texas this week to see the enforcement efforts firsthand.
The Connecticut Democrat, who made the trek on his own, tried to go inside two detention centers operated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but he said he was denied entry on Tuesday. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security requires members of Congress to give seven days’ notice of a visit, a policy that is being challenged in court and has been temporarily upheld.
On Wednesday, he sat in on proceedings for individuals and families seeking asylum at an immigration court in San Antonio. He described the scenes inside as “bone-chilling,” noting the hallway right outside of the courtroom was lined with ICE officers.
Over the two-day trip, Murphy gave a play-by-play over social media of his whereabouts in south Texas: his attempts to get inside ICE detention centers, attending immigration court hearings and meeting with families with young children who were recently detained. In an interview, he said the reason for his visit to Texas specifically was because he believes the “abuse is most acute” around San Antonio.
Murphy said he provided more than 24 hours’ notice before his arrival to tour the facilities on Tuesday. He was ultimately barred from getting into two detention centers in Dilley and Pearsall, both about an hour and half southwest of San Antonio.
Calling it “patently illegal,” he said the denials impede congressional oversight, which he believes is even more pertinent given his role as the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee. That panel oversees and funds the overall department, which has jurisdiction over ICE.

“I wasn’t sure that I was going to be turned away. I didn’t show up unannounced. I gave them a day and half notice. I am the ranking Democrat on the committee that funds DHS. They had no reason to turn me away. And the fact that they did gives me an idea that they’re trying to hide something,” Murphy said in an interview Thursday.
“It was more evidence of how critical this moment is and how DHS does not deserve to be funded without reforms,” he continued. 
Tensions with ICE have become even more strained after the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis by a federal agent earlier this month.
Multiple Democratic members of Congress have tried to get into ICE detention centers around the country, including the most recent attempts by three lawmakers from Minnesota. 
Last month, a federal judge temporarily blocked a Trump administration policy that required members of Congress to provide at least seven days’ notice before entering such facilities. But after an emergency hearing, followed by the denial of the trio of Minnesota lawmakers, the judge ruled that a similar policy blocking unannounced visits will remain in place.
When Murphy tried to enter on Tuesday, DHS noted the 7-day policy on notification and told him that all facilities in the area are being completely funded by Republicans’ “big beautiful bill,” which allocated $75 billion over four years for ICE. They claimed that was a reason they didn’t have to follow appropriations law regarding congressional oversight.
“If they are not letting members of Congress in with less than seven days’ notice, it tells you how much work they know they need to do to cover up and hide the things they don’t want us to see,” Murphy said over social media. “You get to see the videos of what’s happening in Minneapolis. You don’t get to see anything that’s happening behind these walls.”
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday afternoon.
DHS issued a memo on Jan. 8 instituting a new policy that mirrored a past one requiring notification of at least a week.
“The basis for this policy is that advance notice is necessary to ensure adequate protection for Members of Congress, congressional staff, detainees, and ICE employees alike. Unannounced visits require pulling ICE officers away from their normal duties. Moreover, there is an increasing trend of replacing legitimate oversight activities with circus-like publicity stunts, all of which creates a chaotic environment with heightened emotions,” the memo reads.
While he didn’t get to tour either facility, Murphy said he spoke with some of the people who run them. At South Texas ICE Processing Center in Pearsall, Murphy was told there are 1,800 people at that facility, with 5% of them considered security threats, with convictions or arrests for violent crimes.
Murphy also met with two families who were recently detained in Texas. Both had young kids and were going through the court-ordered process as they apply for asylum when they were detained by federal agents.
“What they described is fundamentally un-American,” he said. “It’s fundamentally inhumane.”
On Wednesday, he sat in on proceedings at an immigration court in San Antonio for about two hours. Murphy said he received an urgent request from lawyers and advocates who knew he was in town. They asked him to sit in on one of the hearings of a young couple with a 2-year-old daughter, hoping that the presence of a U.S. senator would make detainment less likely. Murphy said he helped walk the family out of the courtroom and to their car.
But that wasn’t the case for another individual whose hearing Murphy also sat in on. The senator said the man didn’t have legal representation, but the judge ordered him to finish his asylum paperwork and return in a year. Despite the permission he got to remain in the country during that time, Murphy said the man was immediately apprehended by ICE officers when he exited the courtroom, though he wasn’t sure about his whereabouts after that happened.
This week’s trip was much different from the one he took to the southern border in 2023. That visit was with a bipartisan group of senators who were looking for a compromise to reform the immigration system. That led to Murphy negotiating a bipartisan border bill a year later, which ultimately fell apart after Donald Trump’s opposition.
Since Trump’s return to office, Murphy’s role in the U.S. Senate has evolved. He has become a vocal critic of the administration’s immigration crackdown, which he argues isn’t focusing on dangerous and violent criminals.
One of the ways Murphy and other Democrats have sought accountability for ICE is through the congressional appropriations process and placing limits on the enforcement agency through the budget of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE among many other offices.
In the days leading up to the compromise bill, Murphy signaled he wouldn’t be able to support a bill without certain reforms or guardrails surrounding ICE.
Congress is finishing its work to fund the rest of the federal government before its Jan. 30 deadline. One of the biggest obstacles to averting a partial shutdown is the bill that funds DHS. A growing number of congressional Democrats have wanted to defund or add in reforms.
Now that he’s seen the final proposal, Murphy said he won’t vote for it when it comes over to the Senate.
Other Connecticut Democrats have since come out against the DHS funding bill, including U.S. Rep. John Larson, D-1st District, U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District, and U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, who helped negotiate the spending bills. Republicans have a narrow margin in the House but can still pass funding bills without Democrats’ help. If the funding package makes it to the Senate, Republicans will need the votes of some Democrats to move them forward.
As the House takes up the DHS funding bill Thursday, most Democrats are expected to oppose it. If it clears the House, the measure will move over to the Senate next week. But senators won’t get the chance to vote separately on the DHS measure, which will be included in a larger package to fund the remaining three government funding bills. That could raise the possibility of a partial government shutdown.
Murphy said he can’t get support funding for Homeland Security without reforms — and the bill coming before Congress falls short of that threshold. Some of those demands that didn’t make it into the final product included preventing U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents from being moved off the border and into the interior, requiring warrants for certain arrests and protocol around mandatory training.
“We shouldn’t let Republicans bully us again into funding a lawless administration,” Murphy said Thursday. “I just don’t think we will be perceived as credible if we vote to fund DHS’ illegality and abuse for the rest of the year while talking like it’s a moral and legal crisis.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4629-1024x898.jpeg,,,2026-01-22 15:36:36.850932

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)When they were shopping for health insurance in 2024, University of New Mexico doctoral student Lazarus Letcher, 33, intentionally chose the Blue Cross Blue Shield’s “gold” plan from the state’s health care marketplace because it lowered the cost of their prescribed testosterone to $20. Letcher used the plan in all of 2025 without any issue, and planned to roll it over into 2026.
This January, they learned the medication would no longer be covered, and neither would a hysterectomy planned for this year.
“It felt like the rug was pulled out from under me,” Letcher said. “This is a medication I’ve taken with no side effects for 10 years, much to the benefit of my physical and mental health, and to have it suddenly not covered overnight was really confusing and anxiety-provoking.”
Local LGBTQ groups began warning people shortly before marketplace BeWell’s Jan. 15 deadline that two insurers were no longer covering gender-affirming care, such as testosterone and surgeries.
Plans reviewed by Source NM show that United HealthCare and Blue Cross Blue Shield, both of which can be purchased on BeWell, would no longer cover “any pharmaceutical or surgical intervention that is provided for the purpose of attempting to align an individual’s physical appearance or body with an asserted identity that differs from the individual’s sex,” with both plans using identical language.
Amanda Douglas, the manager of business communications at Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico, declined to provide an interview, but said in a statement that the company is “committed to providing access to quality, cost-effective care.”
“We are here to support our members in a thoughtful way as we navigate these regulatory changes in compliance with federal, state and local laws,” Douglas wrote, adding that a “specialty team of customer advocates” is available to assist impacted customers.
Tracey Lempner, a spokesperson for United Healthcare, requested additional time for comment but did not provide a statement to Source NM prior to publication.
The policy change comes in a state that in 2023 enacted the Reproductive and Gender-Affirming Health Care Freedom Act, which protects health care rights for transgender people. The policy changes also come as the Trump administration assails transgender rights in myriad ways, including targeting insurance coverage for gender-affirming care.
New Mexico legally protects the trans community — but fear persists

New Mexico Transgender Resource Center Executive Director Adrien Lawyer told Source NM the insurance change appears to only affect marketplace-specific plans, which do not include Medicaid plans.
While that distinction likely means fewer New Mexicans are impacted, Lawyer said it appears to “fly in the face” of the state’s civil rights protections.
“People have worked here for 30 years to make New Mexico a safe place for LGBTQ people culturally, but also legislatively,” he told Source NM. “And that this was so easy for [insurance providers] to do feels like a big problem. It’s exposed a weakness to us for sure.”
Lawyer said LGBTQ organizations are continuing to weigh the next steps. In the meantime, he urged anyone using marketplace insurance to purchase plans from providers such as Presbyterian or Molina, which still cover gender-affirming care.
Gender-affirming care still legal in NM despite SCOTUS ruling, groups say

Letcher told Source NM they were counseled by Blue Cross Blue Shield to buy an “off-market plan” directly from their company. They’ve done so and are still waiting to see if their health needs will be covered.
Letcher, an avid birder, musician and writer, said the changes were particularly worrisome, since “New Mexico is seen as a safe haven for a lot of trans folks,” as other states continue to introduce and pass legislation limiting or banning gender-affirming care.
While Letcher says they could pay for some of their health care out of pocket, they said that is not the reality for many trans people.
“I’m more worried for folks that are early in their transition, that are just trying to begin their journey and get access to this life-saving medicine and then suddenly realizing that it’s out of reach,” they said.
Rep. Linda Serrato (D-Santa Fe), the lead sponsor for the Reproductive and Gender-Affirming Health Care Freedom Act, told Source NM in a recent interview that she would consider sponsoring legislation in the 30-day session that would require insurance companies to offer gender-affirming care.
The bill the state enacted into law in 2023 prevents government entities like counties and school boards from prosecuting for harming someone for seeking gender-affirming care, but does not address insurance companies.

However, Serrato said creating a new law that requires insurance companies to make gender-affirming care available will need to be carefully considered to take into account the pressure insurance companies may face from the Trump Administration’s efforts to ban funds for gender-affirming care.
An emailed response to questions from Source NM from Viara Ianakieva, life and health division director for the New Mexico Office of Superintendent of Insurance, noted that under current rules, “medically necessary care is covered unless specifically excluded by the plan.”
In the case of Blue Cross Blue Shield and United Health, those plans now exclude coverage for “sex trait modifications,” which, she said, is a more narrow category than gender-affirming care, which “is a broad category that is not currently defined.”
And “sex trait modification is no longer considered an Essential Health Benefit…under the recently issued federal rules.”
If New Mexico mandated such coverage, it would be required to pay for them. OSI, she said, “is actively  exploring  potential solutions” with the American Civil Liberties Union.
Serrato said the potential impacts of mandating coverage need to be taken into account. “If I’m proposing a piece of legislation that means a mass exodus of medical insurers, that doesn’t help anybody,” she said. “So we need to tailor something and make it clean and specific to protect as many people as possible.”

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s Rural Health Transformation Program budget bill along with four related policy bills passed their first floor votes in the Legislature Thursday morning.
The budget bill, House Bill 1623, is the reason the North Dakota Legislature reconvened this week for the special session. It gives the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services the authority to spend incoming federal Rural Health Transformation Program dollars.
The program was created by Congress last summer as part of its budget reconciliation bill. It was advertised as a way to partially make up for funding rural states will lose from Medicaid cuts included elsewhere in the legislation.
 
North Dakota Monitor special session coverage


North Dakota received $199 million from the federal government for the first year of the five-year program. Qualifying organizations will be able to apply for a slice of that funding in the coming months.
Rep. Todd Porter, R-Mandan, said on the House floor he thinks the money will make the greatest difference to the state’s strained health care workforce.
“We are hearing absolute horror stories across all of North Dakota, not just in the rural areas, of the shortages of EMS providers,” Porter, who owns an ambulance service, said. He said EMS services rely on a “system of volunteerism” that no longer exists.
Given his background, Porter declared a conflict of interest and was excused from voting on the legislation.
“I’m gonna be chasing this money myself,” he said.
The budget bill allows the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services the ability to spend roughly $397.9 million for the 2025-2027 budget cycle — the amount the state expects to receive for the first two years of the Rural Health Transformation Program.
Lawmakers also approved an amendment to the bill to enable the state-owned Bank of North Dakota to provide up to $40 million in stop-gap loans to approved grant applicants awaiting reimbursement from the federal government,
The bill passed the House by a vote of 90-2.
The two no votes came from Rep. Jeff Hoverson and Rep. Lori VanWinkle, both Minot Republicans.
“I think there’s a better way to go about rural health,” Hoverson said on the floor. “At some point, we’ve gotta stop saying ‘yes’ to federal dollars.”
Health care providers see grant bill as a way to expand services in North Dakota

In addition to the budget bill, legislators approved four policies that the Trump administration incentivized states to adopt by promising extra Rural Health Transformation Program money.
The federal government can rescind some of North Dakota’s award if the state doesn’t follow through with passing the proposals. Lawmakers said on the floor Thursday that based on scoring information provided by the federal government, they estimate that each policy gets the state a few extra million dollars each year in grant money. 
One proposed policy, Senate Bill 2402, would allow pharmacists to prescribe some medications to patients and order some lab tests.
Sen. Judy Lee, R-West Fargo, said the legislation would make it easier for North Dakotans to receive basic health care services.
“You can usually walk into a drugstore and find a pharmacist,” Lee said. “But you can’t always walk into the clinic and see the physician.”
The Senate approved an amendment to the bill that would require pharmacists to notify primary care providers of the results of any tests they perform and any prescriptions they write.
The amendment also puts restrictions on some of the prescriptive powers the bill would give pharmacists.
Senate Bill 2402 passed unanimously.
Another of the four policy proposals, Senate Bill 2401, would mandate that doctors receive one hour of education on nutrition and metabolic health as part of their continuing education. It passed in the Senate by a vote of 44-2.
The House on Thursday morning unanimously passed House Bill 1622, which allows the state to join a physician assistant licensure compact. 
It also voted 90-2 in favor of House Bill 1621, which would require North Dakota students to participate in the presidential physical fitness test. The bill as amended in committee on Wednesday allows the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction to set the criteria for the fitness test in coordination with the federal government. 
Rural hospital on the verge of shutting down could be saved by lawmaker’s bill

Also on Thursday, legislation proposed to support a hospital in danger of closing in Elgin passed the Senate unanimously.
Senate Bill 2403 would authorize the Bank of North Dakota to issue emergency operating loans of up to $5 million to nonprofit hospitals in financial distress. 
The Jacobson Memorial Hospital in Elgin is believed to be the only health care facility in the state that would meet the loan criteria, bill sponsor Sen. Donald Schaible, R-Mott, has said. An amendment reduced the bill’s funding from $10 million to $5 million. 
“This situation was unique. They made some mistakes, but now is not the time to point fingers,” Schaible said on the Senate floor Thursday. “We allowed the Bank of North Dakota to be the gatekeeper on reviewing these applications. They will do the deep dive into the financial situation to ensure that they are a viable product going forward.”
The bills will swap chambers Friday morning for another floor vote.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Florida will have to pay more to participate in the federal supplemental nutrition assistance program, often referred to as SNAP, due to changes in law enshrined in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
The administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis already has acknowledged the program will require an additional $50 million because Congress increased by 25% the state’s share of administrative costs to run the program that last year helped 1.5 million Florida households and 2.6 million people purchase food. 
The cost shift takes effect Oct. 1 and will have to be accounted for in the state operating budget the Legislature will pass this session.
The Department of Children and Families, though, is being tight-lipped about how much more it will be required to contribute in 2028. That’s when the provision in the the federal law that requires states with SNAP payment error rates of 6% or more to begin paying for a portion of the food costs. The higher the error rate, the more the state is required to contribute.
Florida’s error rate was 15.1% in 2024, a figure that would have required the state to contribute $1 billion to help cover the costs of the food had the mandates been in effect.
“Members, the department understands the seriousness of the SNAP payment error rate and the implications for the state. We have taken decisive data-driven action to strengthen quality control, improve oversight, modernize systems, and reinforce accountability while continuing to ensure eligible Floridians receive timely access to benefits,” DCF Deputy Assistant Secretary Jamie Dattoli told members of the House Health Care Budget Subcommittee this week. “You have my assurance and the department’s commitment that this work remains our top priority.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Dattoli said DCF won’t know its 2025 SNAP error rate until June. She discussed at length the steps the state is taking to lower its error rate, a number that includes both overpayments and underpayments, and accounts for mistakes made by the state as well as the person applying for the food assistance program.
Pensacola Republican Rep. Alex Andrade pressed for an 2025 error rate estimate, though, and Dattoli predicted it would be about 13%. 
Florida doesn’t plan on using its 2026 SNAP error for cost sharing calculations, Dattoli said, adding that the agency hopes to keep it below 6% in 2027.
Inside the error numbers
Again, to avoid any new federal cost sharing requirements a state’s SNAP error rate must be below 6%. States with error rates between 6% and 8% will be required to contribute 5% of the costs, and states with between 8% and 10% error rates would be required to cover 10% of the costs.
States with error rates above 10% have to contribute between 15% and 25% of the costs of the food.
As Dattoli’s testimony came to an end, Andrade asked whether it would be “reasonable to assume” that in 2028, when the cost sharing requirements kick in, Florida would be on the hook for at least 5% of the benefit (or $300 million). The question assumed Florida’s SNAP error rate could be lowered this year to somewhere between 6% and 8%.
Dattoli replied: “I don’t want to give you a number or a time frame. But just know [that] we truly understand the importance of — and our staff, our team, are working tirelessly to improve — that payment error rate and not have to owe any payment towards the benefit amount.”
Inside SNAP numbers
The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) reports that in fiscal year 2024, SNAP brought more than $6.6 billion to the state.
While the program helps feed children, it also provided benefits to more than 97,675 veterans in Florida in 2024, FRAC says. And 44% of SNAP households in Florida in 2024 included a person with a developmental or intellectual disability.
Sophie Collyer, research director for the Center on Poverty and Social Policy Research at Columbia University, tracks SNAP’s role in reducing poverty rates. 
Her research shows that 203,000 Florida residents were lifted out of poverty because of SNAP in 2024, of whom 81,000 were children under age 18.
Appearing durring a Kairos Center for Religions, Rights, and Social Justice press conference on Thursday, Collyer said long-term research shows SNAP benefits help improve peoples’ health, increase children’s test scores, reduce criminal justice system involvement, and increase children’s long-term education attainment and subsequent earnings in adulthood.
“Our team at Columbia decided to calculate all the long-term benefits associated with SNAP and compare those to the costs of the program. And we found for every $1 spent on SNAP, the benefits to society amount to $14 in these long-term aggregate benefits,” she said.
DeSantis administration: We need another $50M to cover SNAP costs

New Disabled South founder and President Dom Kelly said people with disabilities living in the South, particularly children, disproportionately rely on SNAP for food assistance. When they lose access it, he said, they are more likely to develop co-morbidities and are significantly more likely to die at younger ages.
When SNAP benefits were temporarily terminated in November due to the federal shutdown, the organization set up a fund to give cash payments to people with disabilities living in the states it serves.
“So, we received $4.1 million in applications for more than 18,500 disabled people across our region. We were able to send out $200,000 worth of those payments, which means that we barely scratched the surface of the need,” said Kelly, who also participated in the Kairos press conference.
Kelly said New Disabled South received 887 applications from SNAP beneficiaries in Florida with intellectual and developmental disabilities and sent out $10,050 in payments to people located in Florida.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/food-stamps-sign.jpg,,,2026-01-22 15:36:36.850932

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) announced a tentative agreement on providing state funding to WisconsinEye, the nonprofit that provides livestream coverage of state government. 
It’s been a little over a month since WisconsinEye, which launched in 2007, halted its coverage of legislative hearings, floor sessions and other state government business due to financial difficulties. Since WisEye shut down, the state Capitol has held dozens of committee hearings without any being livestreamed and archived, and members of the public have been prohibited from recording or livestreaming. Only credentialed media has been allowed to record activity. 
Vos and Neubauer announced the agreement during a joint press conference on Thursday. According to Neubauer, the agreement will include an endowment, funded with the $10 million that lawmakers first set aside for WisconsinEye in 2023, as well as requirements that WisconsinEye fundraise to cover some operational costs. 
“The interest will go to WisconsinEye each year so that they can fund the majority of their Capitol operations,” Neubauer said. “This is a really good start. It’s very important for the public to have access, and so we’re optimistic that we’re going to reach a bipartisan solution here soon.” 
Vos said legislators also want to sign a short-term contract with WisconsinEye so the organization can broadcast the February floor period. 
“We’ll hopefully turn that into a longer term contract where we provide them limited funding,” Vos said. “I think it’s a win-win for all.”
As of Thursday, the Assembly will have met four times on the floor without livestreamed or  archived coverage of the sessions. The Senate has met once with a livestream facilitated by the Legislative Technology Services Bureau. 
The Wisconsin Supreme Court has announced plans to livestream its upcoming oral arguments on the Wisconsin Court System’s website.
“The idea of having one network and one operation for the courts and another for the Legislature, another for the executive branch, certainly is going to cost more than any amount we would give WisconsinEye,” Vos said. “They’ve already done a pretty good job. We’re going to make sure that they’re financially stable, and hopefully they continue doing the work that they’ve already done.”
Vos said that under the tentative agreement, $10 million in state funds would go into a trust fund and the interest accrued from it would be given to a “revamped” board of directors. He said it would be “still transparent and private.”
The $10 million in state funds was initially set aside in the state budget for the organization to use to build a permanent endowment, but it came with a requirement that WisconsinEye raise equivalent matching funds. The organization hasn’t raised enough money to access the funds. In the weeks since shutting down, WisconsinEye launched a GoFundMe that has raised nearly $50,000 from more than 260 donations.
Neubauer said that the interest from the trust fund is not expected to cover the organization’s nearly $1 million annual budget, so there is an expectation that it would raise a few hundred thousand dollars each year.  
“They have said they are able to do [that] and are optimistic,” Neubauer said. 
Neubauer said there will also be a few other provisions related to additional transparency in the organization’s operations and reporting to the Legislature. 
The agreement would also need support from the state Senate. Vos said there was a good discussion on Thursday morning, that Assembly leaders “probably are more in sync” than their counterparts in the other house of the Legislature.
“I think they’re still working through some of the details of how they’d like to work, and that’s why we don’t have a finalized agreement,” Vos said. “We wanted to get the bill out there, start the idea. If they have a different concept, we’ll certainly go through to finalize it, but I think at least based on my discussions this morning, I feel like all four of us are in a similar place. I think our caucuses, we’d like to have some kind of access, it’s just what’s the best vehicle to do it.”
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) told reporters on Wednesday that his caucus believes “that giving the public access to see what we’re doing is important, but… just blindly giving money to an organization that’s asking us for money, but not giving us any answers, is certainly not the solution at this time.” Lawmakers had sent questions to WisconsinEye requesting information on its operations and didn’t receive answers until about 12 days after the deadline.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — A South Dakota Senate committee unanimously voted Thursday to advance legislation that removes silencers from the state’s definition of a controlled weapon.
Unregistered possession of a controlled weapon is a felony, which could result in two years of jail time.
“State regulation is unnecessary,” said Sen. Casey Crabtree, a Republican from Madison who introduced the legislation and is seeking the Republican nomination for U.S. House. “Gun suppressors are not weapons. They are simply hearing protection.”
A suppressor quiets the reports from gunfire, and supporters of deregulation say it’s a hearing protection measure for hunters and people in the surrounding area. Opponents of deregulation, including the national organization Everytown for Gun Safety, say silencers make it harder for bystanders or law enforcement to identify and react quickly to gunshots.
Nobody testified against the bill Thursday.

Republican Attorney General Marty Jackley supports the legislation. Listing a silencer as a controlled weapon, he said, “doesn’t promote or help public safety.”
There are already protections in place at the federal level, he said.
“It’s simply extra government that doesn’t achieve any result,” Jackley told the committee.
Brian Gosch, a lobbyist who spoke on behalf of the National Rifle Association, said there’s also the “good neighbor aspect” to consider.
“If you have a suppressed AR, that’s going to be quieter for the neighbors,” he said, referring to AR-style rifles. “If we’re all out shooting suppressed shotguns in the field, we’re going to be able to communicate a lot better like that.”
The bill now goes to the full Senate.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The University of Nebraska and Clarkson Regional Health Services are replacing nearly all members of the Nebraska Medicine Board of Directors as NU moves forward with an $800 million deal for sole ownership of the nonprofit medical provider.
The restructuring could end a lawsuit pursued by the Nebraska Medicine board to stop the deal. A majority of four new voting members, all NU and Clarkson leaders, support the deal.
“[NU and Clarkson] have since determined that this action was necessary to protect the organization’s reputation, stability, and future, and to ensure it can continue to fulfill its charitable mission effectively long into the future,” NU and Clarkson said in a joint statement.
Legal fights escalate
The NU Board of Regents announced in a Thursday news release that it, along with Clarkson, had filed new articles of incorporation for Nebraska Medicine with the Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office. The amended articles were filed shortly after 8 a.m. Thursday. NU and Clarkson have overseen the nonprofit hospital and clinic partner of the University of Nebraska Medical Center in a 50-50 split since 1997.
The NU-Clarkson transaction includes NU paying Clarkson $500 million for its 50% stake in the nonprofit, plus $300 million for related properties. The deal is expected to close by June 30.
After the transaction finishes, Clarkson has pledged to donate $200 million back to NU for “Project Health,” a $2.19 billion endeavor to build up the next generation of health care.
Regents say the Nebraska Medicine changes are needed because NU and Clarkson “have serious concerns about recent actions and behavior” of previous Nebraska Medicine board members. NU and Clarkson argue those actions “threatened critically important mission-driven strategic initiatives.” 
The NU regents on Jan. 8 asked the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office to investigate the nonprofit board, too.
“We have initiated a thorough review of these allegations,” an AG’s Office spokesperson said in a text last week. “Any investigation our office conducts will remain strictly confidential.”
Nebraska Medicine suing to stop $800 million NU-Clarkson deal for NU sole ownership

The Nebraska Medicine board, before the changes, pushed back on those claims before and said they had “no merit” and said they were an effort to distract from questions about the NU-Clarkson deal. The former board members said they had been left out of meaningful negotiations, including a possible alternative.
In a statement last week issued by the nonprofit’s former leadership, the board said it “must uphold its fiduciary duties to Nebraska Medicine, and our opposition to and questions about the regents’ transaction fully [align] with that duty.”
‘Transformative transaction’
According to the joint statements Thursday, NU and Clarkson said they desired to complete the “transformative transaction” without board changes. They say the changes came after a “careful review of current circumstances,” Nebraska Medicine’s governing documents and the law.
The four voting members will be:

Dr. Jeffrey Gold, president of NU since July 2024 who previously served as chancellor of the University of Nebraska Center beginning in 2014.
Dr. Dele Davies, interim UNMC chancellor who will chair the “interim” board.
Dr. Bill Lydiatt, a retired surgeon and CEO of Clarkson Regional Health Services.
Stephanie Moline, a current Clarkson board member and retired executive vice president of First National Bank Omaha.

Only Davies was actively on the board before Thursday. Gold was a member during his time as UNMC chancellor, starting as the inaugural board chair in 2016.
NU regents unanimously approve $800M Clarkson deal for Nebraska Medicine

There will also be four nonvoting members who all previously served on the Nebraska Medicine board by virtue of their positions. They are the dean of the UNMC College of Medicine, chair of surgery in the UNMC College of Medicine, Nebraska Medicine’s chief nursing officer and chief of staff of The Nebraska Medical Center medical staff.
The changes remove Nebraska Medicine’s CEO, Dr. Michael Ash, and seven other members, including Lance Fritz, the previous chair, who led opposition to the NU-Clarkson changes. 
Fritz, who was president and CEO of Union Pacific between 2015 and 2023, did not immediately return a call seeking comment Thursday.
‘Came out of left field’
The day before the vote last week, NU and Nebraska Medicine hosted competing forums with state lawmakers on the deal. In the wake of Thursday’s board restructuring, multiple senators said they needed to review what had happened before commenting.
State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln called the board changes the “nuclear option.” Another senator said it was like adding gasoline to a fire.

Multiple senators described the situation as a “clash of the titans,” which was only made public Jan. 2 after strict non-disclosure agreements. The deal proceeded in less than two weeks. 
State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, a former hospital administrator, said he worried about impacts to the Omaha philanthropic community.
State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area proposed Legislative Bill 1215 this year at Nebraska Medicine’s urging. It would require any such NU deals for hospitals above $100 million to obtain legislative approval. 
Thursday’s action might increase pressure for lawmakers to step in.
“Came out of left field,” Sorrentino said Thursday of the board restructuring.

A Minnesota lawyer called out-of-state transfers an ICE tactic to ""disappear"" communities.","At least 40 immigrants ICE arrested in Minneapolis in recent weeks are being detained at the Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia, three detainees told Source New Mexico. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Dozens of immigrants currently housed at a New Mexico detention facility arrived there recently from the Minneapolis area, the site of a massive federal immigration operation and intensifying protests.
Three detainees at the Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia told Source New Mexico in phone interviews Wednesday evening that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested them separately in Minnesota on or around Jan. 5 before quickly flying them to a detention facility in El Paso, which was rapidly filling with new arrestees as they stayed there for several days. 
On Jan. 11, officers woke them up around 4 a.m. and bussed about 40 of them to Estancia, a journey that required detainees to be awake for 24 hours, detainee Jorge Cordoba told Source. Everyone on the bus to Estancia was arrested in Minneapolis or nearby, he said. 
Cordoba, 33, said he has lived in Minneapolis for more than 20 years and lives in the United States legally under protected Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival status granted to immigrants who arrived here as children. His parents brought him here from Mexico when he was 10, he said. 
50 NM immigrant detainees say mail issues at jail hurting their legal cases  

“My wife is a U.S. citizen. I have four kids,” he said. “I’ve been a pretty good citizen. It’s been more than 10 years since I got a speeding ticket.”
Cordoba’s protected status didn’t stop an ICE agent from arresting him around 4:30 a.m. Jan. 5 on his way to work at a humidity control company, he said. ICE agents took him to a temporary detention facility in the city and, by 10 p.m. that night, Cordoba was already in El Paso, he said. 
While Source could not independently corroborate his account, Innovation Law Lab, an immigrant legal advocacy group, provided details of its own interviews with recent jail arrivals, including one account that matches Cordoba’s. 
Now Cordoba remains in New Mexico awaiting a hearing before a judge to demonstrate that he still has DACA status.
“I’m stuck here,” he said. 
Irina Vaynerman, a Minnesota-based lawyer with the organization Groundwork Legal, told Source on Thursday that ICE is deliberately shipping detainees to far-away facilities to deprive them of legal access and family support. 
Her organization is seeking a federal judge’s order to return one of her clients from New Mexico. In a legal filing Wednesday, she argued that “Oscar O.T.”, a Guatemalan man seeking asylum, is being denied constitutional due process and that his transfer to New Mexico violates a judicial order that he be able to face a judge in Minnesota. 
“This is just part of a much bigger story about not just the unlawful detentions that are happening, but on top of that, the intentional evading of the court’s orders and court’s jurisdiction,” she said.
Torrance County ICE contract extension ‘likely improper and invalid,’ NMDOJ says

She said ICE shipping detainees out-of-state prevents “individuals who have been unlawfully detained from being able to connect with local counsel and file the legal actions they need to be able to get free.”
In Oscar’s case, she said, ICE’s system for lawyers to track their clients was not working, so they had no clue where he was until she got an email from ICE saying he was being held in “Albuquerque.” 
No ICE detention facility exists in Albuquerque, so Vayneman said it’s possible he is actually in Estancia, an hour or so away from Albuquerque, and was bussed there along with fellow Minneapolis residents from El Paso. 
“That is the type of insanity that is going on, the intentional disappearing of Minnesotans who have been unlawfully detained,” she said. “It is genuinely the government’s effort to try to erase entire swaths of the U.S. population in an unlawful way.”
An ICE spokesperson did not respond to Source’s request for comment about why the agency would hold Minneapolis arrestees in Estancia. A spokesperson for CoreCivic, which owns and operates the facility, referred Source’s request for comment to ICE.
It’s not clear exactly how many Minneapolis arrestees are held in Estancia. Tiffany Wang, a lawyer with Innovation Law Lab, told Source on Wednesday that a “decent number” of roughly 100 detainees the group spoke with last week were from Minnesota. The Portland-based immigrant legal advocacy group does weekly jail visits. 
Wang said her best guess as to why ICE would select Estancia is that the jail has space, following a reduction in detainees that coincided with a two-month-long contract expiration between ICE and CoreCivic late last year. She noted that many detainees previously arrived there from a makeshift ICE facility in the Florida Everglades known as “Alligator Alcatraz.”
“TCDF just has served as this holding place for people caught in other states, and sent here with really no regard to the family that they have in other places or with the attorneys that they may have in their home states, or anything,” she said.
NM governor will include proposed ban on immigrant detention on legislative agenda

The Legislature is currently considering a ban on public entities like Torrance County from contracting with ICE and CoreCivic for the purpose of immigrant detention. One reason lawmakers cite is to prevent public bodies from being complicit in President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push in New Mexico and across the country. 
A New Mexico House committee is scheduled to take up the bill Thursday afternoon.
Cordoba, along with fellow Estancia detainees Cirilo Figueroa and Felix Garcia, all told Source they worry most about their families more than 1,200 miles away in Minnesota amid protests and an immigration crackdown that have seized the city. Like Cordoba, Garcia and Figueroa said they’ve lived in the city more than 20 years. Garcia, 59, has 12 grandchildren, as well as a nephew whom ICE briefly detained despite him being a US citizen, he said. 
All have watched local news reports from inside the jail showing the chaos in their hometown, they said, and described feeling powerless to help their families from so far away. 
“It’s not fair,” Cordoba said, his voice cracking, “what’s happening.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_3109-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-22 15:36:36.850932

“This is a preliminary step necessary for any candidate considering a run,” according to a person close to the senator who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. “The senator will make an announcement of her plans in the coming days.”
Klobuchar, 65, is a proven vote-getter, having been reelected three times since first winning her seat in 2006. In 2012, she won all but two of the state’s 87 counties — a stunning victory in a purplish state where conservative rural counties far outnumber the more populated metropolitan area ones. Her margin of victory has narrowed over time, perhaps reflecting political changes in Minnesota and nationwide.
In recent weeks, Klobuchar has been an opponent of the recent federal immigration surge in Minnesota, calling for a federal investigation into the killing of Renee Good by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross and calling ICE’s arrest of children “disgraceful.”
“How can anyone justify this anymore?” Klobuchar posted on X.
Klobuchar is a relentless campaigner — visiting every Minnesota county every year — and focuses on broadly popular, often bipartisan legislation like funding rural broadband infrastructure, banning lead in children’s products and expanding services for victims of human trafficking.
Klobuchar’s candidacy has relieved some Democratic donors and operatives anxious that the fraud scandal that tanked Walz’s reelection campaign would cost them control of state government.
In 2020, Klobuchar ran for president, pitching herself as a moderate Democrat, announcing her candidacy in the middle of a snowstorm. National scrutiny led to reports that she is a formidable boss, including an allegation that she hurled office supplies in frustration.
Prior to Super Tuesday, Klobuchar suspended her presidential campaign and endorsed Joe Biden.
A slew of Republicans have entered the race for governor, including House Speaker Lisa Demuth, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, former congressional candidate Kendall Qualls and attorney Chris Madel.

The Michigan Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly passed Senate Bill 495 and its House Bill 4141 companion, restricting student cell phone use during all instructional time.
The House last week passed its version of the bills with Democrats on board this time. That was not the case when the bill came before the chamber last year, killed at the height of a contentious budget season.
Michigan House Republicans kick off 2026 with renewed vote on school cell phone ban

There were murmurs of a deal between leading Republican proponent Rep. Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester Hills), who told Michigan Advance last year that he and Sen. Dayna Polehanki (D-Livonia) had an understanding of how to get the bills to the governor’s office in a bipartisan manner. Polehanki denied that was the case after Democrats voted against the measure in the House last year and Republicans couldn’t muster the votes to save it.
Fast forward to the opening salvo of this year’s Senate and House sessions: Tisdel tried again and the HB 4141 passed 99-10 on Jan. 14, and was sent to the Senate for swift consideration.
The Senate passed Tisdel’s bill 34-1 on Thursday, as well as Polehanki’s SB 495, which passed by the same margin.
In a statement, Polehanki said she and Tisdel were able to forge a compromise last week.
“As a former teacher, I know firsthand how much student cell phone use impedes the ability to focus and learn in the classroom. While my legislative colleagues and I have long agreed that addressing this issue is critical for Michigan kids, we’ve had to work together across the aisle to find common ground on a bicameral solution that best meets the needs of our schools — and I’m proud that we’ve successfully been able to do just that,” said Polehanki, chair of the Senate Education Committee, in a statement. 
Polehanki added that passage was “a win that will not only make a positive difference in our classrooms but also show the people of Michigan that despite our political differences, we can come together and deliver bipartisan solutions to the problems facing our state.”

(Photo courtesy of the CDC)North Carolina is now seeing local transmission of measles.
The state has reported 11 cases of measles since December, mainly in the western part of the state. In most cases, the patients had visited South Carolina, where a substantial outbreak of measles is underway.
However, the North Carolina Dept. of Health and Human Services says there’s now at least one case of community spread, and low vaccination rates could put some counties at risk of more.
Measles is a highly contagious disease that can be easily spread when someone who has the virus talks, coughs or sneezes near others. Remarkably, the virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after a person infected with measles leaves the room.
Epidemiologists say a vaccination rate of 95% is needed to stop community spread of measles. About half the counties in North Carolina don’t meet that threshold.
According to the state’s measles vaccination dashboard, three counties are below 90%: Durham County is tied with Cherokee County for the lowest vaccination rates among children at just 88%, and Polk County rounds out the bottom three with 89%. More than 40 other counties fall below 95%, including Wake, Mecklenburg and Guilford.
UNC Professor of Medicine and infectious disease expert Dr. David Wohl told NC Newsline last fall that the effectiveness of the measles vaccine was a great triumph. Unfortunately, some parents still decide not to vaccinate their children.
“And we are seeing somebody come in from another place where measles is endemic and infecting people, then it spreads like wildfire,” said Wohl.
Of the eleven reported cases in North Carolina, 64% were unvaccinated and 34% had received only one dose of the MMR vaccine, according to NCDHHS.
The disease can be especially dangerous for babies and young children. Complications can include pneumonia and encephalitis or swelling of the brain. Symptoms of measles begin 7-21 days after exposure. They can include high fever, cough, white spots inside the mouth, and a blotchy rash that begins on the face.
Anyone who develops symptoms is urged to contact their local health department, limit their exposure to others, and call ahead before visiting their doctor or the emergency room to avoid exposing others, according to NCDHHS..
Grandparents for Vaccines, a national non-partisan group, is also working to sound the alarm about unvaccinated children.
“Measles is not a harmless childhood illness. It is a dangerous virus that can cause lifelong injury or death,” said Dr. Arthur Lavin, a retired pediatrician and the founder of the nonprofit. “Before vaccines, children were often hospitalized or permanently harmed. As a grandparent, it is heartbreaking to see preventable suffering return.”
Most people who do get vaccinated with MMR will be protected for life.
Earlier this month, NCDHHS launched a new Measles Cases and Outbreaks dashboard to provide the public with updated information. The dashboard is updated twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays.
As of Thursday, North Carolina had recorded cases of measles in Buncombe (6), Rutherford (1), Polk (2), and Cabarrus County (2).
Since December, cases of measles have been reported in Buncombe, Rutherford, Polk, and Cabarrus County. (Map: NCDHHS)",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Measles_Rash-cdc-1024x579.jpg,,,2026-01-22 15:36:36.850932

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — A South Dakota state representative was reassigned to different committees recently after tempers flared over a committee’s seating arrangement, in an episode one lawmaker described as “unprofessional and juvenile behavior.”
Republican leaders removed Rep. Phil Jensen, R-Rapid City, who chairs the Freedom Caucus, from the House Education Committee following his role in an upheaval on Friday stemming from a new seating arrangement created by the committee chair, Rep. Lana Greenfield, R-Doland. 
The argument about the seating arrangement delayed the committee by more than 15 minutes, said House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish.
Odenbach told members of the media at a leadership press conference Thursday that Jensen and some other members of the House Education Committee planned “an effort to disrupt the committee,” which is “unacceptable behavior.” Republican leaders pulled the members from the room to “deal with the issue out of sight” of the public.
Jensen was the only lawmaker involved who was reassigned.
Jensen lost his vice chairmanship of the House Education Committee last year for introducing a bill to defund the Huron School District, which he filed in reaction to a tip about the district’s bathroom policy regarding transgender students. The 18-year lawmaker served on the education committee in the House or Senate for nearly a decade.

Jensen alleged to South Dakota Searchlight that the Republican legislative leadership has “declared war on conservatives.” He said the new seating arrangement isolated conservative legislators from each other. House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, “threw” Jensen and other members of the committee “under the bus” by siding with the chair, Jensen alleged.
“The speaker chose to support an out-of-control chairman who instructed committee members last session to stop talking with each other and forbid them from using their phones to communicate on how they were voting on bills,” Jensen said in an emailed statement, adding that he and some other members were treated “as children.”
In a statement to South Dakota Searchlight, Hansen said he is “responsible for maintaining order” in the Legislature.
“I cannot allow any member to disrupt official proceedings over a seating assignment,” Hansen said. “This incident had nothing to do with conservative principles — principles I have consistently led on throughout my time in the Legislature. It was about addressing unprofessional and juvenile behavior, and I handled it appropriately to preserve the integrity of our institution.”
Greenfield, a former teacher, said a “new seating chart for a new year” makes sense.
“It’s nice to visit with other people, and sometimes it’s good to hear different perspectives,” Greenfield said. “As a teacher, it was something I normally did.”
Legislative rules allow committee chairs to determine seating charts, Odenbach said. He added that lawmakers who don’t agree with the rule should have tried to change the rules at the beginning of the legislative session or discussed the matter with the chair.
“The way you definitely don’t do it is try to disrupt the proceedings of the House of Representatives,” Odenbach said.
Odenbach said he doesn’t “expect anything else like that to happen” this legislative session, which began earlier this month and continues until March.



New committee assignments
House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, announced several committee reassignments recently:

Rep. Phil Jensen, R-Rapid City, was reassigned from the Education and Transportation committees to the Local Government and Taxation committees after he argued about seating assignments in the Education Committee.
Rep. Liz May, R-Kyle, was reassigned from the House Appropriations Committee to the Agriculture and Natural Resources and Education committees, which Odenbach said was due to a recent accident on her ranch that limited her ability to devote the extra time required of Appropriations Committee members.
Rep. Julie Auch, R-Yankton, was reassigned from the Agriculture and Natural Resources and Local Government committees to the House Appropriations Committee to replace May.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa House Democrats released a proposal Thursday aimed at improving the quality of Iowa’s drinking water and waterways through increased monitoring and more incentives for farmers and landowners to implement best practices.
Water quality has been a major topic in the state among environmental advocates for years, who have warned about the impacts of farm runoff and chemicals like PFAS in the state’s water. But these concerns have been further elevated in the past year as central Iowa faced elevated nitrate levels in the Des Moines and Raccoon rivers in 2025.
The “Iowa Healthy Water Act” is House Democrats’ proposal to tackle water quality concerns throughout the state. The measure, which was not yet available on the Legislature’s website, includes five components, Democrats said at a Thursday news conference.

The proposal would establish a $600,000 statewide water monitoring program, led by Regents institutions including the Iowa Flood Center, with information accessible through a public, statewide dashboard.
In October 2025, Polk County supervisors voted to invest $200,000 to fund the state’s monitoring system, the Iowa Water Quality Information System, or IWQIS, led by the University of Iowa that was set to end in the summer of 2026 due to lapsed funding diverted in 2023. Democrats’ proposal would provide the full amount estimated for the system to be fully operational.
Rep. Kenan Judge, D-Waukee, said this funding was necessary if the state wants ensure the effectiveness of any efforts to improve water quality.
“If we’re leaders, we need to come out and we should oversee water,” Judge said. “It shouldn’t be a mishmash of testing. If we cannot measure it, we cannot manage it.”
The Iowa Department of Natural Resources also monitors water quality and provides assessments on sections of Iowa waterways every other year as mandated by the Clean Water Act. However, some advocates say more monitoring is necessary, with citizen scientists providing additional testing through groups like the Nitrate Watch program.
The House Democrats’ proposal also calls for the state to triple its funding — from $10 million to $30 million — for Iowa’s Nutrient Reduction Strategy. This strategy, developed by the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and Iowa State University as a part of a 12-state task force, provides recommendations to farmers on how to reduce nitrogen loads.
Though the strategy does not mandate any conservation practices, Democrats said the increased funding would allow more best practices to be implemented, highlighting “wetlands, buffer strips, bioreactors and cover crops” as areas for increased funding.
Two tax incentive programs were also proposed. One was a state income tax credit for farmers, refundable for up to 50% of out-of-pocket expenses for implementing best management practices for water quality and reduced runoff, and the other , the Iowa Clean Water Certification program, would provide a $5 per acre property tax credit for farms that voluntarily follow an approved nutrient management plan and adopt practices from the Nutrient Reduction Strategy.
The proposal would also create a loan program, offering zero-interest loans for agricultural equipment linked with improved water quality.
While Democrats did not have estimates for the costs of implementing these five measures, Rep. Austin Baeth, D-Des Moines, an internal medicine physician, said the proposal was a “small amount of money” to address a problem which, left unaddressed, will cost the state greatly in the future through ongoing health concerns.
“When you look about the economic viability of this state down the road, we’re going to need to have clean water, and we’re going to need to have lower cancer rates,” Baeth said. “This is not only playing economic offense, it’s playing economic defense — because if we lose our workforce, our economy is going to be in rougher shape. So it is in everyone’s best interest here in the state of Iowa, it’s in every single Iowans’ interest that we drink healthy water. And so it makes sense that we all invest in fixing this problem together.”
Some Democrats and advocates have linked Iowa’s high cancer rates to water pollution.
Grassley cites state investment in water quality
While some Republicans have said water quality is an issue in Iowa, House Speaker Pat Grassley said it is important to note the DNR is already monitoring water quality and Iowa’s drinking water is approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
“As a state, we’re investing as much, if not more, than any other state in the nation, in water quality,” Grassley told reporters Thursday. “… We have to do a better job — not only those of us in agriculture, but in the Legislature, that have led on these issues — of telling the actual story of what we’ve done.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s top school board on Thursday proposed removing a requirement that new teachers pass a written version of the U.S. Naturalization Test to become fully certified, potentially undoing another of former state Superintendent Ryan Walters’ policies.
The Oklahoma State Board of Education and the state Legislature implemented the requirement last year, but since then, Walters has resigned from office and the board has had a complete turnover of its members.
State Superintendent Lindel Fields, who succeeded Walters, and the board voted unanimously to submit a bundle of new administrative rules, including the proposal to strike the testing requirement, to the Legislature for consideration in its 2026 session.
The Oklahoma State Department of Education received four written public comments that favored eliminating the testing rule, said Kory Kile, an agency attorney overseeing the rulemaking process.
Broken Arrow Public Schools communications chief Tara Thompson, who also acts as a spokesperson for Fields’ administration, said districts have complained the test adds an extra hurdle to teacher recruitment.
“It’s just one more barrier,” Thompson said after the state board meeting Thursday. “So, anything that the state Board of Education can do to remove barriers to onboarding and recruiting good teachers, I think we saw today that they’re willing to do that and have those conversations.”

Fields’ other proposed rules would encode laws the Legislature already passed or would make small changes to administrative processes.
Walters, on the other hand, sought to make sweeping policy changes through administrative rulemaking. His failed proposal to collect public school students’ immigration status put him at odds with Gov. Kevin Stitt, who overhauled the state Board of Education with new appointees in response.
Lawmakers rejected Walters’ immigration policy, but they partially approved his rule introducing the U.S. Naturalization Test to teacher certification. Rather than requiring the American civics test for all public school teachers, the Legislature agreed to mandate it only for educators earning their certification for the first time.
Fields already has reversed several of his predecessor’s priority policies. He pledged to rewrite Walters’ controversial academic standards for social studies and rescinded an order that public schools keep a Bible in every classroom.
Removing the naturalization test from the certification process is “a move in the right direction,” Thompson said.

(Photo by Zach Spindler-Krage)A proposal to repeal a ban on mining in northeastern Minnesota’s Superior National Forest is headed to the U.S. Senate following approval in the House, reigniting a long-simmering fight between environmentalists and pro-mining interests.
The reaction of outdoors and environmental groups was swift Wednesday.
“Congress just tossed aside years of scientific study and local input about how to conserve the headwaters of this wilderness for future generations, allowing the threat of toxic mining to return,” Jordan Schreiber, director of government relations at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement. He called on the Senate to “reject this attack and the precedent it sets to arbitrarily strike down” public land protections.
House Republicans voted Wednesday to undo former President Joe Biden’s 20-year moratorium on the extraction of copper, nickel and other minerals across more than 225,000 acres near the popular Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. If approved by the Republican-controlled Senate, the resolution would next go to President Donald Trump, who has indicated he would sign it into law. 
The resolution requires only a simple majority vote to pass the Senate, rather than a filibuster-proof majority.
Republican Congressman Pete Stauber, whose Duluth-based district covers the area, introduced the resolution last year. It uses an obscure but increasingly popular procedural tool that allows Congress to void certain Executive Branch actions.
In a statement Wednesday, Stauber hailed the resolution’s passage as a win for the regional economy, national security and congressional prerogatives. The resolution would prevent future administrations from imposing similar bans in the future.
“Reversing Biden’s mining ban will protect Northern Minnesota jobs, strengthen national security through domestic production, and prevent future overreaches from happening again,” Stauber said.
Organized labor cheered the move, too, albeit in terms more palatable to the Democratic base.
“One of the most important contributions Minnesota can make to the fight against climate change is leading the world in setting the highest bar for labor and environmental protections in the responsible production of copper, nickel and other critical minerals,” Joel Smith, president and business manager of LIUNA Minnesota and North Dakota, said in a statement, also mentioning the promise of “family-supporting careers” for union members and “community-supporting jobs at schools, hospitals, public and private sector employers.”
Environmental and outdoor recreation groups have long opposed mining near the Boundary Waters, a remote section of Superior National Forest along the border with Canada. The groups say it would disturb critical habitats and pollute a pristine watershed enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. 
In a statement describing the resolution as an unprecedented use of congressional power over public land use, Save the Boundary Waters urged voters to contact their senators and push for a “no” vote on the resolution. Save the Boundary Waters is pushing for a permanent ban on copper-ore sulfide mining in the boundary watershed. Citing peer-reviewed scientific research, the group says mining for copper and other heavy metals inevitably leaches sulfuric acid, toxic metals and other pollutants into surrounding water systems, harming the natural environment and imperiling tourism.
Northeast Minnesota sits atop the Duluth Complex, one of the world’s richest deposits of copper and nickel. Twin Metals, a subsidiary of the Chilean mining conglomerate Antofagasta, wants to extract both minerals — along with cobalt and other precious metals — from underground veins near Ely and Babbitt, about a dozen miles from the wilderness area.
It would be the first copper-nickel mine in Minnesota, which produces most of the United States’ domestic iron but few other metals. Regional and state officials have sought for years to reduce northeastern Minnesota’s economic dependence on volatile global markets for iron and steel. Its rich deposits of higher-value metals, along with elusive gases like helium and possibly hydrogen, could offer a lifeline.
The Twin Metals project has been in development for more than 15 years amid an arduous state and federal permitting process. It suffered a severe setback in early 2023 when the Biden administration announced a 20-year moratorium on mining across 350 square miles of the Superior National Forest, though Minnesota has issued new mineral exploration permits in the years since.  
Copper, nickel, cobalt and some precious metals are key inputs for a bevy of medical, automotive and industrial products. They’re also needed to produce wind turbines, solar panels, rechargeable batteries and other electrical technologies that scientists say are crucial for mitigating local air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Environmentalists say the the demand can be met with more robust recycling. 
Mining companies and their allies say it’s better for everyone’s sake to extract them in the United States rather than countries with lax environmental and human health protections, such as China or the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Removing the 20-year moratorium allows “proposed developments to proceed through the world’s strictest state and federal regulatory and permitting processes,” Stauber said on Wednesday.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image001-1024x766.png,,,2026-01-22 14:56:24.458147

The bill targets decisions by school districts to “opt out” of property tax limitations imposed by the state, in order to raise more revenue. Local residents can already petition a board’s opt-out decision to a public vote, but there is no requirement for an election if nobody organizes a petition drive.
Under the bill, a school board could approve an opt-out with a two-thirds vote, but the decision would then go to a mandatory election. The bill also requires boards to spell out not only the number of years an opt-out would run, but the “total maximum dollar amount of taxes payable over the full term.”

Sen. Sue Peterson, R-Sioux Falls, introduced the bill. She said the change is aimed at property tax relief and accountability, telling a legislative committee that current petition signature requirements can be difficult to achieve in larger districts and that voters should have a direct say when districts seek to exceed statutory property tax limits.
Opponents, including the Sioux Falls School District and the School Administrators of South Dakota, said the measure would weaken local decision-making by elected school boards, add election costs and single out schools compared to other local governmental entities. They pointed to current law that allows referendums by petition and noted that opt-outs that reach the ballot usually pass.
“At the end of the day, there is no other group that is required to have an election” for an opt-out, said Heath Larson with the Associated School Boards of South Dakota.
Separately, the committee advanced a bill 7-0 that would expand eligibility for South Dakota’s Partners in Education scholarship program by raising the income limit for families entering the program from 150% to 200% of the standard used to qualify for free or reduced-price school lunch. It would also allow students to remain eligible in later years if their household income stays under 250% of the standard.
Since 2016, the program has provided private-school scholarships, supported by insurance company donations in exchange for state tax credits.  Last year, lawmakers increased the program’s annual tax-credit cap from $3.5 million to $5 million.

(Courtesy of Colorado Parks and Wildlife)An Iowa House subcommittee advanced a bill Thursday that would initiate a state committee to study the feasibility of adding wildlife crossings on certain highways. 
House Study Bill 562 calls for an analysis of animal-vehicle collisions along highways, a ranking of high-crash corridors and suggestions for animal crossing solutions, which could include wildlife overpasses, underpasses or improved fencing along a highway corridor.
Wildlife overpasses are popular in some European countries and have been adopted in a handful of U.S. states. 
At the end of 2025, Colorado completed a wildlife overpass across a stretch of Interstate 25 between Denver and Colorado Springs. According to the state transportation department, the $15 million project was completed within a year and it, combined with wildlife underpasses and other crossing systems, is expected to reduce animal collisions along the stretch of interstate by 90%. 
Several environmental and wildlife conservation groups, including the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, Humane World for Animals and Animal Rescue League Iowa, registered in support of the bill. 
Humane World for Animals’ Iowa State Director Preston Moore said in an emailed statement that as human development continues to expand, wildlife are left with fewer “wild and open spaces.” 
“Developing safe wildlife road crossings as well as restoring and conserving critical habitat and wildlife corridors are essential to ensure wildlife are protected from increased human development and climate change,” Moore said. “Road development and vehicle collisions with wildlife can be quite damaging to populations, especially those that are already small and fragile.” 
According to a 2024 population density survey conducted by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, deer cause at least $129 million in vehicle collision costs in Iowa annually.
Moore said while deer account for the vast majority of animal-vehicle collisions, “many other species are struck on roadways.” 
The bill also calls for the development of a grant request strategy aligned with the federal department of transportation’s wildlife crossing program. 
State natural resources and transportation department directors would be asked to serve on the study committee. Rep. Norlin Mommsen, R-DeWitt, chaired the House subcommittee and asked if lower-level staff from the departments should instead sit on the committee. 
“We’re pulling in all the directors for – I’m not trying to minimize – but is this the best use of state resources?” Mommsen asked. 
Subcommittee members asked for additional information about animal-vehicle collisions in the state and on the success of wildlife overpasses. Mommsen advanced the bill, but said he would speak with additional stakeholders about it.

(Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Imagine there’s a lobbyist dedicated to helping New Mexicans get better access to cancer care, except this lobbyist also works for an oil and gas company whose drill sites are exposing people to carcinogens.
Imagine there’s a lobbyist for a ski resort that is running out of snow, and even running out of water used to make artificial snow, and yet this ski resort’s own lobbyist also works for an oil and gas trade association whose products are making global warming worse, and ski seasons shorter.
And imagine a university where heroic researchers are documenting the impacts of fossil fuels, chemicals and microplastics on human health…except the university’s lobbying firm also works for the mother of all climate denialists, ExxonMobil.
These three examples may sound like a parody of the obscene power that fossil fuel lobbyists enjoy in New Mexico. Something like WildEarth Guardians’ Exxtreme Energy campaign, which last October mocked climate denialism by almost holding (they were kicked out before they could) a wine-style tasting of pretend produced water at the Albuquerque Balloon Festival. 
But these are real examples of New Mexico lobbyists who are effectively playing both sides of the climate crisis. They get paid to further the state’s dependence on fossil fuels, and they also get paid to help people and businesses cope with the impacts of the crisis. 
Example number one is the firm Alarid Consulting, whose clients include Chevron and The US Oncology Network. Number two is lobbyist Lawrence Horan, whose clients include the New Mexico Oil & Gas Association and Taos Ski Valley, which is owned by billionaire conservationist Louis Bacon. 
And number three is a doozy. In 2024, researchers at the University of New Mexico found trace amounts of plastics in 100% of the human placentas they studied. The vast majority of plastics, a product of the petrochemical industry, end up in landfills where, the UNM researchers explained, they degrade and re-enter the environment and can enter our food. Previous studies of microplastics’ effects on human health have found connections between the pollutant and cardiovascular disease, cancer, metabolic disorders, and fertility complications. 
And yet UNM uses the Weaks Law Firm as one of its lobbying arms — as does ExxonMobil, one of the largest producers of the chemicals used to make single-use plastics. In September 2024, California sued ExxonMobil for decades of lying to the public about the recyclability of plastics. The company also produces more than 270,000 barrels of crude oil per day in New Mexico.
What is the Weaks Firm lobbying on for ExxonMobil? Their disclosure for 2025 is the vague and meaningless, “All matters of interest to the employer.” For Alarid Consulting and their work for Chevron, there isn’t even this much, just a blank space where the disclosure should be. 
How much are these climate double-agents paid by their fossil fuel clients versus their other clients? Wouldn’t it be nice to know. New Mexico has one of the weakest lobbyist disclosure systems in the country, according to a 50-state report card from F Minus. Lobbyists do not have to disclose compensation received from their clients, or the numbers of bills lobbied upon or positions taken on these bills. 
Like their lobbyists, oil and gas companies are given ludicrous leeway to self-report and police themselves when it comes to compliance with state regulations. In February 2023, satellite images showed a major methane leak from one of ExxonMobil’s Eddy County facilities. The company did not admit to this leak until confronted with these images. This demonstrates why New Mexico needs stronger independent monitoring of its oil and gas companies, as well as stronger monitoring of their lobbyists.
Last year, a bill sponsored by Sen. Jeff Steinborn and Rep. Sara Silva would have strengthened the state’s lobbyist law to require disclosure of bills lobbied upon and positions taken on these bills. But this reform bill was vetoed by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, with the disingenuous excuse that elected officials “with a donor base” should also be required to disclose when they change their position on an issue. The governor should change her own position here and demonstrate some independence from her donor base of oil and gas lobbyists by supporting Rep. Silva’s new lobbying reform bill, HB 35. With the climate crisis becoming more severe every year, the activities of fossil fuel lobbyists should not be left to the imagination.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1032-e1759359429280-1024x721.jpg,,,2026-01-22 14:37:27.883449

The state similarly reported no wiretaps in 2024 or 2023. 
The U.S. federal court system has not yet published its list of approved wiretaps for 2025. Its 2024 report doesn’t include any in Alaska; one wiretap, approved by former federal Judge Joshua Kindred, was approved for 30 days in 2023 for a narcotics case.
Under Alaska law, a wiretap occurs only when no one on a phone call is aware that it is being recorded. If one side of a conversation is aware of a recording, it is not legally a wiretap.
The state has been legally required since the 1990s to disclose the number of wiretaps approved by state judges, but the Alaska Department of Law failed for decades to publish a statutorily required wiretap report. It began reporting in 2018 after reporting by the Juneau Empire.
Neither the state of Alaska nor the U.S. Court System publish reports listing the number of times they intercept internet traffic. 
Those intercepts are believed to be more common. Last year, an investigation by the Anchorage Police Department led to the arrest of a former state medical board member for possessing images of children being sexually abused. That person later died in a house fire.

A new entry in the court’s docket shows that the start of their trial is now set for Feb. 23 at 8:30 a.m. before Ingham Circuit Judge Morgan Cole at the Veterans Memorial Courthouse in downtown Lansing.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and her department have alleged that the couple funneled money from their political nonprofit accounts to fund a lavish lifestyle, and will stand trial for embezzlement and other charges related to their activities.
The pair was bound over to the circuit court last May.

The Department of Attorney General’s case against the Chatfields asserts that, beginning in 2021, the couple allegedly used nonprofit money to reimburse themselves for purchases at luxe stores like Coach, items at amusement parks like Universal Studios, while Lee Chatfield also spent lavishly at strip clubs and partied with his associates and brothers.
An investigation into Chatfield began after his former sister-in-law reported to Lansing police an allegation that he had sexually assaulted her for years, starting when she was 14 or 15 years old. 
Michigan State Police probed the allegations and found evidence of potential financial improprieties – an investigation that was later taken over by Nessel. However, she said her office did not find sufficient evidence to pursue charges for criminal sexual conduct.
Two of Lee Chatfield’s aides, Robert and Anné Minard, recently pleaded guilty to lesser charges and agreed to testify against the Chatfields. The Minards were initially charged with conducting a criminal enterprise for their role in allegedly misappropriating funds from three non-profit organizations and two political action committees tied to Lee Chatfield.
Robert Minard served as Chatfield’s chief of staff and Anne Minard was his external affairs director.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)An organization representing owners of manufactured home communities is suing to block Washington’s landmark law capping rent increases.
Much of the conversation around House Bill 1217 in the last legislative session was about its limits on residential rent increases. But the law, which took effect in May, also blocks annual rent hikes of more than 5% for manufactured homes when residents own their home but have to lease the land they live on. No rent increases are allowed in the first year of a tenancy.
Manufactured Housing Communities of Washington argues in the lawsuit filed Tuesday that its members have felt “significant cost increases and lost revenue” because they can’t raise rents on their tenants more than 5%. 
Advocates argued the limit was necessary to give residents predictability so they’re not suddenly displaced by drastic rent hikes they can’t afford. But opponents said it would drive away developers and leave landlords unable to keep up with rising maintenance costs. 
The eight-page lawsuit, filed in Spokane County Superior Court, raises several issues with the law. It alleges violations of the state and U.S. constitutions because it doesn’t allow manufactured home park owners to seek an exception to the cap in case of emergency.
“This law isn’t just bad policy, it’s unconstitutional, unworkable, and actively undermining the long-term stability of manufactured housing communities across Washington,” the organization said in a statement. “It offers no safety valve, no hardship exemption, and no due process for property owners facing rising costs, emergencies, or infrastructure failures.”
The park owners also say it violates the contract clause in the U.S. Constitution because its passage nullified existing leases that allowed for rent increases. The lawsuit notes the state has issued cease and desist orders and threatened legal action against Spokane County park operators who enacted rent hikes in line with previous lease agreements. 
The attorney general’s office over the summer fined eight landlords $2,000 each for violating the law. The police allows the attorney general to recover up to $7,500 per violation.
Public housing authorities and some nonprofits are exempt from the cap. The organization argues this creates an unconstitutional two-tier system. 
The statewide organization is asking a judge to stop enforcement of the law. No court dates have been set.
Mike Faulk, a spokesperson for Attorney General Nick Brown said in an email Wednesday that, “We look forward to defending Washington law and are confident that this law will be upheld.”

Even if spring brings a lot of snow, Colorado River water managers will likely rely on the Wyoming-Utah reservoir to help maintain Lake Powell, state water officials say.
The post ‘Snow drought’ may result in extra release from Flaming Gorge appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s top water managers are warning that a significant drawdown of Flaming Gorge Reservoir this spring is likely imminent due to low snowpack and generally dry conditions throughout the seven-state Colorado River Basin region.
Wyoming is a headwaters of the Colorado River system, mostly via the Green River, which feeds Flaming Gorge.
As of Jan. 8, snow cover across the West was at its lowest since 2001, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Rain instead of snow throughout much of the region so far this winter portends a scant end-of-winter “water bank” vital to the river system when snow begins to melt in the spring, the agency noted. NOAA’s Jan. 14 update for the region indicated, “Snow drought has expanded and/or intensified across the Sierra Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and southwest Colorado.”
“The ground is pretty dry out there and so we’re not incredibly optimistic about what the runoff is going to look like, even if we do have good snowpack” in the coming months, said Senior Assistant Attorney General Chris Brown, who serves as counsel to the Wyoming State Engineer’s Office.

Flaming Gorge, which straddles the Wyoming-Utah border, is one of the key reservoirs in the Colorado River system that water managers turn to for extra releases when there’s a projected shortage — primarily to ensure operational water levels at Lake Powell. It’s a function of the Drought Response Operations Agreement among the basin states, multiple tribes and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The DROA and other binding agreements among Colorado River stakeholders have been the subject of a years-long negotiation with a fast-approaching deadline to renew.
For now, water managers are still tied to the current drought response plan, which regards Flaming Gorge as among “low-hanging fruit” to help meet downstream needs during exceptionally dry conditions, Brown explained Friday at a meeting of the Wyoming Colorado River Advisory Committee. Because of the widespread extent of “snow drought” so far this season, Brown said, Flaming Gorge stands as a primary spigot among several other backup reservoirs to supplement Lake Powell, which straddles the Arizona-Utah border.
“So if we do need to do a DROA release this year, likely most of it — if not all of it — will come from Flaming Gorge,” Brown said. “By April, we will have a much better handle on what the water supply conditions are for the year. Then, if we do have a release, it will [begin] in May.”
The Bureau of Reclamation began cutting back on releases from Lake Powell in December, anticipating poor spring inflows, an agency spokesperson told WyoFile. Water managers could also tap other backup reservoirs — Blue Mesa in Colorado and Navajo in New Mexico — to help supplement Lake Powell, according to the Wyoming State Engineer’s Office. But for now, Flaming Gorge remains the primary target.
Though it’s too early to know how much extra water might be released from Flaming Gorge, Brown reminded the committee of a 2022 order that called for an extra 500,000 acre-feet to help ensure that water levels downstream at Lake Powell didn’t drop low enough to threaten hydroelectric power generation at Glen Canyon Dam. An estimated 463,000 acre-feet of extra water was released before officials suspended the order, diminishing the reservoir to an estimated 72% of capacity.
“It’s a very difficult situation for winter grazing. This is having a very serious effect. If you think of where the water comes from, for the livestock out there, it’s from snow. There’s no snow out there.”John Hay III, Rock Springs Grazing Association
“The conditions this year are very similar to the conditions we experienced in 2022,” State Engineer Brandon Gebhart told WyoFile.
Some 40 million people throughout the southwestern United States and Mexico rely on the Colorado River Basin system. As a headwaters state, Wyoming is enmeshed in a 1922 compact that acknowledges a shared reliance on the river system and ever-changing legal obligations on how to divvy up its benefits and shortfalls.
The “aridification” of the West, driven by human-caused climate change, has complicated and intensified an often fraught relationship among Colorado River stakeholders — including some who say expectations placed on the system long ago were overly ambitious and, in light of climate change, nearly impossible to meet in the near future.
To underscore the severity of the situation, Brown noted to a legislative panel recently that, when the 1922 compact was signed, it centered on an assumed average annual flow of 18 million acre-feet through Lees Ferry in Arizona — essentially the river system’s key pulse. Over the past eight years, the average natural flow at Lees Ferry has been 11.4 million acre-feet.
“And so just the magnitude of that reduction in the hydrology has, I think, convinced everybody that it’s all-hands-on-deck.”
For now, agricultural producers in southwest Wyoming are closely watching the Colorado River negotiations, while dealing with an exceptionally dry winter. Exacerbated by a dry summer, ranchers are scrambling for supplemental feed, and some are hauling water for livestock, according to Rock Springs Grazing Association President John Hay III.

“It’s a very difficult situation for winter grazing,” Hay told WyoFile. “This is having a very serious effect. If you think of where the water comes from, for the livestock out there, it’s from snow. There’s no snow out there.
“I think you’re looking at a more serious situation this year than you have in the past,” Hay continued, adding that extra releases from Flaming Gorge are fairly common. He wouldn’t hazard a guess about how much extra water might be released this year, however. “This is going to be a very serious situation coming up if Mother Nature doesn’t get over her anger, or whatever.”
What it means for Wyoming
Though Flaming Gorge Reservoir’s primary purpose, since the dam’s construction in 1962, is to serve as an insurance-policy spigot of sorts, the massive body of water has become integral to the economy and culture of southwest Wyoming. It draws tens of thousands of visitors each year — some for the boating, camping and views of red sandstone desert features towering over the water, and others for the kokanee salmon and trophy-sized lake trout.

The Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area is a hotspot for wildlife and birdwatching. The annual Burbot Bash icefishing event — which encourages anglers to “Catch the Ugliest Fish in the West” — is another revenue-injecting draw to the region.
This year’s bash was cancelled, however, “due to safety concerns related to poor ice and projected winds,” the Wyoming Game and Fish Department said in a statement earlier this month. Perhaps another indicator of an often fickle and, according to the scientific community, larger climate trend for Wyoming and the Colorado River region, such realities underscore an already intense and difficult negotiation to reset plans for how to manage water in the future.
At stake are agricultural and economic matters far from Flaming Gorge.
Wyoming at the negotiating table
Beyond fishing for burbot, climate trends and a bad start to the snow season, Wyoming water officials are steeped in last-minute negotiations to settle on a “basin states alternative” to submit to the federal government.
It’s an effort that began years ago, spurred by an understanding that legal protocols for dealing with shortages in the Colorado River system will expire at the end of this year. For its part, Wyoming is an upper-Colorado River Basin state, along with Colorado, Utah and New Mexico. The downstream, lower-basin contingent includes California, Arizona, Nevada and a portion of New Mexico.
The Bureau of Reclamation is the primary federal authority involved and on Friday, it published its draft environmental impact statement regarding “Post-2026 Operational Guidelines and Strategies for Lake Powell and Lake Mead.” The statement outlines how to maintain Lake Powell, which is integral to the viability of Lake Mead (spanning Nevada and Arizona), the two largest water-storage systems in the Colorado River Basin.

The two reservoirs increasingly flirt with inoperative water levels in the face of climate change.
All along, basin states and other direct interests have preferred a stakeholders’ agreement over a federal mandate, according to Brown and Gebhart.
While a difficult task to deliver, Brown and Gebhart assured members of Wyoming’s Colorado River advisory group that they’re confident a basin states agreement will come to fruition.
“Wyoming’s focus and push has always been, and continues to be, trying to figure out a way to work with our partner states to figure out a solution that doesn’t put us into conflict,” Brown said.
The Bureau of Reclamation’s draft plan lays out several alternatives for managing Colorado River Basin reservoirs, but the agency didn’t choose a preferred option, leaving room for states to settle on a plan. Federal officials, however, are prepared to move forward with their own plan if the states do not come to an agreement.
“The river and the 40 million people who depend on it cannot wait. In the face of an ongoing severe drought, inaction is not an option,” Department of Interior Assistant Secretary for Water and Science Andrea Travnicek said in a prepared statement.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The state’s two K-12 education bodies are asking lawmakers for only slight increases in their budgets for the coming fiscal year.
The Mississippi Department of Education is asking for a $33 million, or 1% increase, to its $3.31-billion budget. Many of the agency’s spending priorities are directed to classrooms, not administration, and aimed at continuing improvement in education, State Superintendent Lance Evans told legislators.
“We won’t be satisfied until we lead the nation,” he said during a Senate Appropriations Committee meeting on Jan. 14.
A new adolescent literacy initiative would build on a 2013 literacy act — which established a third-grade reading gate and helped Mississippi gain national attention for improvement. Expanding the program to higher grades would cost $9 million. That money would add assistant directors, regional coaches and literacy coaches to support teachers and comprehensive statewide professional development. A similar math initiative would cost $3.48 million, the agency said, which would fund coaches’ salaries and travel, screeners and statewide training.
The agency wants to continue its new virtual teaching program, which would cost $2.1 million. The program, called the Mississippi REACH Remote Synchronous Teaching Initiative, is one of the agency’s attempts to respond to the teacher shortage affecting swaths of Mississippi schools. It puts educators, based in rooms at Mississippi Public Broadcasting, on classroom screens throughout the state. 
The education agency is also addressing teacher shortages by investing in its workforce. Officials want to spend $3.5 million on the Mississippi Teacher Residency Program and more than $500,000 on training for school leaders and superintendents. 
Another classroom initiative is $3.6 million that would be directed to expanding the state’s early childhood programs. 
The money would fund 33 early learning coaches to serve 40 collaboratives — a state and taxpayer funded pre-K program established by the Legislature in 2013 that created education partnerships in communities across Mississippi. It would also serve 33 state-invested pre-K programs — a similar program with less red tape that doesn’t require collaboration with Head Start centers — throughout the state, about 494 classrooms in total. 
Other funding initiatives include college-and-career readiness programs, equipment for driver education, the administration of state and federal tests, and support for the office of accreditation to better monitor compliance. 
The state’s student funding formula accounts for $2.974 billion of the agency’s total request for next year, compared to its $2.965-billion formula appropriation this year. The $9-million decrease is due to lower enrollment and fewer students who qualify for free and reduced-price lunch, agency officials said during their meeting with the Senate Appropriations Committee last week.
MDE also wants to pay for more school attendance officers, or truancy officers. The department is requesting additional funds to add capacity for SAOs across the state, as well as to fund more early childhood education employees.
The charter authorizer board, tasked with approval and overseeing the state’s charter schools, has only marginally raised its request compared to what it was appropriated this year. For the coming year, the board is asking the Legislature for $1,403,231, or a $3,321 increase.
The increase is due to slightly higher salary costs, which officials said were due to employing people with higher degrees. 
Lisa Karmacharya, director of the board, told Mississippi Today that the agency’s priorities remain the same this year as they’ve been for years past: quality oversight, support and accountability for the state’s charter schools.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/15115805/3X0A7188.jpg,,,2026-01-22 14:37:27.883449

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)A bill seeking to further restrict non-U.S. citizens from voting in state and local elections advanced at the Utah Legislature Wednesday over concerns it could disenfranchise voters.
Citizenship is already required to vote nationally and in Utah, and the state has identified just a handful of cases where non-citizens successfully registered to vote. By contrast, more than 1.5 million people in Utah cast ballots in the 2024 presidential election. 
“It doesn’t matter if it was just a few or there was a whole bunch,” bill sponsor Rep. Cory Maloy, R-Lehi, told members of the House Government Operations Committee. “That still eliminates trust.” 
Utah Director of Elections Ryan Cowley said his office has identified five people who successfully registered to vote despite not being citizens. Some voted at least once, he told the panel. He did not give a time frame for the cases.
The committee approved HB209 in a party-line vote of 9-3, with Democrats voting no.

“I just want to remind people, if somebody is aspiring to be a citizen, why would they vote in an election knowing that if they vote and they’re not allowed to, that’s probably going to ruin any prospect of becoming a citizen?” said House Minority Leader Angela Romero, D-Salt Lake City. 
To become a citizen, the U.S. government requires applicants to demonstrate they have good moral character. Criminal conduct can make them ineligible. 
It’s a misdemeanor crime in Utah for people to vote when they knew or should have known they’re not eligible for voter registration. A conviction carries up to a year in jail and a $2,500 fine.

Davis County Clerk Brian McKenzie told Utah News Dispatch the bill “does strengthen the integrity of our elections, not that there’s a significant problem.”
Asked to describe what kind of a change the bill would make for most Utahns, McKenzie replied, “zero impact.” 
He said the bill requires a vetting process that he and other county election officials already follow, using resources including a driver’s license database to verify who’s confirmed to be a U.S. citizen and who isn’t. 
Under existing law, a small number of people whose citizenship status isn’t clear are allowed to register to vote based on their affidavits swearing they’re citizens — unless election officials find evidence to the contrary, McKenzie said. Under the new proposal, they would have to provide proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate or naturalization documents. 
“Really, it is that very small percentage that we can’t verify through some other means,” McKenzie said. 
Opponents raised concerns the move could invite racial profiling and even remove U.S. citizens from voter rolls if they don’t have access to certain documents. Lisa Xochimitl of Saratoga Springs urged the panel to vote no, saying she’s faced prejudice based on her last name. 
“I’ve grown up in Provo, Utah, and have had issues with being discriminated against, and I get nervous about what that would look like,” Xochimitl said. 
Mormon Women for Ethical Government and the Utah League of Women Voters oppose the bill, noting early laws requiring proof of registration in Arizona and Kansas cost those states millions of dollars in administrative costs and lawsuit payouts.
Cambria Cantrell with the lieutenant governor’s office, which oversees elections in Utah, praised the bill for allowing multiple ways to verify citizenship. She said an experience Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson had in the past illuminated why that’s important. 
“A few years ago, the lieutenant governor, while in office, was removed from the voter rolls because someone looked at her registration,” Cantrell said. “She didn’t have naturalization information, but she was born in another country. She was born a citizen on the military base. We absolutely do not want that to happen.” 
The measure advances to the full House of Representatives. Outside of Utah, New Hampshire and Louisiana passed proof-of-citizenship bills in 2024, and Wyoming followed last year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Robert Raimondo hopes so. The North Kingstown Republican formalized his bid for the governor’s seat in a kickoff event at Brewed Awakenings Coffee House in Warwick Thursday morning. Aside from regular coffeehouse customers, the event drew two attendees, a Rhode Island Current photographer and a cameraperson for WPRI-TV 12.
Unlike former Gov. Gina Raimondo, who Robert said is a distant cousin, Robert Raimondo is a political newcomer. He’s never run for office before, and moved back to Rhode Island in October with the express purpose of fulfilling his lifelong dream to serve as state governor, he said in an interview Thursday.
The 58-year-old had not even registered to vote in the state at the time he filed his campaign paperwork in November, the Providence Journal reported. He has since registered. 
Inexperience and a slow start to the campaign did not dissuade Raimondo.
“At some point, if you want to do something you need to put your neck out there and try it,” Raimondo said. Of the turnout for his event, he added, “It is what it is.”
He’s hoping to gain attention through his policies, including a bold promise to eliminate state personal income taxes.
“Rhode Islanders are taxed enough,” Raimondo said in a press release. “Eliminating state income taxes will lower costs for families, help seniors on fixed incomes, and make our state a magnet for jobs and opportunity.”
Asked how he would offset the $2.1 billion in revenue from state income taxes — the largest source of income for the state each year — Raimondo explained that saving people money on taxes would spur more spending, generating income via state sales taxes. He also suggested businesses would be drawn to set up or expand in the state with a competitive income tax policy, further boosting state coffers.
Raimondo also backs the perennial Republican proposal for a state inspector general to reduce fraud and monitor state spending. 
He criticized Gov. Dan McKee’s administration for “so many things going wrong,” naming paycheck errors for state workers, the Washington Bridge and losing Hasbro as examples. 
“Every time you pick up the paper, it’s another thing,” Raimondo said. “It feels like everything is aligned, this is the point in my life, to try and change that.”
His policy ideas reprise the GOP playbook, but Raimondo does not consider himself a dyed-in-the-wool Republican. He voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, though he said he now supports Trump, naming his economic and health policies under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
A Providence native and certified public accountant, Raimondo moved to California in 1991 in search of work, according to his campaign website. His career took off away from home, with positions at top accounting firms and businesses in California and Hawaii. 
Since November, a month after moving back to his native state, he has served as founder of Leather and Lace, a holistic wellness studio development business, according to his LinkedIn page. The company is registered at the same Cranston address listed on Raimondo’s campaign finance account, but Raimondo said the corporate headquarters is preliminary. 
Raimondo is the third Republican to enter the 2026 gubernatorial race; Aaron Guckian, a former aide to Gov. Don Carcieri, kicked off his campaign in the same location on Dec. 1. Retired comedian Elaine Pelino unveiled a campaign website in July 2025, but has not held a formal kickoff event or promoted her campaign to the press. The state GOP has not endorsed a candidate in the race.
On the Democratic side, McKee is seeking a second full term, facing off against his 2022 rival, Helena Buonanno Foulkes and, potentially, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, who has not announced his decision yet. Gregory Stevens, who owns a trio of local Pat’s Italian Restaurants, also filed paperwork to run as a Democrat in the race.

(Photo by David Talukdar/Getty Images)Rep. Dave Jacoby, D-Coralville, called proposed legislation to have state universities adopt new due process policies “the worst written bill (he’s) ever seen” in his 22 years as a lawmaker Thursday during a subcommittee meeting.
House Study Bill 539 would have the Iowa Board of Regents create and implement a due process policy for state universities covering faculty, staff and students in which they are guaranteed “all the constitutional rights of due process.” The bill provides for “justified,” written exceptions “only accorded if necessary to achieve a significant institutional interest.”

Protections in due process and adjudication procedures universities would be required to establish under the bill include the presumption of innocence and rights to counsel, live hearings with questioning of witnesses and accusers,  knowledge of allegations and charges and more.
State universities must report to law enforcement any actions reported to them that constitute a felony, the bill stated, and the institutions would have to “implement a range of disciplinary sanctions” for those who “substantially” interfere with someone else’s due process rights.
Information on due process rights and protections would need to be posted prominently online and shared with all university students and employees.
A subcommittee made up of Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, Jacoby and Rep. Jeff Shipley, R-Fairfield, tabled the legislation until a future meeting.
Iowa Board of Regents Chief Operating Officer Carolann Jensen spoke to the subcommittee on behalf of the board, expressing concerns that this legislation would establish a new due process that “would be different than any other state employee process” and change other standards.
“I think it will make it difficult for the universities to take any disciplinary action against bad actors within the system,” Jensen said.
Other public commenters agreed with implementing better supports for those in dispute with their institutions. Iowa Association for Justice lobbyist Lisa Davis-Cook said during the subcommittee meeting the association has heard from members who said they have been “denied meaningful due process,” with current policies putting the whole burden of contesting allegations on the student.
However, she said the legislation should include mechanisms for enforcement to ensure university compliance if it becomes law.
Additional edits to the legislation were also offered by Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression Government Affairs Counsel Michael Hurley during his public comment, including adding language barring conflicts of interest, protecting “the right to active assistance of counsel,” clarifying the right to appeal and either narrowing or removing the exception included in the bill.
“We are broadly supportive of HSB 539 because it would markedly improve fairness in campus disciplinary proceedings, providing several vital protections that are often lacking,” Hurley said. “However, there are several gaps in the bill that may allow universities to skirt its requirements or work around it.”
With the number of changes Hurley suggested, Jacoby said he was confused by the support for the legislation. He said that when talking about due process, lawmakers must be “very explicit” in what their meaning and intent is, and added that this is a bill that could be “hurried too much” through the legislative process.
“I think it’d be simpler just to post the Fifth and 14th Amendments on the websites of each school,” Jacoby said.
Jacoby also asked whether international students would have the same “strength of support” for due process and if the bill would include private colleges that participate in the Iowa Tuition Grant program.
Neither Shipley nor Holt gave their thoughts on the legislation during the meeting.
“We will take these comments under advisement, and we’ll determine what we’re going to do as we move forward today,” Holt said.

Scott sat on the interim DOGE task force, named for the now defunct federal Department of Government Efficiency. 
“Last year, through DOGE, we started to look at some of these commissions and some of the bloat in government, and this is one that really caught our attention,” Scott told the House State Affairs Committee on Thursday. 
She said that Boise-area nonprofit groups, such as the Idaho Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the Idaho Hispanic Foundation, could pick up the work of the commission. 
The DOGE committee in December questioned the commission’s executive director Annette Tipton, likening the work it does to “DEI,” which stands for diversity, equity and inclusion, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.  
Tipton said that the commission was formed in the 1980s, when “DEI wasn’t even a thing.” She said the programs, such as the student leadership program, is open to all students and has shown a positive correlation with graduation rates and higher education enrollment rates.
The DOGE members voted to explore removing the state funding for commission in a phased approach, the Sun reported, with the idea that it would make it up through private fundraising. 
The governor’s proposed budget for the commission is $288,500 in state general funds, according to the state legislative budget book. 
There was very little discussion at Thursday’s House State Affairs Committee meeting. Committee members tied in a vote to introduce the bill, which would have allowed it to come back for a public hearing. Having failed to garner a majority support, the motion to introduce it failed and the legislation didn’t advance.

Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, told the body Thursday morning that the concrete plan would be communicated to members and the public by noon on Monday. 
“Weather is continuing to be an issue, as we all know this upcoming week. Safety is our greatest concern for everybody in this room and everybody that is in the galleries,” Gudger said.

Legislative leaders have posted  budget hearings that were scheduled for Monday to Thursday, Jan. 29 at 8:30 a.m. Those will last until about 11:30 a.m. and the Senate will convene around 12:15 p.m., he said.
Ashley Ravencraft, a lead forecaster for the Huntsville National Weather Service, said in an interview Thursday morning that there will likely still be ice on the road, sidewalks and trees Monday morning, but will clear up by Tuesday. Lauderdale, Colbert and Franklin counties were upgraded from a winter weather advisory to an ice storm warning from Saturday morning through Sunday. 
“If there’s any water that’s left on the roadways or any kind of driveways or sidewalks, it will likely freeze as our temperatures are going to be very, very cold Sunday night as we head into Monday,” Ravencraft said. “They likely won’t unfreeze until Tuesday. That’ll be something to watch, too.”
House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, said Thursday lawmakers would be in communication on Sunday afternoon. 
“The thing I don’t want to do is put our members in danger traveling on the roads. Talking to EMA this morning, their concerns are travel might not be very good for Tuesday,” Ledbetter said. “So we’ll wait until Sunday and try to get a better update on the weather.”
Ravencraft said there could be up to one-quarter inch of ice, which is heavy enough to break tree branches and cause power outages.
“If you’ve got a generator, make sure you’ve got gas for it. Make sure that you’ve got all your proper winter weather clothing, plenty of blankets and ways to stay warm and insulated, and food,” Ravencraft said.
Gudger said that if there is still ice on the road on Monday at noon, the Legislature will not come in on Tuesday. If the roads are clear, the Legislature will come in at 3 p.m. Tuesday. 
“I’m sorry that we don’t have a definite plan, but this is the best plan that we’ve got as we go forward, and we’re going to take it day by day,” Gudger said. “If we can come in on Tuesday to do the work of the people, we’re going to do that. If we can’t, because of safety, we’re not coming in.”
The rest of the northern counties, except for Cullman, are under a winter weather advisory, Ravencraft said. She said the weather models have shifted warmer in the last 48 hours, but that does not mean Alabamians should relax.
“It’s not quite time to let our guard down yet,” she said. “We still need to be prepped for the worst, but hoping for the best.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Garlan-Gudger-Jan-20-2026-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-22 13:37:47.639923

Mike Braun announced Thursday that Indiana will opt into a new initiative allowing Hoosiers to collect federal tax savings for investments made in K-12 scholarships.
The new federal tax credit was established under President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill and applies to charitable contributions made to scholarship-granting organizations that serve eligible K-12 students.

“Parents are in charge of their children’s education,” Braun said in a news release. “As a state, we are prioritizing that through universal school choice and a state tax credit for donations made to scholarship granting organizations, which helps make a high-quality education accessible and affordable for every Hoosier family.
“Under President Trump’s leadership, we welcome this increased focus on school choice at the federal level and are ready to leverage this additional, federal tax credit to expand opportunities for students and families across our state,” he continued.
Braun visited Saint Philip Neri Catholic School to mark the occasion, speaking with teachers and students.

Families can access scholarships through eligible scholarship-granting organizations to support qualified educational expenses, including costs incurred for children at public and private schools — such as tuition, fees, tutoring, educational therapies, transportation or technology.
Beginning Jan. 1, 2027, Hoosiers will be eligible for a nonrefundable federal tax credit of up to $1,700 for contributions to participating scholarship-granting organizations. Any unused credit may be carried forward for up to five years.

“Every child is unique, and Indiana is home to a variety of high-quality educational options to meet those needs, regardless of a family’s income or ZIP code,” said Indiana Education Secretary Katie Jenner.
“This new federal tax credit will continue to drive investments in scholarships, ensuring high-quality educational opportunities are within reach for every learner, in an environment that helps them reach their greatest potential,” she said.
The state of Indiana also offers a 50% tax credit for donors to qualified Indiana scholarship-granting organizations. There are no limits to the amount a donor can contribute to them.
Several GOP-led states have also opted in, according to Ballotpedia News. Students in states that do not opt in cannot receive scholarships funded under the program, but donors in those states can still receive a federal tax credit by donating to scholarship-granting organizations in participating states.
In order to qualify for a scholarship under the program, students must live in households earning no more than 300% of the area’s median gross income and be eligible to enroll in K-12 schools.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/55055355901_ed1ff34886_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-22 13:37:47.639923

It would make it a Class C misdemeanor, punishable by up to three months in jail.
Bolton said he introduced the bill to make people identify themselves so that law enforcement can be sure they know who they are dealing with when they are investigating a potential crime.

But the House Public Safety and Homeland Safety Committee also amended to remove a provision that would have made it a Class C misdemeanor to refuse to give a law enforcement officer “an explanation of his or her actions.” Bolton brought the amendment to the committee.
“I don’t really feel comfortable with that,” Bolton said, who spent 25 years as a police officer with the Northport Police Department. “I have asked that they amend that out.”
Bolton sponsored a similar version of the bill during the 2025 session, but it did not pass the Legislature.
Before they can compel someone to cooperate and provide information, the bill states that an officer must have a reasonable suspicion that a person is about to commit a felony, misdemeanor, or “other public offense.”
During the meeting, Rep. Thomas Jackson, D-Demopolis, asked Bolton to define the “reasonable suspicion.”
“That is when an officer sees something he, in his experience and training, suspects that someone is committing a criminal offense,” Bolton said.

Last week, state Rep. Matt Maddock (R-Milford) welcomed small farmers from across the state to offer their support for his House Bills 5217–5219, with multiple supporters arguing that the bills would allow consumers to make their own choices, while acknowledging any risks that come with consuming raw milk.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Academy of Pediatrics and experts at Harvard Medical and other institutions warn against consuming raw milk as it has not been pasteurized – a quick heating process which kills disease-causing germs. 
These bacteria can cause foodborne illness, with symptoms like diarrhea, stomach cramping, alongside more severe outcomes like paralysis, kidney failure, stroke and death.
While Michigan law blocks farmers from selling unpasteurized milk, residents can acquire raw milk through herd shares. Under these agreements, members either pay for an animal’s board or purchase a share of the animal, in exchange for milk from the cow.
Maddock’s bills would allow farmers to sell unpasteurized milk directly to customers, while establishing product and labeling standards and requiring a waiver for individuals purchasing the milk.
Committee members voted along party lines to send the bills to the Rules Committee, with Democrats voting in opposition. 
Rep. Mike McFall (D-Hazel Park), offered a substitute to House Bill 5218, requiring farmers to include a list of the most common bacteria found in raw milk on the label, alongside warnings that certain consumers – including children under 5, adults older than 65, pregnant women and adults with weakened immune systems – are at higher risk for illness if they consume raw milk. 
The committee rejected the amendment along party lines.
Rep. John Fitzgerald (D-Wyoming), the committee’s minority vice chair, also offered a substitute for House Bill 5219.

A union representing nurses at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital is threatening to strike after the 500-employee facility changed its contract offer upon projecting a $14.5 million annual budget shortfall for the current fiscal year.
The 135-member Brattleboro Federation of Nurses said the hospital had proposed wage increases totaling 11% over three years, only to reduce that figure during negotiations this week to no raises at all.
“They are asking the nurses basically to bail them out,” Tracy Ouellette, a nurse and union president, said upon announcing the impasse Thursday.
The union had paused contract talks last fall as the hospital — the main health care provider for about 55,000 people in southeastern Vermont — addressed state regulatory questions about its budget and the subsequent departures of its chief executive and financial officers.
The hospital’s new interim leaders, appearing Wednesday before the state’s Green Mountain Care Board, noted the need for contract mediation as they outlined their challenges. 
“We are at a point where hard financial decisions must be made,” Tony Blofson, one of two acting co-CEOs, said in a statement Thursday. “The truth is, we cannot continue operating at status quo — it’s simply not sustainable. Our shared goal is to ensure the long-term health of BMH, the jobs of all of us here, and to preserve the care our community depends on.”
The union didn’t announce a date for members to discuss and decide whether they will actually strike. Instead, both nurses and the hospital’s new leaders said they wanted to keep negotiating a three-year contract to replace one that expired Sept. 30.
“Nurses would not be considering a strike vote if we had other real options,” Ouellette said. “If experienced nurses can’t afford to stay, and new nurses won’t come, patient care suffers and the entire community pays the price.”
In its statement, the hospital noted “the critical role nurses play in delivering high-quality patient care” and “a willingness to reopen negotiations on specific economic issues … to reach an agreement that supports employees while ensuring long-term financial stability.”

Cecelie Williams, R-Dittmer, speaks in 2025 during Missouri House debate (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications)The text messages were brief, but state Rep. Cecelie Williams told the Missouri House on Thursday that they carried her backward in time.
She thought she had worked through the feelings of fear, self-doubt and the instinct to shrink and stay quiet. Last year, she publicly shared her history of domestic abuse for the first time, hoping it would give purpose to her pain.
But those feelings came rushing back, she said, when she looked at her phone during a September special legislative session and found messages from Democratic state Rep. Jeremy Dean.
“I live with PTSD from abuse I endured,” Williams said. “And this situation has intensified those triggers for me for more than four months.”
Williams’ speech preceded a 138-10 House vote to sanction Dean for sending her obscene and unwanted text messages, a decision that followed a bipartisan ethics investigation but stopped short of expulsion.
All 10 “no” votes came from Democratic lawmakers.
Williams voted in support of the punishment — which includes removal from committees, mandatory sexual harassment training and a requirement that Dean remain at least 50 feet away from her — but made clear she believed expulsion was warranted.
“We are held to a higher standard, one that should exceed any corporate or private workplace,” Williams said. “Because, let us be honest, at any other job, a message like that would be grounds for immediate termination, no questions asked. We cannot excuse behavior in the Capitol that would never be tolerated anywhere else.”
Democratic state Rep. Jeremy Dean, left, listens on Thursday as GOP Rep. Cecelie Williams discusses the obscene text message he sent her, which became the focus of an ethics complaint (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).
As Williams spoke, Dean sat silently at his desk. He voted “present” on the ethics report and left the chamber shortly after the vote. Dean has publicly apologized for the messages but told The Independent earlier this month that the ethics complaint was politically motivated.
On Sept. 4, while engaged in a sit-in protest on the House floor, Dean sent a text message to Williams, a Republican from Dittmer, while she was participating in a House Elections Committee hearing.
At the time, the committee was taking testimony on a proposal to change how majorities are counted for constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petition.
The message included a graphic reference to an oral sex act involving the president and questioned how Republicans could speak while engaged in it. According to the ethics report, Dean was watching a livestream of the hearing and sent a second message after seeing Williams’ reaction.
Williams said a second message arrived roughly 20 minutes after the first, following a colleague’s photo of her phone displaying the original text. That message, she said, read: “Make sure it isn’t blurry.”
Dean told investigators that he recognized the messages were “inappropriate and unprofessional” and said he regretted sending them. He denied any intent to disrupt the legislative process, intimidate Williams or improperly influence her participation in the hearing.
The House Ethics Committee — the only House committee with equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats and a minority-party vice chair — unanimously approved the sanctions.

After the messages became public, Williams said the scrutiny shifted quickly toward her rather than the sender. She was asked what she sent first, whether she provoked the exchange and why she told anyone at all.
“I have heard those questions before,” she told the chamber. “Just in another chapter of my life.”
Earlier in the year, during a freshman orientation, Williams said she spoke openly in a small group about surviving abuse and how it shaped her life. Dean was present, she said, and already knew her story — a fact that made the messages feel more calculated.
Williams rejected the notion that Dean apologized to her, describing an unsigned email she said amounted to little more than: “I’m sorry you were offended.”
“That is not an apology,” she said. “It is deflection.”
The most painful moment, she said, came when her 13-year-old daughter learned about the messages after seeing a newspaper while checking the mail.
“She cried,” Williams said. “Only knowing that something had hurt her mom.”
Williams said she felt embarrassed and ashamed, despite knowing she had done nothing wrong — a reaction she recognized as a coping mechanism shaped by earlier trauma. She began moving through the Capitol differently, she said, more guarded and more cautious.
“I wish this had never happened,” Williams told the House. “But I cannot undo the text that was sent.”
What she could do, she said, was refuse to remain silent.
“Silence may have been my survival once,” Williams said. “But today, my voice is my defense.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cecelie-Williams-022425-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-22 12:36:47.946632

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Bergen County cannot be sued over a rollerblader’s park pothole injury, New Jersey’s highest court ruled Thursday.
Protections from a 1968 law that shields private landowners from civil liability over injuries on their property to encourage them to allow recreational activities there extend to public parks and the governments that operate them, New Jersey’s Supreme Court ruled.
“What began as narrow immunity for hunting and fishing in forested lands has evolved into a broader immunity,” Justice John Jay Hoffman wrote for a unanimous court.
Rep. LaMonica McIver to appeal judge’s decision on her assault charges

The case turned on whether civil immunity granted to property owners by the Landowners Liability Act extended to Van Saun Park, a 130-acre park in Paramus, a Bergen County suburb of a little less than 27,000 people.
The law says landowners have no duty to keep their property safe for recreational activities and are not required to post warnings of any hazardous conditions there.
Andris Arias sued the county after falling into a pothole on a paved pathway in the park, charging that the county was negligent by failing to repair it or warn visitors of its presence. She said the fall caused permanent and severe neurological pain and required spinal surgery.
Her attorney and a spokesperson for the county did not return requests for comment.
The justices found the shield created by the Landowner Liability Act extends to the park despite past rulings that limited the law’s effect on suburban properties, though those rulings typically dealt with residential properties, like fenced back yards.
Exposing municipalities or counties to civil suits over park conditions could raise costs and taxes or spur governments to slim down open space offerings, the court said.
“To avoid such risks and costs, municipalities might close parks, avoid opening new ones, or begin charging admission to facilities such as Van Saun Park,” Hoffman wrote. “Such consequences are antithetical to the Legislature’s express purpose in enacting and subsequently broadening the LLA.”

(Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Roughly 200 of Nebraska’s National Guard members will be sent to Washington, D.C., to serve as security for the country’s 250th anniversary celebration, Gov. Jim Pillen announced Thursday.
Nebraska will join 10 other states Pillen said are “answering the call” after being asked by the chief of the National Guard Bureau to keep national monuments safe. He said the initiative has been ongoing since August. Nebraska is sending troops in late February.
“This [is] everybody’s Capitol,” said Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly, a former prosecutor. “Not Virginia’s, not Maryland’s, but a federal Capitol. Now Nebraska is delighted to do our bid to keep that place safe.”
Nebraska’s mission will last between 90 to 120 days, according to Maj. Gen. Craig Strong, Nebraska’s adjutant general. Working in groups of four, Strong said Nebraska’s troops will primarily serve as monument security and conduct safety patrols throughout the Capitol region.
Pillen said the mission would not cost Nebraska taxpayers “a nickel,” as the project is entirely federally funded.
Pillen said he hasn’t heard any indication that national monuments would be under threat during the festivities. However, he said, having a National Guard presence would be a deterrent for potential crimes.
“When there’s a presence, bad people stay away,” Pillen said.
Pillen has deployed National Guard members multiple times throughout his first term, including multiple trips to the southern border and in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa for emergency response following the 2024 tornadoes.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)An Arkansas resident has come forward with the winning $1.8 billion Powerball ticket that was sold in Cabot last month, claiming the largest jackpot in state history, lottery officials said Thursday.
The Arkansas Scholarship Lottery said in a news release that the winner chose to receive a lump-sum $834.9 million payment. The winner chose to remain anonymous, and the lottery did not say what city the person was from.
A 2021 Arkansas law allows lottery winners of more than $500,000 to remain anonymous for three years. The lottery was the second-largest jackpot in Powerball and U.S. lottery history.
“Everyone was anxiously waiting for the winner to step forward, but we are happy they took the time to seek legal counsel and financial advice first, as we recommended,” Arkansas Scholarship Lottery Executive Director Sharon Strong said in the release. “We are thrilled that the winner is from Arkansas!”
The ticket was bought from a Murphy USA gas station in Cabot. The station will receive a $50,000 commission for selling the winning ticket.
State taxes on the jackpot were withheld at 3.9% and federal taxes at 24%, the lottery said.
Supporters of Arkansas’ lottery jackpot anonymity law said the measure was needed to protect the safety of winners and to give them time to put their affairs in order. For elected officials and their immediate family who win, that anonymity under the law is limited to six months.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota House of Representatives on Thursday approved a bill to provide free school meals to K-12 students, sending the bill to the Senate. 
The Senate will take up the bill Friday, the last scheduled day of North Dakota’s special legislative session. The House, after a lengthy debate, passed House Bill 1624, 55-38. 
Bill sponsor Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, said the bill mirrors a constitutional ballot measure that would require the state to cover the cost of lunch and breakfast for all K-12 students.
He admitted that without the push for the constitutional amendment, the debate on the bill would not be taking place. He said putting free school meals into state law, instead of changing the constitution, gives the Legislature the flexibility it needs to tweak the law, if needed. 
Committee backs free meals for North Dakota students with narrow support

The Together for Free School Meals coalition is gathering signatures to put free school meals up to a statewide vote in November. 
Nathe said he expected the coalition to support the bill because it covers what it is in the measure, but provides the funding starting in the 2026-27 school year — a year earlier than the measure would. 
“So if they truly believe and support kids, as they’ve been telling me, …. they would support this bill,” Nathe said. 
The bill would provide $65 million to cover the cost of breakfast and lunch at public schools. Private and tribal schools would be able to opt in. 
The Legislature expanded the state’s free and reduced lunch program but lawmakers have held back on free school meals for all students. 
Among the opponents was Rep. Steve Vetter, R-Grand Forks, who opposed paying for school meals for families with six-figure incomes that can afford school meals. 
He referenced Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol,” saying he supports paying for meals for poor Tiny Tim but not for rich Uncle Scrooge. 
“It’s a bad idea to feed Scrooge,” he said. 
The bill received a narrow do-pass recommendation in committee Wednesday. The bill had less support from the Senate members of the committee, supporting it with an 8-7 vote.
During the 2025 legislative session, members of the Senate did not vote on either of the two House bills that would have provided free meals to K-12 students. Both bills were defeated in the House.
Senators voted unanimously to expand the state’s free and reduced school lunch program to include households earning less than 225% of the federal poverty level, which is about $72,000 for a family of four.
The Senate is scheduled to convene at 8:30 a.m. Friday.

Cummings Courthouse in downtown Baltimore. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)When people talk about the “death tax,” they mean the estate tax, a tax on the ultra-wealthy. But Maryland has another death tax — the Maryland inheritance tax, a tax on non-wealthy Marylanders who did not have children.
The Maryland inheritance tax is often conflated with the estate taxes, so people assume that this is a tax on the wealthy. In fact, it’s a tax that only burdens non-wealthy people. More precisely, wealthy people do pay the inheritance tax, but it counts as a credit against the Maryland estate tax, so the inheritance tax does not cost them anything. This bizarre result is due to history, not intentional policy. You can also avoid the tax if you have a second home in another state or a trust.
The Maryland inheritance tax is very subtle in how it discriminates. It is a 10% tax on inheritances. But most people don’t need to pay it because an inheritance left to a spouse, child, grandchild or sibling is exempt.
If we rephrase that slightly, it’s a tax on leaving an inheritance beyond your nuclear family and lineal descendants. For those that did not have children, they have no options to leave an inheritance to someone of a younger generation without being taxed. And for those that did not get married, they will likely be taxed when leaving an inheritance to their partner. In effect, it’s a punishment on those that did not form a “traditional nuclear family.”

It’s a tax on leaving an inheritance to nieces, nephews, cousins, friends and unmarried romantic partners, no matter how close the relationship is. The familial exemptions are not an objective assessment of which relationships are worthy of protection, they are only a list of who the legislature has decided to count as family. Maryland law prohibits discrimination based on marital and familial status in employment and housing, but not in death.
LGBTQ+ people are particularly vulnerable to the tax as they’re about half as likely to be married and substantially less likely to be parents. When they pass their assets to their loved ones, they are taxed while most others are not.
The Maryland inheritance tax was adopted before the Civil War. In 1848, Maryland’s highest court ruled that enslaved people freed through a will had to pay inheritance tax on their freedom.
In the 20th century, almost every state had an inheritance tax and every state had a state estate tax. Now, only five states still have an inheritance tax, and only 12 have an estate tax. Maryland is the only state left with both.
The tax is riddled with arbitrary distinctions. Leave an inheritance to a brother or half-brother – no tax. Leave an inheritance to a stepbrother or brother-in-law – it’s taxed. Name a beneficiary on a life insurance policy – no tax. Forget to do so – taxed. Cash in another state – no tax. A bank account in another state – taxed.
The inheritance tax only raises about $75 million per year statewide—enough to cover 0.15% of Maryland’s operating budget. Just to show how little this is, if we raised the sales tax from 6% to 6.08%, it would cover the cost of repealing the inheritance tax. Like increasing the sales tax by eight cents on the sale of a $100 pair of shoes.
The stumbling block to repealing the inheritance tax is that the registers of wills use the inheritance tax as their dedicated funding source. In 2000, the inheritance tax was repealed for descendants, spouses and siblings. To repeal it entirely, the proposal was to increase probate fees to fund the registers, which failed. In 2025, the governor’s office tried to repeal the inheritance tax. The proposal was to increase the Maryland estate tax to fund the registers, but it also failed.
I propose that the registers be funded like any other state agency — through the general fund. If you’re trying to advance justice, but you’re unwilling to pay for it or offend anyone, you’re trying to make an omelet without cracking an egg.
The inheritance tax is Maryland’s fiscal appendix. We feel the pain from the inflammation of injustice, but we are afraid to undergo the needed surgery. So, we treat its symptoms, creating one more exemption or one more rule, each time adding administrative burden and reducing fiscal relevance. It is time to cut out the appendix. It will hurt for the moment, but we will heal back stronger than before.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC09016-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-22 11:56:40.540923

But there's tremendous potential in the United Nations.”The board includes Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Mongolia, Morocco, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan, according to a list shared by the White House. The Trump administration earlier this month stopped processing visas for residents from several of those countries, writing in a social media post that those ""migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates."" Countries on the list include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Jordan, Mongolia, Morocco, Pakistan and Uzbekistan. Belgium declinesThe White House originally included Belgium on the list of Board of Peace members, but Deputy Prime Minister Maxime Prévot wrote in a social media post the country’s leaders have “NOT signed the Charter of the Board of Peace. This announcement is incorrect.”“We wish for a common and coordinated European response,” Prévot wrote. “As many European countries, we have reservations to the proposal.”Trump has been highly critical of European allies and repeatedly criticized NATO during his second term, especially as he’s ramped up pressure to acquire Greenland. Trump said during his speech, while members of the Board of Peace sat nearby in chairs, that he believes it “has the chance to be one of the most consequential bodies ever created.”“Together, we are in a position to have an incredible chance — I don't even call it a chance. I think it's going to happen — to end decades of suffering, stop generations of hatred and bloodshed, and forge a beautiful, everlasting and glorious peace for that region and for the whole region of the world because I'm calling the world a region,” Trump said. “The world is a region. We’re going to have peace in the world. And boy, would that be a great legacy for all of us. Everybody in this room is a star, or you wouldn’t be here.”",,,,2026-01-22 11:56:40.540923

Hertel said the bills will also aim to put parents more squarely in command of what their children are exposed to in a quickly advancing AI-heavy tech landscape.
“At the end of the day, every parent wants the same thing: to know their kids are safe, happy, and healthy. But in today’s increasing digital world, Big Tech’s exploitative practices are making that harder than ever,” said Hertel, who sponsored Senate Bill 758. “As both a parent and a legislator, I refuse to raise my children in a world where Big Tech profits at their expense and the expense of their classmates.”
Chang, who sponsored Senate Bill 759, said lawmakers have a duty to protect children from imminent danger in both physical and digital spaces.

“As social media and AI platforms continue to grow and advance, we must be proactive in regulating these exploitative and often dangerous online spaces that do not care about the well-being of its youngest users,” Chang said. 
Polehanki, a former high school teacher, sponsored Senate Bill 760, which focuses on AI chatbots.
“I know firsthand just how much our kids are online and how much unfettered digital activity inhibits their ability to learn, socialize with one another, and live a healthy, balanced lifestyle,” Polehanki said. “And as a legislator, I’ve also seen how unregulated AI companion chatbots have inflicted real-life harm to kids across the nation.”
The bills were referred to the Michigan Senate Finance, Insurance and Consumer Protection Committee.
Reporters asked the group if the onus was on big tech companies or parents, given that a large focus is on parental consent.
Polehanki said it was important for parents to step up their game, in terms of being aware of what their kids are consuming on social media and the internet.
“However, a Gen X parent, or even a millennial parent, has not been faced with anything like this before,” she said. “This is unprecedented, so I have a feeling a lot of parents just don’t know that. There are even AI chat bots out there that are seeking to have inappropriate relationships with their kids. … We don’t live in a world anymore where you can give a kid a phone and just let them go scroll for a couple of hours in a corner. It’s dangerous out there.”
Hertel said that he’s found, as a parent of a young child, that the few parental controls available haven’t kept up with the glut of data collected from kids’ devices.
“I think every parent, while we all have to have an active role in enforcing how our kids interact online, we can’t simply just take it away,” Hertel said. “We need the tools to be able to do that in a meaningful way.”
Even as more people become aware of the dangers of too much screen time and social media addiction, America’s health institutions have yet to classify it as a specific addiction disorder much like psychological dependencies on alcohol, drugs and nicotine. The senators were asked if it would be helpful to legislative causes, like the package introduced Wednesday, if social media addiction was classified as an official disorder.
Camilleri said the legislation doesn’t contemplate that move, but it was something both kids and adults are grappling with every day.
“We’ve added these new addictions across decades, things like gambling. They were never considered an addiction, but now it is, and perhaps this is something that is becoming one of those addictions that’s not just inflicting kids, it’s afflicting adults too,” Camilleri said. “So I think it’s worth looking at, but I don’t know that we’re at that point of calling it a legislative category that we should be addressing.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260121_095926-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-22 11:56:40.540923

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Democratic lawmakers touted three bills on Wednesday that they say will make it easier to build affordable housing in the state, a continuation of a multi-year campaign to spur development and allow more housing types across the state.
“Fundamentally, it’s about the landscape of Colorado being one that, over the next several years, leads to a more livable and affordable one,” Polis said of the legislation.
In past years, Polis has signed bills that tweak land use codes in Colorado’s largest cities, encourage development near bus stops and train stations, and incentivize construction of housing like condominiums, modular homes and accessory dwelling units. The state’s demography office estimates that Colorado has a housing shortfall of about 106,000 units.

Most of those laws directly affect cities along the Front Range, and the push for reforms has put Polis and lawmakers at odds with some cities, which want to maintain local control over their land and development policies.
“Even when we have had conflict with some of our local leaders around land use and the ways that we should pursue increasing housing inventory in this state, it’s the fact that we’ve all stayed at the table and continue to work on problem solving,” House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Dillon Democrat, said.
One of the bills up this year, House Bill 26-1001, is a new take on legislation from last year that would have allowed faith organizations like churches, universities and public schools to build housing more easily on unused land they own. This year’s version excludes churches but loops in nonprofits, housing authorities and transit districts.
“These groups know what works, and they, as subject matter experts, ought to be able to have that freedom and flexibility to address the housing crisis in a way that works best for them,” Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat sponsoring HB-1001, said. “They often have the land that is centrally located that they want to put to good use, but their hands are tied due to bureaucracy and red tape, and so that land sits vacant and unused while the housing costs continue to skyrocket.”
Under the bill, local governments would need to allow housing projects on such land under an administrative review process. They couldn’t reject a project based on height as long as it follows standards within the zoning district, and they couldn’t require stricter standards than similar projects. The bill was introduced last week on the first day of the legislative session, signaling it as a priority.
The Colorado Municipal League is opposed to HB-1001 over concerns that it preempts local control.
“Municipal leaders across Colorado are actively working to increase affordable and attainable housing opportunities,” CML Executive Director Kevin Bommer said in a statement. “One-size-fits-all policies from the state Capitol ignore the unique needs of each community. House Bill 26-1001 would strip away local authority that has been the foundation of responsible growth and balanced planning in Colorado for decades.”
Public transit and housing
House Bill 26-1065 would create a funding mechanism that local governments could use to pay for projects aimed at boosting transit use. Officials could use sales tax revenue collected within one and a half miles of transit stops — dubbed a transit investment area — to fund infrastructure like bike lanes and crosswalks. The bill would allow three projects per year.
Lawmakers passed a bill in 2024 that requires many cities to allow denser housing development near so-called transit corridors, with the philosophy that reliable public transit and housing that working people can afford should be complementary goals.
“We can’t treat every bus stop and light rail station like it’s a Park-n-Ride. People want public transit where they actually live, and workers need housing where bus and commuter routes are available,” said bill sponsor Rep. Steven Woodrow, a Denver Democrat.
That bill would also allow up to $50 million in annual tax credits between 2027 and 2033 to support construction of affordable housing near transit.
Affordable rentals
The third bill, House Bill 26-1066, would expand a property tax exemption for land used for affordable rental units. An existing law established that exemption for land used for for-sale homes.
“Nonprofit providers looking to build affordable rental units are subject to exorbitant taxes and fees in the pre-development phases of the building project. Because of this, we’re seeing projects cut short, long before shovels even hit the ground,” bill sponsor Sen. Matt Ball, a Denver Democrat, said. “Every dollar allocated to affordable housing should go to building affordable housing, not paying taxes on vacant land.”
Both HB-1065 and HB-1066 were introduced on Wednesday afternoon.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The plug has been pulled on a bill that would give the Hoosier Lottery permission to sell tickets online and host instant games on its website. 
The proposal cleared an Indiana House committee on Jan. 8 but had not been called for a vote by the full House. It was scratched from Thursday’s House calendar and won’t advance this legislative session, House Public Policy Committee Chair Ethan Manning said.
“It didn’t have enough support, really, from either caucus on the concept,” Manning told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “I don’t think I could have changed one word in the bill to gain any more votes. It’s just the idea itself. We’re clearly not ready, as a Legislature, to move any further on any forms of online gambling.”
Illinois, Kentucky and Michigan are among 18 states currently with online lottery sales and Hoosier Lottery officials supported the move as a way to boost revenue.
An analysis of House Bill 1078 projected that online sales would increase the lottery’s revenues by between $314 million and $629 million in the third year. That would increase the lottery’s annual profits — $340 million for fiscal year 2025 — by between $31 million and $94 million in the third year.
The lottery’s sales have been flat at around $1.7 billion for the past five years.
Rep. Ethan Manning, R-Logansport, speaks at the annual Dentons Legislative Conference on Dec. 18, 2025. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Manning, R-Logansport, called the bill’s failure “a shame, because it’s one way to get additional state revenue without raising taxes, and we have very few ways to do that.”
“I was hopeful that that argument would help, but it did not,” he said.
A Hoosier Lottery spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Manning’s committee last year endorsed a bill for both online lottery and internet casino games, but it didn’t reach the full House for a vote amid concerns of drawing business away from physical casinos and greater gambling addiction risks.
Manning said this year’s bill faced similar objections despite focusing solely on lottery sales, pointing to worries over online sports betting that was legalized in 2019.
“Sports wagering, having gone so early and Indiana being one of the earliest states to do that, I think that’s hurt our argument for further forms of online gaming, because a lot of members don’t like the impacts,” he said. “They don’t like seeing the advertisements and those sorts of things.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3719-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-22 11:37:21.519553

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Supreme Court Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke on Thursday celebrated the judicial branch’s work to deliver justice to Nebraskans, often at lower costs than incarceration.
In his second annual “State of the Judiciary” speech, made annually before the Legislature, Funke highlighted how the state’s court-overseen problem-solving courts, probation system and more help keep wayward Nebraskans out of prison.

Funke said it costs about $5,000 each year to supervise a participant in one of 35 problem-solving courts, a portion of which participants pay, and about $3,500 each year to supervise an adult on probation.
By comparison, Funke said, incarceration costs state taxpayers about $50,000 each year.
“The work of the Judicial Branch is challenging and regularly involves issues which plague our society,” Funke said. “Support from both the executive and legislative branches is necessary to ensure that we continue to achieve our shared goals.”
Problem-solving courts
The chief justice said more funding would expand the successes of the state’s problem-solving courts. These are “labor-intensive” programs in which judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys and community leaders volunteer to provide targeted support and interventions to people facing criminal charges.
Funke said nearly 2,000 individuals accessed a problem-solving court in 2025, but more people can — and should — be able. That would require more funding.
“Many of those turned away will languish in county jails or end up in our state’s already overcrowded prisons,” Funke said.

Joe Kelly, far left, for the elevation of Douglas County District Judge Derek Vaughn, center, to the Supreme Court.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
A total of 42 trial judges last year volunteered to help problem-solving courts. Most of those judges serve in district courts. However, Funke said more and more county court judges and separate juvenile court judges are getting involved.
Types of problem-solving courts include adult drug courts, veterans treatment courts, reentry courts, DUI courts, family courts, a young adult court, a mental health court and a juvenile drug court.
“The judges’ role in our problem-solving courts is often referred to as the ‘secret sauce’ and is vital to the success of these programs,” Funke said.
In 2024, state lawmakers passed a comprehensive law calling for criminal justice diversion plans for certain eligible veterans through evidence-based treatment and case plans in all Nebraska courts. It’s one of many judicial programs that received strong legislative support and a signature from the governor — but set no funding aside. Sometimes, Funke has said, the court system has tried to absorb the cost.
As the state’s budget worsened, lawmakers last year delayed implementation of the program by two years, to July 2027. No funding has yet to be set aside, with costs estimated at $4.7 million annually.
Probation system
On the probation side, Funke said more than 80% of adult probationers complete probation, contributing to an “exceptional” low recidivism rate of 19%. Recidivism measures a rate of people sentenced who reoffend after release. 
On a given day, there are nearly 14,000 adults supervised while on probation and another 2,400 juveniles, according to Funke. He said juvenile probationers have an “all-time low” recidivism rate of 17%.
The court has, on average, another 1,300 individuals on post-release supervision each day who are not suitable for probation after incarceration. Of them, fewer than 10% are resentenced.

Funke also highlighted the importance of transitional housing, a service 1,400 people accessed in 2025, in which the judicial system provides safe, sober and supportive housing as individuals reintegrate into the community and navigate treatment and employment.
Without transitional living, which could have been at risk with deeper budget cuts, Funke said individuals would risk housing insecurity and an increased chance of reoffending.
Last year, the state probation system launched a grant-funded project in Douglas, Hall and Buffalo Counties for a specialized model of supervising emerging adults, aged 18-25. It’s an age group Funke said stands out as the most “overrepresented” in the state’s justice system. 
Of adults in that age group at higher risk to reoffend nationally, two in five complete probation.
Outcomes from the project are “promising,” Funke said, and more than 60% of participants have not been in “violation status” or arrested on new allegations. The chief justice said state probation systems in South Dakota and Massachusetts now follow Nebraska’s model.
A separate grant from the State Justice Institute, in partnership with Douglas County judges and court staff, also continues to develop plain-language instructions and court forms so people without attorneys can more seamlessly navigate the judicial branch themselves.
Judicial branch budget
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen attempted to veto about $12 million from the judicial branch budget in 2025. The Legislature said the line-item veto had been returned in a way that made it unconstitutional, and Pillen dropped the matter before it escalated to a legal fight, possibly in front of Funke’s court. 
Court officials estimated the veto would have closed four problem-solving courts; all transitional housing reimbursements for adults on probation, post-release supervision or using problem-solving courts for that purpose; and non-required services for juvenile probation, as well as a reduction in reimbursement for placing those youths.
While Pillen suggested he might seek to trim the court budget again this year, Funke’s branch instead found “efficiencies” to contribute to the budget and mitigate cuts.

State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue has also introduced Legislative Bill 1228, at Pillen’s request, which would establish a new baseline “state docket fee” on civil cases and traffic misdemeanors or infractions. 
The fee would be $38 for small claims, $61 in traffic cases, $70 in civil cases in county courts or separate juvenile courts and $116 in civil cases in district court or before the Supreme Court.
Funke, noting the judicial branch understands tax revenues are on the decline and additional funding is limited, said he trusts LB 1228 and the budget reductions will be a “reasonable method to ensure all services are not sacrificed and public safety is not compromised.”
The chief justice has repeatedly said the branch has “exhausted” its available resources at the request of the governor and the funding decisions of the Legislature.
One increasing cost for the courts has been interpreters. The branch offered interpretation for 71 different languages at more than 22,000 interpreting events last year.
The court is implementing a training program designed to increase local interpreter services as costs continue to increase for services, partly due to the need to seek out-of-state interpreters.
‘JUSTICE 2.0’
Funke on Thursday also highlighted the judicial branch’s steps for a modernized online case management system, known now as “JUSTICE.” The effort is known as “JUSTICE 2.0.”
The new system is anticipated to streamline court processes, incorporate electronic exhibit use and retention, facilitate an electronic jury management system, simplify accurate data collection and dissemination, refine the process of collecting court fees and fines and improve communication with court users.

JUSTICE was first implemented in 1994, and Funke said it has saved millions in tax dollars. 
However, tens of millions more dollars are needed to complete the modernization. The courts will first seek increased rates to search court case information, the new docket fee specifically to maintain JUSTICE and file applications for grant funding before seeking new tax dollars in 2027.
Funke thanked state lawmakers for funding his branch in 2025 amid “enormous pressure” in creating the state budget and said the branch remains willing to assist in budgetary matters.
“Over the years, when the three branches of state government communicate well and appreciate the good work of each other, we are all successful,” Funke said. “This year provides us another opportunity to find innovative ways to serve our beloved state.”

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt, New Hampshire Bulletin)Kim Lawrence moved to New Hampshire not for its mountains but for its marriage policies. 
In 2011, Lawrence had been living with her now-wife in a Western state that did not allow LGBTQ+ people to marry. The Granite State was one of the first states to break that trend and pass marriage equality legislation into law. It was an instant draw. 
Now, 15 years later, Lawrence feels less secure. Though the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in the 2015 decision of Obergefell v. Hodges, some LGBTQ+ observers fear the current conservative court could revisit that decision. 
The possibility has Lawrence worried New Hampshire’s statute does not provide strong enough protections. On Wednesday, Lawrence and other advocates urged the House Judiciary Committee to support an amendment to make marriage equality a right in the state constitution. 
“We know how it is to live without those protections,” Lawrence said about her and her wife. “So that’s why I feel like this is really important.”
The proposed amendment, CACR 25, would declare in the state constitution the right to marry as “a fundamental civil right.” The amendment would state that the state of New Hampshire “recognizes and shall protect the right of every individual, regardless of sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, or race, to marry and to have their marriage legally recognized.” It would prohibit any laws or government actions from preventing that marriage, and would bar any unequal treatment. 
The effort has Democrats’ support. Rep. Alice Wade, a Dover Democrat, who is transgender, said she had heard from LGBTQ+ married couples who are scared of the current climate at the Supreme Court. 
“There are Granite Staters who have reached out to me that have been married for over a decade and don’t know how long they’ll have that right. I’ve heard from couples who have already started planning where they’d move to if marriage equality is overturned, leaving New Hampshire, their jobs, and their communities behind just to keep their families intact,” she said. “… You might ask, why? But I would ask, why not? If there is no harm in proactively protecting these rights, why wouldn’t we?”
But Republicans appeared skeptical. Rep. Joe Alexander, a Goffstown Republican, questioned why the amendment would be necessary when the law already exists. 
Alexander, who is gay, said he had not seen a lawmaker introduce a bill to overturn the state’s gay marriage laws in recent year. 
The possibility of the Supreme Court overturning the landmark Obergefell decision seems distant for now. 
In a solo opinion in the 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade, Justice Clarence Thomas stated that outright, writing that the court should “reconsider” its earlier decisions establishing the right to marriage and the right to contraception access. 
But Thomas was writing for himself, and there are currently no federal cases that challenge the Obergefell decision and made it to the Supreme Court. In November, the court denied an appeal to Kim Davis, the former Kentucky county clerk who was ordered to pay a $100,000 fine to a gay couple to whom she had refused to issue a marriage license. That denial blocked the court’s clearest avenue in recent history to revisit Obergefell.
On Wednesday, Alexander argued that even if the Supreme Court were to overturn the Obergefell decision, it would likely take the approach of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization — the decision overturning Roe v. Wade — and send the question of marriage equality laws back to the states.
“If there’s been no proposals whatsoever of rolling back marriage equality, why would we need this?” Alexander said.
Aimee Terravechia, the executive director of 603 Equality, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, challenged that assumption, noting that serious attempts to repeal New Hampshire’s abortion protections emerged only after the Dobbs decision. Should the Supreme Court rule the same for marriage equality, Terravechia said, more challenges might emerge.
“CACR 25 would enshrine what Granite Staters already know to be true in the state’s constitution: that marriage equality is a fundamental civil right,” Terravechia said. 
Another Republican, Rep. Donald McFarlane, of Orange, questioned why marriage should be viewed as a civil right to be enshrined in the constitution.  
As a constitutional amendment, CACR 25 must pass both the House and Senate with at least three-fifths support, and then be approved at the ballot box by at least two-thirds of New Hampshire voters.
New Hampshire passed its law legalizing marriage in 2009, under Democratic Gov. John Lynch and a Democratic-led House and Senate. The law took effect in 2010.
Today, the “equal access to marriage” statute, RSA 457:1-a, describes marriage as “the legally recognized union of 2 people.” “Any person who otherwise meets the eligibility requirements of this chapter may marry any other eligible person regardless of gender or race,” it states. The reference to race was added by the Legislature in 2023.
Since its passage, polling has shown high support for marriage equality in New Hampshire. A Public Religion Research Institute poll in 2022 found that 76% of Granite Staters support the state’s equal marriage law. 
Still, for Kaley Michaels, the prospect of the state’s law changing would be devastating. Michaels married her wife in October at a private ceremony in a New Hampshire forest. Recalling that moment Wednesday, she fought back tears. 
“I’m grateful every day I found my wife,” she said. “… She’s the kind of person who shows up when things are hard. Our wedding was beautiful, and it’s everything I could have hoped for, and I’m choosing to tell you about it because it reflects something very innately human: the desire to love, be seen, and build a life with somebody who feels safe. This right is worth protecting.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1210002-1024x707.jpg,,,2026-01-22 11:37:21.519553

(Photo: Getty Images)More than 53,200 people moved from California to Nevada in 2024, according to Census Bureau state-to-state migration statistics released this week.
That must be because California has high taxes, while Nevada doesn’t even have a personal or business income tax, right? Nevada officials have been saying that for years.
In fact, not all that long ago, before former Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval truly baptized the state in the religion of just cold giving money to billionaires and calling it “economic development,” Nevada’s strategy for diversifying the economy consisted almost entirely of state and local officials telling anyone who would listen that Nevada doesn’t have an income tax.
To this day, area media routinely attribute California-to-Nevada migration, at least in part, to California taxes.
Just as routinely getting less attention, if any at all, is the volume of Nevada-to-California migration. 
In 2024, more than 21,300 Nevadans moved to California, according to the Census Bureau. Or maybe they were just moving back again. There’s been oodles of back-and-forth and maybe back again migration between the two states ever since California miners and bankers decided to make Nevada a state.
But c’mon, well more than twice as many Californians moved to Nevada as Nevadans who moved to California, so California simply must be ickier than Nevada.
Except…
The 53,000 plus Californians who moved to Nevada equaled a little more than one-tenth of one percent of California’s population. The more than 21,000 Nevadans who moved to California were the equivalent of nearly seven-tenths of a percent of Nevada’s population.
As a share of their respective state populations, about sixfold more Nevadans fled for California than there were Californians fleeing to Nevada.
Jobs, family, wanderlust, a beach —  Nevadans head west for a lot of reasons, probably as many different reasons as there are people on the move.
Do some Californians flee to Nevada because of taxes, not to mention other expenses in California? Sure. But why would causes driving Californians to Nevada be any less diverse, varied, and textured than the multiple reasons motivating a proportionally larger number of Nevadans to move to California? 
Yes, anecdotes abound of Californians fleeing for the magical land of no income tax to their east. But the locally popular assumption that high taxation is the giant driver of California-to-Nevada migration is dopey.
Meanwhile, more than 13,400 people migrated to Nevada from its other (i.e., not California) border states, Arizona, Utah, Idaho, and Oregon, in 2024.
And a combined total of 15,400 Nevadans migrated to those states. Proportionally to populations in Nevada and the other four states, about five times more Nevadans left for one of those states than the other way around.
Like California, but unlike Nevada, all four of the other border states have income taxes. But Oregon of course is also terrifyingly woke. Not only is its largest city, as Donald Trump himself has explained, “a burning hellhole.” Both its individual and corporate income taxes are considered complex and burdensomely high.
If taxation equals causation, as per the conventional Nevada narrative, that might explain why some Oregonians would escape to Nevada. 
Taxation could also explain why, proportionally, even more Nevadans migrate to Oregon: Oregon doesn’t have a sales tax.
But just as California’s high taxes are not the only reason Californians move to Nevada, inflation made even worse by high sales taxes whenever Nevadans buy lunch or clothes or dog food or a car is probably not the or even a main reason people leave Nevada for Oregon, or anywhere else.
Nevada, especially Southern Nevada, has long been known for a transient population, stretching back to its nation-leading growth years in the latter decades of the last century and bolstered to the current day by that legacy “ooh, let’s give Las Vegas a try” vibe. People come, give it the aforementioned try, and turn around. 
Some presumably are also disillusioned by the, well, Vegasness of it all — a nice place to visit but, etc. 
And if the truth must be told (albeit at the risk of offending more sensitive readers), hard though it may be to believe, not everyone is enchanted by endless miles of sparsely vegetated dirt.
But Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo has diagnosed perhaps the leading cause for leaving Las Vegas, as well as the rest of the state. The jobs that characterize Nevada’s economy are “not quality jobs,” Lombardo noted last month.
People may also leave Nevada for reasons that have nothing to do with the region’s transactional crassness, desert climate, or low-quality jobs. Or at least not entirely for those things. 
There might be some policy consequences at play. No U.S. state is ideal with respect to child care or public transit or education or health care or housing and on and on. But Nevada has never tried to be.
Nevada politicians and policymakers, along with like-minded residents, love to slap each other on the back when crowing about Californians who flee high-tax California for Nevada. 
In quieter moments, they should also ponder why, on a percentage basis, even more Nevadans leave.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1226284391-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-22 11:37:21.519553

Sarah Silva (D-Las Cruces), one of the co-sponsors for HB35, said the lobbyist transparency bill has been revised for reintroduction in the 2026 legislative session to be more streamlined. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)Two Democratic lawmakers from Las Cruces are again seeking to pass legislation that would require lobbyists to disclose which bills they were hired to work on and disclose their positions on said bills. 
“The hidden role of lobbying plays such a huge role across making different policies and it continues to be a critical issue for the New Mexico government to address,” Sen. Jeff Steinborn told Source NM in a recent interview. 
Currently, lobbyists are only required to disclose their employers, but face no requirement to state which bills they are advocating for or against. For instance, as Source previously reported, it remains unclear to this day why Texas-based Cicero Institute and its advocacy arm Cicero Action had a lobbying presence in the 2025 session. 
Steinborn is co-sponsoring House Bill 35 with Rep. Sarah Silva, similar to a bill they carried last year, which  lawmakers passed but Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham vetoed. In her veto message, Lujan Grisham called the bill’s requirement for lobbyists to file the reports — including a “change of position” on a bill —  within 48 hours of the lobbying activity “onerous.”

Silva told Source NM in a recent interview that the new bill reflects feedback from the governor and lobbyists who opposed the bill. HB35, if approved, would require lobbyists and their employers to file only one report that included the list of legislation and their positions. There would no longer be a requirement to update their positions on bills within 48 hours. 
Silva said making lobbyists publicly disclose their positions on bills allows New Mexicans to see “a full picture” of what’s happening in Santa Fe during legislative sessions. 
“Power moves in three different ways. It’s organized money, organized ideas, and organized people — lobbyists have a significant amount of each of those things,” Silva said. “That in and of itself isn’t a bad thing, but it’s when it’s kept in the dark, it can become very dangerous. And so that’s why this is increasingly important in preserving our democracy.”
According to the records from the Secretary of State’s Office, 67 lobbyists reported spending a little over $166,000 in political expenditures in the latest lobbyist reporting period, which covers the last quarter of the year. The figure captures spending on lobbying activities like meals for lawmakers, special events or advertising.
That puts total lobbyist expenditures at about $1.45 million for 2025. Lobbyist spending had already reached the highest level in at least five years by May of this year, according to Secretary of State data. 
The Secretary of State data includes more than 600 lobbyists who reported no spending in the latest period, though many of them may have failed to report by the Jan. 15 filing deadline and are therefore “out of compliance.”
F-Minus, an advocacy organization that exposes ties between fossil fuel lobbyists and lawmakers, gives the state an “F-” grade on lobbyist transparency, due in part to the fact that lawmakers are volunteer, along with the lack of mandated lobbyist reporting requirements. 
The biggest spender in the last quarter of 2025 is Kimberly Legant, a lobbyist who reports 20 different employers. She spent about $46,000 of the $52,000 she spent all year in the last three months, reporting expenses including $15,000 to New Mexico Senate Democrats, $10,000 for New Mexico House Republicans and $20,000 for two other political action committees. 
She made those expenditures on behalf of Nextera Energy, a power company that has entered into power purchase agreements with Meta, Inc. and PNM for the company’s New Mexico power needs, according to a December news release.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sarah-Silva-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-22 11:37:21.519553

“Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi attorney  wrote on X Thursday, announcing the arrests.
The demonstrators were there Sunday because the pastor, David Easterwood, is an official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

(Photos by West Virginia Department of Health and Kristian Thacker)After Gov. Patrick Morrisey sold four state-owned nursing homes, his proposed budget shows the state will need even more money than last year to operate the remaining three.
The governor is requesting around $21 million more in funding from last year for the Department of Health Facilities’ three hospitals — two psychiatric facilities in Weston and Huntington and a community hospital in Welch.
“There are tremendous needs still with three remaining hospitals,” State Budget Director Mike McKown told members of the House Finance Committee last week. “The sale of those long-term care hospitals will not reduce the total appropriations needed for the health care facilities. Those costs continue to grow very fast.”
W.Va. House Minority Leader Del. Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell
House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, questioned, “So we did sell the four hospitals, but the budget increased?”
Federal money drawn down for the four hospitals sold had been used to subsidize the other three, lawmakers learned. Increased costs for the Public Employees Insurance Agency along with Morrisey’s proposed 3% salary increase for state workers are also adding to the hospitals’ growing budget.
In total, Morrisey says they’ll need $238.4 million for the three state-owned hospitals. 
During his first year in office, Morrisey sold four long-term nursing homes in Beckley, Fairmont, Terra Alta, and West Columbia for $60 million to New York-based Marx Development Group; the state pocketed $52.8 million from the sale. The hospitals, which mostly served elderly patients who had no other options, were in need of $3.9 million in maintenance and operating at a $6 million yearly loss to the state. 
“This is another step forward in improving care outcomes for our patients while protecting taxpayer dollars,” Morrisey said during the close of the sale in November. 
Drew Galang, the governor’s spokesperson, said on Wednesday that providing higher-quality care for the West Virginians in the facilities “has always been the focus of this process.” The sale eliminated the state’s obligation to make $80 million in renovations over the coming years and saved taxpayers approximately $40 million in operating losses over the next five years, he said.
“The savings generated from the sale will need to be poured into the remaining facilities owned by the state,” Galang said. 
‘Critical maintenance needs’ at remaining state-owned hospitals 
The increased financial request for the remaining facilities has caught some lawmakers off guard. They started vetting the governor’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2027.
Del. Daniel Linville, R-Cabell
“I’m a little bit surprised that it appears that their need for an appropriation has increased year over year, as compared to decreased,” said Del. Daniel Linville, R-Cabell.
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, said, “It’s shocking to me that Gov. Morrisey sells four state-run nursing homes proclaiming the state can’t afford to run them, pockets $60 million from the sale, and now comes back to the Legislature and asks for a substantial increase in funding. It looks like he miscalculated.”
Gailyn M. Markham, director of communications for the Department of Health Facilities, said funding previously appropriated for the long-term care facilities has been reallocated to support the state’s psychiatric hospitals. 

“Savings from the sale of the long-term care facilities will be realized over time through the avoidance of future operating and capital expenses that the DHF would otherwise have been required to absorb,” she said. 

The department requested $10 million for what they said were critical deferred maintenance needs, including replacement of windows and security cameras at William R. Sharpe, Jr. Hospital. The department also needs to replace essential surgical scope equipment for operating rooms at Welch Community Hospital.
There are also rising operating expenses such as increased psychiatric patient diversions to other hospitals, Markham said. Sharpe doesn’t have enough beds for patients in need, so they must be diverted to private beds.
“We have more of those people than we have space for, so those diversions cost a lot of money. And they’re continuing to grow,” McKown said. 
Bill would require lawmakers’ approval before selling psych hospitals 
Mildred Mitchell-Bateman Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Huntington, needs to be replaced, according to Markham.
The Morrisey administration may consider selling the remaining hospitals. “The state has been exploring a variety of strategic options to address and ensure the long-term sustainability of our state-owned and operated health care facilities,” Markham said.
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion
Garcia sued Morrisey and Department of Health Facilities Secretary Michael Caruso last year to stop the sale of John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont, which is in his district. Garcia, an attorney, argued that Morrisey didn’t have the legal authority to sell the hospital without the Legislature’s approval. 
A judge ruled in October that Caruso had the authority to sell the nursing home. 
Garcia sponsored a bill this session that would require the department secretary to come to the Legislature for permission if they wanted to sell the remaining hospitals. 
“We should have that debate openly, transparently in the West Virginia State Senate and House of Delegates,” Garcia said. 
As lawmakers vet Morrisey’s budget request, Linville has requested three to five years of data on the state-owned hospitals’ finances, including revenues coming in from Medicaid versus the state to support them.
“Years ago, we’d asked for some additional data surrounding those facilities … and turns out, we didn’t get it,” Linville said. “We just want to sort of better understand the dollars that are in play there and the why.”
He continued, “I want to make sure that we take care of our absolutely most vulnerable, especially those who can’t care for themselves. What is key is that those folks that are in the charge of the state are well cared for.”
Majestic Care, a subsidiary of Marx Development Group, is operating the four long-term nursing homes purchased from the state last year. The company is contractually required to build at least three new hospitals on a set timeline, and they’ve committed $80 million to the project. There is no requirement about where Majestic Care builds the hospitals in the state. 
All employees of the four long-term care facilities had the opportunity to continue their employment with the new ownership at the same compensation and tenure being fully recognized by the new company, according to a news release from the governor.

Mike Thompson, the Republican chairman of the Kansas Legislature's joint auditing committee, says he worries about individuals who intentionally falsify financial information on SNAP applications to qualify for benefits from the food program. The Legislature's auditors released a new report on the state's high error rate for SNAP payments. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Legislature’s auditors confirmed the payment error rate for a food assistance program in Kansas exceeded a federal threshold of 6% during three consecutive years, but the Kansas Department for Children and Families said intervention strategies lowered the rate to 5.5% in August.
The audit report issued to the joint House and Senate audit committee Wednesday echoed information DCF presented in July to the House Select Committee on Government Oversight, which was assigned the task of searching for waste in state government programs.
In Kansas, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program error rate didn’t surpass the 6% benchmark from 2007 to 2018. It was 5.9% in 2018 before surging to 7.1% in 2019. The government didn’t track SNAP error rates during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021.
The 18-page analysis by auditors focused on DCF’s struggle with error rates that fluctuated from 9.1% in 2022 to 12.1% in 2023 and 10% in 2024. In 2023 and 2024, auditors said, DCF attributed half the errors to their own staff and placed responsibility for the other half on program recipients.
“Kansas does not appear to be alone with these issues,” said auditor Heidi Zimmerman. “As of 2024, only eight states had payment error rates at or below the federal threshold of 6%. This suggests that other states are also facing some of the same challenges we are.”
Kansas’ overall 2025 mark for errors as a percent of total SNAP benefits distributed during the year wasn’t available to auditors.
Carla Whiteside-Hicks, director of economic and employment services for DCF, told legislators the state agency employed a consultant, Human Services Group, since October to help whittle down the error rate. The state was also taking part in a mandatory federal corrective action plan.
“We just received our confirmed SNAP error rates for the month of August and we had already come down to 5.5%,” she said. “That just indicates that we were on the right path, and we still are on the right path to be able to bring the error rate down.”
 
Accusation of fraud
Sen. Mike Thompson, the Shawnee Republican chairman of the Legislature’s audit committee, said he was concerned some applicants for SNAP weren’t being honest about personal information.
“To me, if that’s deliberate, that’s not error,” Thompson said. “That’s fraud.”
In Kansas, the average payment under SNAP for a family was about $360 per month. Benefits must be based on a household’s size and net income. Auditors said the most common error in Kansas was miscalculation of an applicant’s income. Discovery of SNAP payments made based on misreported income — most easily caught when DCF performed a six-month eligibility review — would be an example of a SNAP payment error.
The auditors said it was important to note that “not all errors are fraud” because fraud required deliberate misrepresentations, concealment or omission of information to gain a benefit.
The SNAP application form runs 36 pages and contains more than 200 questions. In 2025, about 188,000 Kansans received SNAP aid each month.
Rep. Kristey Williams, an Augusta Republican, said she was struck by DCF’s decision not to provide auditors with access to SNAP applications submitted by Kansans. DCF said such a disclosure to auditors would violate U.S. law.
“Did you ascertain that or did they tell you they could not because of federal law?” Williams said.
Zimmerman, who presented the audit to legislators, said legal counsel advised no exception existed in federal law to allow personal SNAP information to be shared with a state’s auditors.
“I’m intrigued by that because everything that I’m searching says that we should be able to have access to it,” Williams said. “Our audit reports are never going to be really fully accurate if we can’t actually see the applications.”
 
Reasons, fixes
The audit said the error rate was elevated in Kansas because of DCF’s staff turnover rate of 30%, the complexity of the one-year training process for employees handling SNAP eligibility cases and inconsistency in inquiries by staff to verify eligibility for benefits.
Errors could occur at many points, auditors said. For example, some applications were submitted on paper and required hand-entering information into the computer system. The manual of rules for processing and verifying SNAP applications was nearly 700 pages in length, the audit said.
Auditors and DCF recommended the state invest in modification to the KEES computer network in an attempt to reduce errors. DCF said a “chatbot assistant” could be used by DCF staff to quickly reference details of eligibility rules as they processed applications. Use of a document scanning system that automatically populated information fields of online documents could reduce mistakes.
“Long-term planning includes the technology supports recommended by the auditors that create efficiencies and improve quality control detection,” said Laura Howard, secretary of DCF.
The cost of the proposed computer system upgrades related to SNAP would amount to $4.4 million over the next two years. In 2025 , the U.S. Department of Agriculture spent $403 million on direct SNAP assistance in Kansas.
The 2025 One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald Trump put the state-by-state SNAP error rates under greater scrutiny. The law set cost-share penalties to states for error rates above 6%. If a state’s error rate exceeded 10% in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, 2027, that state would be required to cover 15% of SNAP program costs. In Kansas, that would amount to $60 million annually. A rate of 8% to 10% would result in a 10% state assessment and a rate of 6% to 8% would trigger a 5% state obligation.
The USDA funds the cost of SNAP benefits distributed by each state, and has paid half of each state’s administrative costs. In 2027, federal funding for administration costs is expected to be slashed to 25%. In Kansas, the auditors said that could increase state expenditures for administration of SNAP by $15 million to $20 million annually.

(Photo via Getty Images)An Iowa nurse facing federal criminal charges for allegedly stealing patient medications has agreed to surrender his license.
The Iowa Board of Nursing alleges Chad Ryan Hoppe, 49, of Le Mars was working at the Floyd Valley Health Center in Le Mars in March 2025 when he was observed giving an injection to a patient to whom he was not assigned as a care provider.
The board also alleges Hoppe removed fentanyl from the hospital’s automated hospital medication dispenser, but rather than giving the medication to the intended patient, he kept the drug for himself. In addition, the patient’s physician denied giving an order for the fentanyl that Hoppe removed from the dispenser, the board has alleged.

According to the board, one patient was able to verify they did not receive pain medication that Hoppe claimed to have given them.
The board charged Hoppe with misappropriating medications of a patient or agency, and falsifying records related to the practice of nursing.
Board records indicate Hoppe denied the allegations, but asked to settle the case by voluntarily surrendering his license, acknowledging that if the allegations were proven at a hearing, they would constitute actions warranting board discipline. The board agreed to accept Hoppe’s voluntary surrender of his license.
Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Hoppe for comment.
Judge suppresses evidence after warrant is challenged 
In April 2025, shortly after the alleged fentanyl theft took place, the Plymouth County Attorney’s Office applied for a search warrant related to Hoppe’s property but asked that the court seal from public view the application, the warrant itself, all attachments and affidavits, and the return of service documenting what, if anything, was seized. District Associate Judge Daniel P. Vakulskas agreed to that request and the documents remain sealed from public view.
In July 2025, federal prosecutors charged Hoppe with acquiring a controlled substance through fraud or deceit, false statements related to a health care matter, and aggravated identity theft.
Court records show that a nurse who worked with Hoppe at Floyd Valley Health Care had reported providing care for an unresponsive patient who was being transferred to a nursing home, where he was expected to die. The nurse reported seeing Hoppe inject the patient with an unknown substance. When questioned, Hoppe allegedly explained he gave the patient fentanyl after seeing the man shaking.
Prosecutors alleged that after the nurse reported the incident, the hospital investigated and concluded that since at least 2021, Hoppe had been dispensing “substantially more fentanyl” than any other nurse at the facility, and had entered unauthorized “verbal orders” for pain medications under various doctors’ names. The hospital suspected Hoppe had stolen both fentanyl and Dilaudid, another powerful painkiller.
Federal records indicate the sealed search warrant issued by Judge Vakulskas was for Hoppe’s home and two vehicles.  On April 3, several Le Mars police officers executed the search warrant and seized Hoppe’s iPhone 13 Pro Max, according to the records. Police then extracted data from the phone that allegedly included incriminating Google searches about drug theft and fentanyl, and also included snippets of patients’ medical records.
In October 2025, Hoppe’s attorney moved to suppress all evidence collected during the Plymouth County searches, arguing the application for the warrant was deficient and the issuance of the warrant was unjustified. A federal judge then agreed to suppress all of the evidence collected in the search.
The criminal case is still pending in federal court.
Other Iowa nurses who recently surrendered their license include:
Jasmine Johnson of Iowa City — In June 2025, the board authorized Jasmine Johnson, who held an Illinois license to work as a licensed practical nurse, to practice in Iowa. According to the board, Johnson indicated on her Iowa license application that she had a criminal history that included a felony drug conviction that resulted in two years of criminal probation.
When the board authorized Johnson to work in Iowa, it did so with the understanding that she’d complete a substance abuse assessment after which her license would be placed on probationary status for two years. Recently, Johnson agreed to surrender her Iowa license.
Board records indicate only that in October 2025, Johnson contacted the board’s monitoring coordinator and asked for “approval” to voluntarily surrender her license. The board records state that a “statement of charges” was filed in connection with the case, but no charges have been made public by the board.
Loretta Zargboh York of Ankeny — The board alleges that in October 2015, it granted York a license to work in Iowa as a licensed practical nurse, and that in December 2022, it granted York a registered nurse’s license.  According to the board, it agreed to license York after she provided entry-level nursing education credentials issued by Azure College.
The board now alleges that a representative of the college has attested to the fact that York never received the required educational hours or clinical training necessary to receive an associate of science nursing degree from the school.

The memo authorizes ICE officers to use force to enter a residence based solely on a more narrow administrative warrant to arrest someone with a final order of removal, a move that advocates say collides with Fourth Amendment protections and upends years of advice given to immigrant communities.
The shift comes as the Trump administration dramatically expands immigration arrests nationwide, deploying thousands of officers under a mass deportation campaign that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.
For years, immigrant advocates, legal aid groups and local governments have urged people not to open their doors to immigration agents unless they are shown a warrant signed by a judge. That guidance is rooted in Supreme Court rulings that generally prohibit law enforcement from entering a home without judicial approval. The ICE directive directly undercuts that advice at a time when arrests are accelerating under the administration’s immigration crackdown.
The memo itself has not been widely shared within the agency, according to a whistleblower complaint, but its contents have been used to train new ICE officers who are being deployed into cities and towns to implement the president’s immigration crackdown. New ICE hires and those still in training are being told to follow the memo’s guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo, according to the whistleblower disclosure.
It is unclear how broadly the directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. The Associated Press witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of the home of a Liberian man, Garrison Gibson, with a deportation order from 2023 in Minneapolis on Jan. 11, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.
Documents reviewed by The AP revealed that the agents only had an administrative warrant — meaning there was no judge who authorized the raid on private property.
The change is almost certain to meet legal challenges and stiff criticism from advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments that have spent years successfully urging people not to open their doors unless ICE shows them a warrant signed by a judge.
The Associated Press obtained the memo and whistleblower complaint from an official in Congress, who shared it on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive documents. The AP verified the authenticity of the accounts in the complaint.
The memo, signed by the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, and dated May 12, 2025, says: “Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.”
The memo does not detail how that determination was made nor what its legal repercussions might be.
Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in an e-mailed statement to the AP that everyone the department serves with an administrative warrant has already had “full due process and a final order of removal.”
She said the officers issuing those warrants have also found probable cause for the person’s arrest. She said the Supreme Court and Congress have “recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement,” without elaborating. McLaughlin did not respond to questions about whether ICE officers entered a person’s home since the memo was issued, relying solely on an administrative warrant and if so, how often.
Recent arrests shine a light on tactics
Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit legal organization that assists workers exposing wrongdoings, said in the whistleblower complaint obtained by The Associated Press that it represents two anonymous U.S. government officials “disclosing a secretive — and seemingly unconstitutional — policy directive.”
A wave of recent high-profile arrests, many unfolding at private homes and businesses and captured on video, has placed a spotlight on immigration arrest tactics, including officers’ use of proper warrants.
Most immigration arrests are carried out under administrative warrants, internal documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize the arrest of a specific individual but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes or other non-public spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by judges carry that authority.
All law enforcement operations — including those conducted by ICE and Customs and Border Protection — are governed by the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, which protects all people in the country from unreasonable searches and seizures.
People can legally refuse federal immigration agents entry into private property if the agents only have an administrative warrant, with some limited exceptions.
Memo shown to ‘select’ officials
The memo says ICE officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using just a signed administrative warrant known as an I-205 if they have a final order of removal issued by an immigration judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals or a district judge or magistrate judge.
The memo says officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they’re at the residence. They’re limited in the hours they can go into the home — after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m. The people inside must be given a “reasonable chance to act lawfully.” But if that doesn’t work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.
“Should the alien refuse admittance, ICE officers and agents should use only a necessary and reasonable amount of force to enter the alien’s residence, following proper notification of the officer or agent’s authority and intent to enter,” the memo reads.
The memo is addressed to all ICE personnel. But it has been shown only to “select DHS officials” who then shared it with some employees who were told to read it and return it, Whistleblower Aid wrote in the disclosure.
One of the two whistleblowers was allowed to view the memo only in the presence of a supervisor and then had to give it back. That person was not allowed to take notes. A whistleblower was able to access the document and lawfully disclose it to Congress, Whistleblower Aid said.
Although the memo was issued in May, David Kligerman, senior vice president and special counsel at Whistleblower Aid, said it took time for its clients to find a “safe and legal path to disclose it to lawmakers and the American people.”
Memo says ICE officers are told to rely solely on administrative warrants
ICE has been rapidly hiring thousands of new deportation officers to carry out the president’s mass deportation agenda. They’re trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia.
During a visit there by The Associated Press in August, ICE officials said repeatedly that new officers were being trained to follow the Fourth Amendment.
But according to the whistleblowers’ account, newly hired ICE officers are being told they can rely solely on administrative warrants to enter homes to make arrests, even though that conflicts with written Homeland Security training materials.
Lindsay Nash, a law professor at Yeshiva University’s Cardozo School of Law in New York, said the memo “flies in the face” of what the Fourth Amendment protects against and what ICE itself has historically said are its authorities.
She said there’s an “enormous potential for overreach, for mistakes and we’ve seen that those can happen with very, very serious consequences.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26011859826470-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-22 14:37:27.883449

The researchers hope their tool can be used to help address problems such as the annual north Gulf of Mexico dead zone. (Louisiana State University graphic)Scientists from Louisiana State University are using artificial intelligence to help predict and address water quality issues faster and more accurately, with hopes their tools could help shrink the oxygen-depleted “dead zone” that develops annually in the Gulf of Mexico. 
The researchers have developed an AI tool that fills in the data blanks for areas where water testing isn’t available or can’t be verified. To test their technology, they used it to predict how much nitrogen and phosphorus are present in the rivers and streams of Puerto Rico and what amounts are in the soil. The two elements are primary ingredients of agricultural fertilizers, and they can deplete the oxygen content of water by fueling algae growth.
The AI-informed models offer insight into how nitrogen and phosphorus can be retained in soil instead of washing downstream where they can fuel hypoxic dead zones.  
“That’s a big difference that can also help planners and decision makers say, ‘Where do we need to restore throughout the watersheds? … How can we increase the capacity of those places that retain nutrients like this?’” said Mariam Valladares Castellanos, lead author of the paper and postdoctoral researcher at LSU. Her team’s findings were published in the academic journal Science of The Total Environment in October.
Puerto Rico, at 3,500 square miles, is relatively small when compared with the Mississippi River Basin, which covers 31 states. But Valladares Castellanos said the island is a really good research subject because its mountains and coastline provide a wide variety of watershed scenarios to teach the AI model. 
There often aren’t enough water monitoring stations or funding to keep them going for as long as researchers need to understand the full picture of a watershed’s issues with nutrient pollution, Valladares Castellanos said. This has led to gaps in data needed to make accurate findings. 
The hope is that, after training in the lab of Puerto Rico, the same AI tools can be used in other places like the Mississippi River Basin to prevent nitrogen and phosphorus from being washed down the Mississippi River and creating dead zones where fish and other aquatic life can’t survive. 
“When you want to inform policy, you don’t want to have blind spots because then you might be inferring or creating assumptions that then might not apply to those areas that don’t have data,” Valladares Castellanos said.
Matthew Baker, a professor of geography and environmental systems at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, is using AI for his hydrology and restoration work in the Chesapeake Bay area. The technology can make something as complicated as a watershed a little bit easier to understand when trying to fix water quality issues, he said. 
“The exercise now is to examine the many different ways that we can use artificial intelligence to augment our understanding, so not just the ability to predict better but also to understand with greater resolution, greater accuracy, why the watersheds are behaving the way they are,” Baker said. 
With continued research and upping the complexity of the AI-informed model, Valladares Castellanos said tools like this could be used to better inform strategies to reduce the annual Gulf dead zone. 
“We are always trying to get closer and closer to the real world conditions” and lessen the margin of error, she said. “This just gets us a little bit closer to that.”

The district is now planning for a controlled demolition to prevent total collapse, as of Jan. 21, 2026 (Photo courtesy of the Kuspuk School District)Two school districts have filed a lawsuit challenging the state of Alaska for failing to fulfill its constitutional duty to adequately fund public education. 
The Fairbanks North Star Borough School District and the Kuspuk School District filed the lawsuit in Anchorage Superior Court on Tuesday, naming the Alaska Department of Early Education and Development, Deena Bishop as its commissioner, and Gov. Mike Dunleavy as defendants. 
Plaintiffs say the state’s funding is “woefully insufficient,” resulting in a loss of teachers, overcrowded classrooms, deteriorating schools, and loss of learning and opportunities for students. They’re asking the court for a declaration that the state is violating its obligations under the Alaska Constitution, and to remedy the violation by funding education.
A spokesperson for the Alaska Department of Law said education funding decisions should be determined by the Legislature, rather than the courts. 
“The state has to be accountable for ensuring that they have established, and they have maintained a system of education within the state,” said Madeline Aguillard, superintendent of the Kuspuk School District. “Because by all evidence from Kuspuk, I believe it’s not being maintained.” 
Aguillard spoke by phone Wednesday, as she was managing the evacuation of around 50 students from the Aniak Jr. Sr. High School due to a roof failure earlier this week.
It’s one of many severe school facilities issues facing the Kuspuk School District, and other districts around the state. The estimated cost of deferred maintenance is over $400 million in the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District, the other plaintiff in the case, said Frank Meinert, its superintendent. That is all while grappling with budget shortfalls, difficulty maintaining teachers and growing class sizes, he said. 
“Fairbanks has experienced seven school closures within the last five years,” Meinert said. “With declining revenue from the state and drops in enrollment here locally, that was one of the levers that our Board of Education was forced to pull to balance our budgets in past years.”
“Those school closures have created a tremendous amount of instability within the community and within our families,” he said.

Spokespeople for the office of Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development declined to comment on the lawsuit, and referred questions to the Alaska Department of Law. Sam Curtis, a spokesperson for the department said education policy and funding decisions should be resolved by state lawmakers.
“Litigating this issue would primarily enrich counsel by asking the judiciary to referee budgetary judgments the Constitution assigns to the political branches. Again, the responsible path is legislation—not litigation,” Curtis said by email on Tuesday.
“Although we have not been served with this lawsuit and have not yet had an opportunity to review the claims, the Alaska Constitution does not prescribe a dollar amount for education funding,” he said. “To the contrary, it vests the power of the purse squarely in the Legislature and the Governor.”
Education funding has been an embattled political issue for years, and lawmakers approved an increase to per student funding, known as the base student allocation or BSA, last year — which was vetoed twice by the governor, and then restored in a historic override vote in August. 
But plaintiffs say state funding is at a level that fails to provide students with “a sound basic education and meaningful opportunity for proficiency,” and lags far behind operating costs. The BSA has increased by only 2.2% since 2015, according to the lawsuit, while estimated cost of inflation has risen by 37%. 
“Every year, it’s based on, ‘Well, this is what we can afford,’ versus ‘We absolutely have to find the funds to deal with this,’” said Caroline Storm, executive director of the non-profit education advocacy group, Coalition for Education Equity which is helping organize the lawsuit.
In addition to the court order, plaintiffs are asking the court to require the state to conduct an adequacy study. The lawsuit alleges the state has never conducted a study of funding levels, calling it a “dereliction of constitutional obligation” because it hasn’t scientifically evaluated if the current funding levels are adequate. 
The study they’re asking for would assess the actual cost of delivering education — including teachers, special education, transportation and maintaining school facilities — to compare to current funding levels and identify the gaps. 
Plaintiffs cite low test scores as evidence of inadequate funding
The lawsuit asserts the current system is failing “a vast majority of the state’s school age children,” as evidenced by low proficiency in statewide assessments. The plaintiffs say that’s particularly true for rural, low-income and high-need communities. 
Last year, just over 67% of Alaska students did not meet grade level requirements for English language arts, nearly 68% failed to meet requirements for math and 62% did not meet requirements for science, according to the lawsuit.  
In the Kuspuk School District for the 2024 to 2025 school year, those numbers jumped to 93 to 97% of students who were not meeting grade level requirements in those core subjects. In the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District, more than half of students were not meeting those grade level requirements last year. 
“The state has failed and refused to fund education at a level that allows the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District and the Kuspuk School District to provide instruction in core subjects, much less provide instruction in those subjects to state-adopted standards,” the lawsuit said.

Districts grapple with teacher shortage, school building maintenance
The Fairbanks district has lost 300 teachers and staff since 2019, according to the lawsuit, and the Kuspuk School District’s teacher shortage has resulted in cuts to all after school programs, arts programs, career and technical education and social studies programs. 
More and more students are having to take classes online in the Kuspuk district, Aguillard said. “They come to the physical building, and we facilitate and monitor, and we try our best to be able to do that. But it’s not the education our families and our students are desiring or deserve,” she said.
The Aniak community is now facing the total loss of a school building and gymnasium due to a roof failure. 
This week, the roof of the gymnasium, also connected to classrooms and administrative offices was audibly heard cracking and breaking apart. Around 50 students are now displaced.  
“Basically it’s opening like a flower,” Aguillard said, due to the foundation shifting. “The engineer immediately was like, ‘You have to get people out of here.’ It’s not a question of if, it’s a question of when it’s going to finish collapsing.”
Students from pre-K to 12th grade are joining the community’s other elementary school while the district searches for alternative space to conduct classes and move administration offices, Aguillard said. She said the goal is to conduct a controlled demolition before the total collapse of the building. “It’s completely split, pulling off from the building, and then there’s a split where the buildings are connected together, the old and the new pieces,” she said. 
Catastrophic school building failure is not new for the region. The district requested repairs to the school in Sleetmute for over 20 years, and was repeatedly denied, leading to continued deterioration and unsafe conditions for students. 
Aguillard pointed out that as a rural district, a Regional Education Attendance Area, known as an REAA, Kuspuk has no local funding from municipalities so it relies entirely on state funding. “And so the BSA, the foundation formula, has to go to all operational needs to ensure that our students are receiving an adequate education,” she said.
The superintendents and Storm acknowledged that state budgets are constrained, and legislators are faced with many competing priorities and political battles around new state revenues. 
But Storm said the hope is the lawsuit will also send a message to lawmakers to take bolder action to increase funding for Alaska education.
“I think some direction from a court saying ‘You are chronically underfunding our schools,’ gives enough legislators cover to address the revenue issue, among other things, and make some hard votes, because now there’s a court system saying you need to rectify this problem,” she said. 
Meinert emphasized the importance of Alaska education among other state issues. “I can’t think of a better investment in our state than in the children,” he said. “They are our future, and they will dictate the success of the future of this state.”

He told a legislative committee he expects the STAR bonds issued for the project to pay off early, based on projections. (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)  TOPEKA — A Kansas City Chiefs attorney told legislators Wednesday that projections show STAR bonds financing the team’s stadium deal will be paid off 10 to 15 years earlier than the expected 30-year term, upping economic benefits for the state.
Korb Maxwell, a Chiefs attorney, told legislators the planned $3 billion domed stadium and mixed-use development in Wyandotte County, and a $300 million Chiefs headquarters and training facility in Johnson County, will add to the state coffers earlier than expected.
He addressed a joint meeting of the Senate and House commerce committees, where legislators put him on the hot seat for an hour as they attempted to clear up “confusion” and answer constituent concerns about the deal.
Most of the questions, couched from different angles, came down to the dollars — how do the economics of the deal work for Kansas, how will Kansans living in the western part of the state benefit and is the estimated $1 billion economic impact realistic?
While many specifics of the plan are still in planning stages, Maxwell said, the STAR bonds — or sales tax and revenue bonds — are projected to pay off early, which will then push the revenue to the state’s treasury years ahead of time.
The Chiefs project will be funded through a 60-40 public-private partnership, according to terms posted online by the Kansas Department of Commerce. The state’s 60% of funding will come from a mix of STAR bonds and the Attracting Professional Sports to Kansas Fund, which is revenue from iLottery and sports betting. STAR bonds also will be repaid with 100% of liquor sales tax collected in the district.
Aside from expected benefits of 20,000 construction jobs and $4 billion in investment during the building phase, Maxwell touted long-term effects.
“This is also about 4,000 permanent careers, hundreds of millions of dollars in annual payroll once the team starts playing,” he said. “It also includes visiting team payroll, broadcaster payroll, concerts, major national events, Republican or Democratic conventions that could be hosted.”
Sen. Kenny Titus, a Wamego Republican, wasn’t convinced about the economic benefits.
“I do appreciate the optimism that this will be one of the first stadiums to pay for itself in new growth, so it will be interesting to watch that play out,” he said, adding that he’d like to know what happens if in 30 years the Chiefs moved again, leaving an empty stadium.
Maxwell answered by explaining the level of investment being made by the team showed their commitment to the stadium project, and also pointed out the team has been at its current location for more than 60 years.
Sen. Kenny Titus questioned what would happen if the Chiefs moved, leaving an empty stadium behind, during a Wednesday joint meeting of the House Commerce, Labor and Economic Development and Senate Commerce committees. (Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)
“We absolutely plan to be there for the very long term,” he said. 
Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Republican from Stilwell who chairs the House commerce committee, asked Maxwell about information he hears repeatedly that all emails, contracts and other aspects of the deal would be kept private until 2029.
Maxwell said he didn’t know where that idea came from because his understanding was that Kansas open records and open meetings laws wouldn’t allow that to happen.
However, the reference to a July 1, 2029, deadline comes directly from the 2024 special session law that allows the Kansas Department of Commerce to negotiate a deal to move the Chiefs or the Royals to the state.
House Bill 2001 says negotiations and documentation around sports team deals would not be subject to open records requests and would remain confidential until July 1, 2029. 
The intent of the Commerce Department is to maintain transparency, which is why the terms sheet and other documentation were made public on the agency’s website when the announcement was made in December, according to Rachel Willis, director of legislative affairs for the Commerce Department.
After the legislative hearing, she affirmed that even though that language is in HB 2001, the agency will only hold back sensitive information for short periods of time, such as maintaining confidentiality that may affect issuing the STAR bonds. Otherwise, transparency on this deal is important, she said.
Rep. Stephanie Sawyer Clayton, D-Overland Park, questioned the use of other tax incentives programs, such as a Community Improvement District, which would put a special tax on a designated area that would go to pay off the STAR bonds.
“This is the first I’d heard about it, so I am curious to know, do we know where that CID would be, and would it only apply to things that are built after the formation of the district?” she said. “I don’t like CIDs in general, when they include places where people have to shop. We have to get gas. We have to go to the grocery store. I don’t mind economic development incentives when there’s choice involved.”
Maxwell said the CID would be for the development the Chiefs are building and new developments around the stadium. Adding a CID is part of the reason the STAR bonds are projected to pay off more quickly than the 30-year term.
Sawyer Clayton also confirmed with Maxwell that labor used to build the stadium would be primarily union workers.
Legislators peppered Maxwell with questions, including whether work is being done to address needed infrastructure changes in the area where the stadium will be located next to the Kansas Speedway, whether local governments were partnering with the state on the project and how the future looks for economic development around the stadium.
Although Maxwell said many of the items were in early stages and emphasized the Chiefs and Commerce Department are working with local entities, he said the Chiefs are already in discussion with developers interested in being part of the mixed-use development.
“Our phone has been ringing off the hook since the moment that we announced in Kansas on Dec. 22, and we are considering all of those possibilities and looking at, is that right to go in Olathe? Is that right to go in Wyandotte County?” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Korb-Maxwell-20260121_134215-1024x707.jpg,,,2026-01-22 09:36:37.856223

(Photo by Adrian Ashford/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Two dueling GOP proposals designed to stop Democrats from voting in Republican primaries are likely going nowhere after causing a “civil war” within South Carolina’s dominating party.
Rep. Brandon Newton of Lancaster, author of the bill repeatedly endorsed by the state Republican Party, opened Wednesday’s two-hour hearing by saying neither bill should advance amid the internal GOP wrangling. The other bill is primarily sponsored by members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus and backed by U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, who’s running for governor and came to the Statehouse last week to demand its passage.
“This has been the nastiest debate internally I’ve ever witnessed in the party structure,” said Newton, former chairman of the Lancaster County GOP and former state GOP executive committeeman. “The divide on this topic and the divide between two pieces of legislation have truly put, I believe, the party in a civil war.”
The accusations and name-calling flying back and forth on social media is over the top, he said, noting an activist even came to the University of South Carolina at Lancaster, where he teaches business, and put fliers on cars all over campus bashing his bill.
GOP candidate for SC governor demands closed primaries. Gov. McMaster threatens a veto.

It’s unfair to put legislators in the position of “trying to create a kumbaya moment between two warring factions between the party,” continued Newton, who’s also the assistant majority leader of the House GOP Caucus.
Besides, he said, Gov. Henry McMaster has made it clear he would veto either bill: “He didn’t equivocate. He didn’t say maybe.” The Senate has “shown zero interest in taking it up.” And there’s no way it can take effect for the June primaries anyway, Newton said, noting that the process of creating the ballots starts in a couple of months.
The House Judiciary subcommittee heard testimony on both bills but took no vote.
Chad Connelly, who led the state GOP from 2011 to 2013, said it’s been a priority of the party for decades and recalled coming to the Statehouse to advocate for the idea as chairman. With a supermajority GOP Legislature — which didn’t exist in either chamber during his tenure — it’s time to make it happen, he said.
But unless the intra-party strife resolves quickly, which seems highly unlikely, there won’t be another hearing on the bills this year.
Several people said closed primaries are a bad idea because they exclude participation of voters who don’t consider themselves Republican or Democrat, which will further polarize political discord.
Voter participation is already low for primaries, which usually decide the winner of South Carolina contests. Closing the primaries would mean an even smaller faction of the population on the right and left would determine who represents all South Carolinians, said Lynn Teague with the League of Women Voters’ state chapter.
“We believe that independents, who are a growing part of the electorate, should not be excluded,” she said.
Newton agreed, saying any bill that doesn’t allow independent voters to participate is a “red line” he won’t support. His bill would allow unregistered voters to participate, but anyone who voted in a party primary would then automatically be registered with that party. The other bill requires voters to register with the party at least 30 days before a primary in order to vote.
Andrew Boucher, chairman of the Charleston County GOP, said that would create “absolute chaos.” It’s hard enough to get people to the polls. People who don’t know they need to pre-register will be turned away at precincts they’ve voted at for years, he told legislators.
Newton pointed to President Donald Trump’s election to argue against pre-registration. Nearly 140,000 additional voters participated in South Carolina’s GOP presidential primary in 2016 compared to four years earlier. People who’d never voted in a primary before helped fuel Trump’s win in the state’s critical first-in-the-South presidential primary and, beyond that, the White House.
“Barring them from having the ability to vote in a primary is wrong,” he said.
Other speakers said it’s Newton’s bill that prevents participation by narrowing who can run in a primary. They pointed to a provision that requires candidates to have voted in two of the last three statewide primaries. It does allow the party’s executive committee to make exceptions for people who don’t meet that qualification. But that means the party will control who can be on the ballot, they said.
Those supporting the Freedom Caucus bill included Mark Lynch, a Republican running to unseat U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham on his right flank, and GOP candidates vying for the coastal 1st District.

Tyler Dykes of Bluffton, who’s among 10 Republicans running to replace U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, said Newton’s bill would bar his candidacy.
The Marine Corps veteran said he and other military veterans who are busy serving their country won’t be able to meet the two-primary requirement. Dykes would have an additional obstacle, as he was imprisoned for his participation in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol before Trump pardoned him last January. Arrested in July 2023, he later pleaded guilty to assaulting law enforcement but now disputes prosecutors’ accusations, saying his plea was only to get a deal.
Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Alex Pelbath, another 1st District GOP candidate, agreed that the two-primary requirement for candidacy would unfairly keep veterans like him from running.
Rep. Mark Smith of Daniel Island, the only legislator in the 1st District race, took a different tone.
Noting he’s a co-sponsor of both bills, he said he doesn’t care which passes. He also stressed not caring about McMaster’s threat or whether the Senate would consider whatever the House advances. He contended it’s the House’s job to come up with a compromise that can pass.
In addition to Norman, other Republicans running for governor have also chimed in saying they support closed primaries — though without making a demand at the Statehouse.
In news releases, Mace endorsed the Freedom Caucus bill, while Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette and Attorney General Alan Wilson both advocated for the idea without specifically endorsing either House proposal.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_3204-scaled-e1769091405963-1024x620.jpg,,,2026-01-22 09:36:37.856223

Facing insurance claim delays, revolving doors of claims adjusters and payouts that don’t cover the cost of repairs, survivors of last year’s devastating Southern California wildfires still struggle not only with the aftermath of the disaster but also with their insurance companies.
In response to their hardships, some California lawmakers are drafting new bills this session, or reintroducing previously stalled proposals, that aim to regulate insurance companies and make their practices more transparent or timely, writes CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay. 
Some key measures include:

Senate Bill 876 would make various amendments to the state’s insurance code, such as requiring companies to share their disaster-recovery plans with the state’s insurance department; enable customers to know within five days when they’re assigned a new adjuster; and increase penalties for companies that violate fair claims practices during emergencies. The bill by state Sen. Steve Padilla, a Chula Vista Democrat and chairperson of the Senate Insurance Committee, is expected to face opposition from the insurance industry.


Senate Bill 878, proposed by two Southern California Democrats, would hold insurers accountable if they miss deadlines for claims payments by requiring them to pay 20% interest annually. Companies would also have to submit a report to the insurance department that proves they are in compliance with timely payments requirements.


Assembly Bill 1559 is Assemblymember Lisa Calderon’s second attempt at regulating insurers’ use of drone images. The bill would require companies to let customers know when they plan to take drone images of their properties. It would also prohibit companies from ending coverage based on images taken more than 180 days before companies sent notice of the coverage termination. Policyholders would also be allowed to see the images if they want to dispute the insurers’ claims, or take other actions before their policies are terminated. A previous proposal from the City of Industry Democrat stalled in the Senate last year.

Is your wine American enough for you?

Under current federal standards, only 75% of a wine’s grapes need to be sourced in America to be labeled “American wine” — a percentage that’s too low for two California legislators.
Assemblymembers Rhodesia Ransom of Stockton and Damon Connolly of San Rafael recently introduced a bill that would require wine that is produced, bottled or sold in California be 100% sourced from grapes grown in America if it is to be labeled American. Both Democrats represent districts that are vital for California’s wine industry.
The bill does not limit wine imports, change state blending rules or regulate sourcing decisions. It is only intended, said Ransom, to reassure consumers that the American wine they see in California stores is entirely American. The state’s Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control would be responsible for enforcing the rule and determining penalties if passed, according to Connolly’s office.

Ransom: “California produces 80% of the nation’s wine, and we know that California has a high standard of the origins of our grapes. We don’t know the standards of areas outside California. … We want to make sure that when (consumers) purchase something, they know where it came from.”

Ransom said the bill was partly inspired from conversations with California wine growers and by a 2025 law she penned that incentivises businesses to buy California glass bottles. California glass container makers must compete with foreign glass manufacturers, which do not have to comply with California’s various environmental laws and standards.
The wine bill is expected to be heard in committee next month.

(Photo by Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)After a year of ongoing measles outbreaks that have sickened more than 2,400 people, the United States is poised to lose its status as a measles-free country. However, the newly appointed principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ralph Abraham, said he was unbothered by the prospect at a briefing for journalists this week.
“It’s just the cost of doing business with our borders being somewhat porous for global and international travel,” Abraham said. “We have these communities that choose to be unvaccinated. That’s their personal freedom.”
Infections from other countries, however, accounted for only about 10% of measles cases detected since Jan. 20, 2025, the official start of the deadly measles outbreak in West Texas, which spread to other states and Mexico. The rest were acquired domestically. This marks a change since the U.S. eliminated measles in 2000. Measles occasionally popped up in the U.S. from people infected abroad, but the cases rarely sparked outbreaks, because of extremely high rates of vaccination. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine strongly prevent infection and halt the virus’s spread.
To maintain its measles elimination status, the U.S. must prove that the virus has not circulated continuously in the nation for a year, between Jan. 20, 2025, and Jan. 20, 2026. To answer the question, scientists are examining whether the major outbreaks in South Carolina, Utah, Arizona, and Texas were linked.

Health officials confirmed that the main measles virus strain in each of these outbreaks is D8-9171. But because this strain also occurs in Canada and Mexico, CDC scientists are now analyzing the entire genomes of measles viruses — about 16,000 genetic letters long — to see whether those in the United States are more closely related to one another than to those in other countries.
The CDC expects to complete its studies within a couple of months and make the data public. Then the Pan American Health Organization, which oversees the Americas in partnership with the World Health Organization, will decide whether the U.S. will lose its measles elimination status. And that would mean that costly, potentially deadly, and preventable measles outbreaks could become common again.
“When you hear somebody like Abraham say ‘the cost of doing business,’ how can you be more callous,” said pediatrician and vaccine specialist Paul Offit, in an online discussion hosted by the health blog Inside Medicine on Jan. 20. “Three people died of measles last year in this country,” Offit added. “We eliminated this virus in the year 2000 — eliminated it. Eliminated circulation of the most contagious human infection. That was something to be proud of.”
Abraham said vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles but that parents must have the freedom to decide whether to vaccinate their children. Several states have loosened school vaccine requirements since 2020, and vaccine rates have dropped. A record rate of kindergartners, representing about 138,000 children, obtained vaccine exemptions for the 2024-25 school year.
Information on vaccines has been muddied by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who previously founded an anti-vaccine organization. He has undermined vaccines throughout his tenure. On national television, he has repeated scientifically debunked rumors that vaccines may cause autism, brain swelling, and death.
Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University, disparaged the Trump administration’s focus on finding genetic technicalities that may spare the country’s measles-free status. “This is the wrong thing to pay attention to. Our attention has to be on stopping the outbreaks,” she said.
“If we keep our status, it should be because we have stopped the spread of measles,” she said. “It’s like they’re trying to be graded on a curve.”
The Trump administration impeded the CDC’s ability to assist West Texas during the first critical weeks of its outbreak and slowed the release of federal emergency funds, according to KFF Health News investigations. However, the agency stepped up its activity last year, providing local health departments with measles vaccines, communication materials, and testing. Abraham said HHS would give South Carolina $1.5 million to respond to its outbreak, which began nearly four months ago and had reached 646 cases as of Jan. 20.
If the CDC’s genomic analyses show that last year’s outbreaks resulted from separate introductions from abroad, political appointees will probably credit Kennedy for saving the country’s status, said Demetre Daskalakis, a former director of the CDC’s national immunization center, who resigned in protest of Kennedy’s actions in August.
And if studies suggest the outbreaks are linked, Daskalakis predicted, the administration will cast doubt on the findings and downplay the reversal of the country’s status: “They’ll say, who cares.”
Indeed, at the briefing, Abraham told a reporter from Stat that a reversal in the nation’s status would not be significant: “Losing elimination status does not mean that the measles would be widespread.”
Data shows otherwise. Case counts last year were the highest since 1991, before the government enacted vaccine policies to ensure that all children could be protected with measles immunization.

The overhaul has been temporarily and partially blocked by a federal judge, but local housing providers and coordinators like McCafferty have been stuck in limbo awaiting federal funds. Despite the court’s temporary action, McCafferty is bracing for dramatic future program changes that will alter how her team administers housing services to the homeless in Springfield and Hampden County.
“They’re dealing with the stress of: Can I reform a program? How do I do that? What am I reforming? At the same time realizing that the people I provide assistance to may all, or a substantial number of them, get evicted in the next however many months,” McCafferty said. “The stress has been really intense.”  
The move is impacting local administrators of the program across Massachusetts and has threatened millions of dollars in funding for permanent housing and thousands of beds for the chronically homeless. The state received more than $136 million for the program in 2024, of which the Springfield-Hampden County team received more than $9 million. As of 2024, there were approximately 1,300 units of permanent supportive housing for families and 7,600 beds in permanent supportive housing for adults across the Bay State, but the changes proposed by the Trump administration would likely reduce those numbers dramatically.
In 1994, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) developed the Continuum of Care (CoC) program that later established local networks in each state consisting of government agencies, service providers, and nonprofits that document and address homelessness and administer housing and other resources. There are 11 CoCs in Massachusetts, and like others across the country, they each compete for federal funding.
In 2009, HUD began prioritizing permanent supportive housing programs – where residents can stay indefinitely and access long-term services like case management – for federal grants. Given that these funds became the main source of federal money for homelessness, CoCs that were previously offering temporary housing services shifted to the heavily researched “Housing First” approach to receive the funding.
Housing First provides housing by removing preconditions like sobriety that can make it harder to access. The approach stands on the idea that the security of permanent shelter is the first, necessary step before people can address the root causes of their homelessness, such as substance abuse or traumatic life events. It has also been identified as one of the most effective ways to keep individuals in housing and address chronic homelessness.
“There have been multiple randomized controlled trials – the gold standard that’s used in medicine and social science – and they’ve all shown that Housing First has a positive impact on housing stability over multiple years,” said Thomas Byrne, associate professor at the Boston College School of Social Work. “The evidence is pretty unequivocal that it is highly effective for getting people into housing and keeping them housed.”
The largest study of Housing First conducted in Canada and published in 2019 found that participants spent more days housed and were more likely to be housed nearly two years later than nonparticipants.
In places like Springfield – the third largest city in the Commonwealth where rents have spiked along with homelessness since the pandemic – permanent supportive housing has housed some of the community’s most vulnerable residents, keeping those with physical and mental disabilities off the street and out of shelters, where most people eventually exit back onto the street.

“This Housing First approach has been something that’s been embraced by both political parties – first by the George W. Bush administration, the Obama administration, and the Biden administration as well,” Byrne said.
But in November, HUD announced its plans to overhaul the CoC program, significantly cutting funding for permanent supportive housing and instead allocating the funds toward “transitional” or temporary housing assistance with participation requirements. The department scrapped existing grant applications and told providers to apply again under the new criteria.
In a press release, HUD called the reforms long overdue and said they will promote independence, referring to Housing First a failed ideology that “encourages dependence on endless government handouts while neglecting to address the root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illness.”  
The move draws on a provision of Project 2025 that refers to Housing First as a “far-left idea premised on the belief that homelessness is primarily circumstantial rather than behavioral.” The document, which has served as a blueprint for the second Trump administration, calls for HUD to end all Housing First grants, stating that a conservative administration should shift to transitional housing.
In response, around 20 states, including Massachusetts, sued the federal government, claiming it was illegal to drastically alter the program without congressional approval and that last-minute changes would abruptly delay funding and services to vulnerable populations. In December, a federal judge temporarily blocked HUD’s decision, stating that Congress had already approved this year’s funding application for the program.
The judge ordered HUD to process eligible CoC funding renewals for fiscal year 2025 but stopped short of requiring the funds to be distributed. The National Alliance to End Homelessness has warned that nearly a third of all current CoC funding awards expire between January and June. Even if funding for certain projects is renewed, many programs will run out of money before they actually receive the new funding.
The sudden changes and court rulings have sown widespread confusion among local governments and providers. HUD cannot implement their proposed changes to the CoC program until a final ruling is made by the federal court, which is expected in the coming months.
“The timing of it gives no thought to the people at the other end of this – to the people who are trying to create a rational system that provides services to very needy populations,” McCafferty said. 
In its original set of proposed changes, HUD announced that the majority of its grant funds would be more competitive, giving the department more discretion over which organizations receive funding and allowing only 30 percent of projects to be automatically renewed. In the past, nearly 90 percent of CoC program funds were automatically renewed as long as the projects met all requirements.
While the first Trump administration didn’t specifically target HUD’s CoC program with funding cuts, it did begin criticizing Housing First publicly and proposed broader funding cuts to HUD. Also among Trump’s proposed cuts to HUD in the fiscal year 2026 budget is the elimination of some $27 billion in rental assistance funding – most notably Section 8 housing vouchers, which is the nation’s largest housing assistance program – as well as other housing assistance programs for the elderly and disabled.
Permanent housing programs mainly target people who are chronically homeless. Those individuals must have a physical or mental disability, according to federal definition. The Springfield-Hampden County CoC has around 305 units of community-based permanent supportive housing, according to McCafferty, who also serves as the administrator of the local CoC.
“If we lose two thirds of our funding that can go to permanent housing, those are people who will not get the rent paid and will be evicted, and because of their histories, are very likely to be back on the streets,” McCafferty said. “They’re very vulnerable people – a lot of mental illness, multiple illnesses, comorbidities – and those people are now at risk of there being no money to pay their rent.”
CoC providers in Springfield are worried about the impending shift they will likely have to make from permanent housing services to transitional housing, which often requires sobriety, work, or service. But if HUD prioritizes temporary housing projects for funding, local CoCs will likely have to comply or miss out on essential grants.
“If that’s what they’re going to fund, we’re going to put money toward that rather than give up the money, but it does mean we still have 300 people in [permanent] housing to protect, so we’re going to try to figure out how to scrape other monies together to keep them housed,” McCafferty said. “But if you’re going to change it, at least give us time to create new programs.”
In Springfield, McCafferty said shelters are overloaded, and within the last two years, the community has seen homeless counts it hasn’t reached in nearly two decades. From 2022 to 2024, the number of homeless individuals counted on a single night in January jumped from 2156 to 3018, according to annual Point-in-Time Count data released by the Springfield-Hampden County CoC. Housing availability in Springfield is also lacking.
In response to the administration’s attempt to dismantle Housing First programs, experts and advocates have emphasized that rising rates of homelessness are largely driven by high housing costs rather than by behavioral factors like substance abuse. According to the Government Accountability Office, for every $100 increase in rent, there is an estimated 9 percent increase in the homelessness rate.
“The approach here is motivated by a long-standing ideological critique of public assistance programs, blaming people who are experiencing homelessness for the situation that they find themselves in,” Byrne said. “I think that’s at odds with what the evidence shows. In the aggregate, what drives homelessness or increases in homelessness is high housing costs. And here in Massachusetts, we have record high numbers of people who are cost burdened – spending more than 30 percent of their income towards rent.”
Byrne emphasized that transitional housing programs that require people to comply with substance abuse treatment have been found to have high dropout rates, which will burden other systems of care in Massachusetts.
People who are homeless make disproportionate use of acute care services, he said, meaning if more people lose access to housing and end up back on the street, it could have consequences for local hospitals and clinics, many of which already deal with emergency room overcrowding or staffing shortages.
One study using data from Massachusetts found that people who received a Housing First placement had a roughly $10,000 reduction in their use of inpatient care, emergency department visits, and mental health care relative to homeless people who did not receive Housing First placements.  That dollar amount is enough to offset a sizeable share of the cost of Housing First itself, according to Byrne.
“We know permanent supportive housing works, and there’s already not enough of it. There wasn’t enough of it even under the Biden and Obama administrations,” Byrne said. “That’s just going to be greatly exacerbated if these policy changes go into effect, and the net result is that local communities are going to be less positioned to actually address homelessness.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CWB-Featured-Images-Misc-1.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-22 08:56:31.930688
,California,2026-01-22 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Did California’s existential issues scare off potential candidates for governor?,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/california-issues-discourage-candidates-governor/,"Californians may never know for sure, but the half-dozen existential issues imperiling the state, from high living costs to water supply, may have scared off some candidates for governor.","California faces a half-dozen existential issues that threaten the state’s future economic and social wellbeing, and they have persistently defied attempts to resolve them over the last 25 years.
They are — in no particular order, and often intertwined — high living costs, high poverty levels, homelessness, a housing shortage, uncertain water supply and subpar public education outcomes. There are also a number of lesser issues, some being components of what I would consider the “Big 6,” such as a deficit-ridden state budget and a shaky and increasingly expensive power supply.
Gavin Newsom will vacate the office a year hence and probably run for president, leaving some issues slightly better, some slightly worse but all still unresolved.
Collectively, they should dominate the agenda of those we will be electing to office this year, particularly the man or woman who emerges as the next governor. However, they continue to threaten the future because, in a state as large and complex as California, forging a civic and political consensus to resolve them is numbingly difficult.
Could that be the reason why so many potentially viable candidates have decided not to make the run? Is this why the field remains so unsettled, even at such a relatively late point in the political cycle?
Could it be that those who dropped out or never dropped in looked at the daunting array of potentially intractable issues they would face and concluded that failure would be their most likely fate?
We’ll never know for certain what unmotivated them, but the intriguing fact is that several of those who decided not to run would have potentially led the pack, such as former Vice President Kamala Harris, Attorney General Rob Bonta, U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla and Los Angeles businessman Rick Caruso.
Those still in the race are interesting in their own way, but none stands out as an obvious or natural frontrunner and their credentials tend to be on the thin side.
Caruso, who ran a credible campaign for Los Angeles mayor four years ago, was the latest to take himself out of not only a campaign for governor but also one for mayor. He said he was “deeply disappointed to step back from an election I believe is so critical to California’s future.”
“Though my name will not be on a ballot, my work continues,” Caruso said on X. “Public service does not require a title. It is, and always will be, my calling.”
Caruso’s announcement came just a few days after Bonta, who had initially shunned a campaign for governor before saying he was weighing a run, finally announced that he would seek another term as attorney general.
That seemingly leaves just a field of second-tier candidates, as measured by standard political odds-making. In true 2026 fashion, as some drop out, others emerge as potential gubernatorial candidates.
The latest to do so is San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan, a Democrat who has been a sharp critic of how Democrats in Sacramento, including Newsom, have been running things. On the day Bonta pulled the plug, Mahan let it be known that he was considering a run.
Mahan told the San Jose Mercury News that none of the remaining candidates had articulated a “clear and compelling” vision or the “bold and independent leadership” needed to tackle the state’s thorny problems, especially homelessness.
“I see business as usual in Sacramento,” said Mahan, who was at the Capitol advocating for reforms aimed at making housing more affordable. “I don’t see anyone acting like it’s a crisis.”
With backing from Silicon Valley, Mahan could become a formidable contender for the state’s top-two primary in June.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112525-Candidate-Forum-CS-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-22 08:37:04.784322
,California,2026-01-22 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,ICE ignores hard lessons LAPD learned after Rodney King beating,Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/ice-hard-lessons-lapd/,"Federal immigration agents are forgoing the basics that LA police espouse after their years of ignominy: de-escalation, accountability and protecting and serving.","Scenes from Minneapolis raise deep questions about the limits of federal authority, the legality and purpose of immigration enforcement and the specter of masked agents harassing, manhandling and even killing Americans who dare to speak out against their actions. 
Whatever side you land on with those questions, one issue is beyond dispute: ICE is poorly staffed and badly led.
I say that from years of experience covering police misconduct and civilian oversight of law enforcement and seeing the hard-won lessons Los Angeles learned over the past few decades. 
The essential elements of the reforms that remade the Los Angeles Police Department have been conspicuously — perhaps deliberately — lost on federal authorities in their zeal to punish undocumented migrants. Such principles as de-escalation, accountability and commitment to protect and serve the public have all gone out the window. That’s a shame because it was those principles that guided the LAPD away from ignominy and back toward honor.
Take the encounter between ICE agent Jonathan Ross and Renee Nicole Good, a Minneapolis mother of three who had driven her son to school on January 7. Partisans have taken to interpreting the viral recordings of that fatal confrontation in ways favorable to their side, but some elements of the incident are not in dispute.
Ross circled around Good’s Honda Pilot SUV while filming on his cell phone (not his body camera, as some reports have suggested). His fellow agents approached from the driver’s side, cursing and demanding that Good get out of the vehicle. 
Good backed up, then turned the wheel and lurched forward. Ross fired three shots, one through the windshield, two through the open driver’s side window. 
In the aftermath, Vice President J.D. Vance and White House advisor Stephen Miller, along with other administration officials, sided with Ross and declared that he was protected by immunity for actions he took while on duty. 
Each of those steps and statements — none of which are contested — represents a failure of responsible law enforcement.
First, the approach to the SUV. Ross’ decision to film the episode himself on his cell phone is evidence that he did not consider the situation objectively dangerous — he felt comfortable recording it rather than bracing for a confrontation. 
Why, then, did he draw his weapon?
LAPD’s use of force policy anticipates that scenario, warning officers against brandishing weapons too soon. 
“Unnecessarily or prematurely drawing or exhibiting a firearm limits an officer’s alternatives in controlling a situation, creates unnecessary anxiety on the part of citizens, and may result in an unwarranted or accidental discharge of the firearm,” the policy notes. “Officers shall not draw or exhibit a firearm unless the circumstances surrounding the incident create a reasonable belief that it may be necessary to use the firearm.” 
The attempt to wrench open the door of Good’s vehicle, the rough language by the agents and Ross’s decision to draw his gun all escalated the situation rather than calming it down. Those are unsound police tactics.
When Good began to move her vehicle, Ross was standing in front of it — tactically stupid, if he were genuinely concerned about her fleeing. He and others have claimed that the SUV hit him, though videos seem to debunk that, and they definitively refute the claim that he was “run over.”

In either event, his decision to shoot Good through the windshield and open window also defies smart police practice. 
Again, the LAPD’s guide in this area: “An officer threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall move out of its path instead of discharging a firearm at it or any of its occupants,” the policy states. There is an exception; officers may be justified in shooting into a car if the driver is “immediately threatening the officer or another person with deadly force by means other than the vehicle.” But it emphasizes: “The moving vehicle itself shall not presumptively constitute a threat that justifies an officer’s use of deadly force.”
In this case, no one — not even Stephen Miller — has suggested that Good posed any threat other than with her vehicle. She was unarmed and even docile in her interactions with the agents. Agent Ross’ shots into the vehicle violated thoughtful guidelines on the use of his weapon.
Qualified immunity
Finally, immunity. Speaking to reporters two days after Ross killed Good, Vance said the agent had nothing to fear legally. “You have a federal law enforcement official engaging in federal law enforcement action — that’s a federal issue,” Vance said. “That guy is protected by absolute immunity.”
That is both false and unwise. It’s unwise because civilian authorities need to maintain oversight when it comes to managing law enforcement. No one — not conservatives nor liberals — wants armed agents or police who are not answerable to the law. That quickly descends, as Los Angeles learned in the 1990s, into riots and chaos. 
To the contrary, clear rules, backed up by scrutiny and accountability, allow police to do their work and the public to feel fairly treated, a situation good for public and officer safety. Sgt. Stacey Koon and Officer Laurence Powell enjoyed qualified immunity as Los Angeles police officers. Nevertheless, they went to prison for violating Rodney King’s civil rights, and Los Angeles was better for it.
So Vance is foolish to suggest that agents may act with impunity. He’s so wrong that agents may want to consider how willfully he is misleading them.
No statute of limitations
Ross may, for all practical purposes, be “immune” from federal prosecution, so long as lawless executives at Justice and Homeland Security — led, after all, by the cynical Pam Bondi and the laughably unqualified Kristi Noem — use their positions to prevent investigation and prosecution. 
But Ross killed a woman, and murder is often a state offense, not a federal crime. There is no statute of limitations for murder, so Ross is on the hook to Minnesota for the rest of his life for his actions that day.
No ICE agent thus far has been investigated for civil rights violations, much less prosecuted. But neither Vance nor Noem nor Donald Trump himself will be around to shield Ross and his colleagues forever. 
What Vance really is offering is protection — a concept more often associated with the Gambino family than federal law. And his protection is, at best, temporary.
The keys to responsible law enforcement operations are accountability, restraint, dedication to the public interest and thoughtful civilian oversight. Those are the lessons of 1980s and ‘90s Los Angeles, lessons the federal government today is deliberately choosing to ignore. 
Anyone who lived through those years in LA can predict what happens next. Hint: It isn’t good.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/012026-Renee-Good-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-22 08:37:04.784322

As fire survivors continue to navigate life after disaster, California lawmakers roll out new bills attempting to further regulate insurance companies like State Farm. 


Jen Egan is still dealing with the aftermath of the Palisades Fire that damaged the home of her 83-year-old father, Paul, last January. 
That has meant more than a year of going back and forth with State Farm, which has assigned three different claims adjusters to their case. Egan also hired a public adjuster to help her navigate the process, who she says has been a “saving grace.” 
Egan and her father have received some payouts and are preparing to make repairs to the home. But this week, they received an estimate for compensation that falls tens of thousands of dollars short of what Egan said they have already paid out of pocket to address a brush violation issued by the fire department, and to conduct soil testing. 
She is growing more frustrated. “No one’s asking for a new jacuzzi,” Egan said. “We want my father to be able to return to a safe and habitable home.”
Stories like the Egans’ are all too common after last year’s deadly Los Angeles County fires. State Farm says it has paid $5 billion so far on more than 13,500 claims. But survivors express frustration over insurers’ poor and delayed communication. 
State Farm customer Rebecca McGrew has no outstanding complaints about her claims after her Altadena home burned down — except that she was “drastically under-insured by hundreds of thousands of dollars.” Many others like her have realized — too late — that their insurance payouts won’t cover all of their rebuilding costs. 
Survivors and community organizations that have formed after the fires have asked their local and state elected officials for help in dealing with these varied issues. Some of the bills introduced in response to survivors’ experiences include attempts to address the transparency and timeliness related to insurers’ handling of fire claims. 
More stringent requirements for insurers
Senate Bill 876 is a wide-ranging bill that seeks to make various amendments to the state’s insurance code. They include getting insurance companies to share their disaster-recovery plans with the insurance department; doubling penalties from $5,000 to $10,000 for each violation of fair claims practices during declared emergencies; and requiring insurers to notify policyholders within five days when they’re assigned a new adjuster. 
In addition, the legislation, proposed by new Senate Insurance Committee Chair Steve Padilla and sponsored by Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara: 

Expands policy limits for required payments for additional living expenses by 100% in case of a total loss. 
Requires upfront, cash-value payments be made within 30 days of a contract to buy or rebuild a home. 
Requires insurers to offer extended and guaranteed replacement cost coverage when writing policies.
Applies building-code upgrade coverage at the time of a rebuild.  

“People need a sense, particularly when they face tragedy, that the underwriters they’ve relied on and paid into for decades, will want to help and not get in the way (of recovery),” said Padilla, a Democrat from Chula Vista, in an interview with CalMatters.
He acknowledged that the insurance industry will have objections to his bill, but said the companies know that they need to provide adequate coverage for the health of the insurance market.

Padilla is right about the industry’s opposition. “It appears these measures would worsen the current affordability and availability crisis for Californians just as we are starting to implement the Commissioner’s Sustainable Insurance Strategy to restore a healthy and competitive market,” said Seren Taylor, vice president at Personal Insurance Federation of California, in an email. 
Lara’s strategy, which went into effect last January just days before the L.A.-area fires, aims to get insurance companies to start writing policies in the state again, especially in areas at high risk of fires. Many insurers had pulled back from the state in the past few years, complaining of increasing fire risks and state regulations that they said slowed down their ability to match prices to those risks.
Tornadoes and drones
Meanwhile, Senate Bill 877 would require insurance companies to provide claims-related documents to policyholders within 15 days. Co-authored by Democratic Sens. ​​Sasha Renée Pérez of Pasadena and Ben Allen of El Segundo, the legislation would also require insurers to disclose changes to repair estimates, who approved them and why.
Senate Bill 878 would require insurers to pay interest of 20% annually if they fail to meet deadlines for claims payments. The bill, also written by Pérez and Allen, will compel companies to submit to the state’s insurance department a report, signed by a corporate officer under penalty of perjury, that shows the company’s compliance with prompt payments requirements.
In the Assembly, lawmakers plan to introduce bills that will “continue to make sure we have oversight (of insurers),” said Assemblymember Lisa Calderon, the Los Angeles-area Democrat who also chairs the Assembly Insurance Committee, in an interview. She said she expects bills to address strengthening and modernizing the FAIR Plan, as well as mitigation efforts for natural disasters.
She mentioned that California has to deal with fires, floods, earthquakes and, last year, something rare: “Last year, we had two small tornadoes in urban Los Angeles. I can’t remember another year when it’s happened.”

Calderon is trying again to regulate insurers’ use of drone images by introducing Assembly Bill 1559. Her similar effort last year passed the Assembly and made it through some Senate committees but ultimately didn’t advance. This year’s bill would require companies to notify consumers about when they plan to take aerial images of their properties; ban insurers from ending coverage based on drone images taken more than 180 days before sending notice of that decision to policyholders; and require companies to provide the images to policyholders, allowing them to dispute accuracy and to take action if needed before having their policies terminated.
“We’ve been hearing from consumers that they’ve been blindsided by these images that were inaccurate,” she said. “I believe homeowners should have the right to request an in-person inspection.”
She also intends to introduce legislation to implement recommendations from a forthcoming report about the California Wildfire Fund that she expects to include provisions related to the availability and affordability of property insurance in the state.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/042425_Dixon-Trail_AH_CM_24.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-22 08:37:04.784322

Heather Bourbeau
Heather Bourbeau is a poet and fiction writer who has worked with various United Nations agencies.


I visited the newly designated Sáttítla Highlands National Monument this June as part of a series of trips I was making through national lands at risk of losing federal protection. 
Over the course of 10 months, I traveled to 40 national forests, monuments, parks, and other designated public lands in eight Western U.S. states. I collected field recordings, made short videos, took photographs and wrote poetry. 
I set out to document these lands before they were lost or irrevocably altered. What I learned was just how devastating these losses would be to all Americans.
Encompassing 224,676 acres in Northern California’s Modoc, Shasta-Trinity, and Klamath national forests, Sáttítla Highlands is home to bald eagles, black bears, salmon, trout and many threatened, endangered or rare species of plants, insects and animals, as well as massive underground volcanic aquifers that supply water to millions of people. 
Sáttítla — which means “obsidian place” in the Ajumawi language — also includes part of the ancestral homelands of the Pit River (Ajumawi–Atsugewi) and Modoc Peoples (Mo Wat Knii–Mo Docknii) and is central to their spiritual beliefs and cultural practices, as well as that of a number of other local tribes, including the Karuk, Klamath, Shasta, Siletz, Wintu and Yana. 
President Joe Biden designated it a national monument in January 2025, days before he left office. Nearly four months later, President Donald Trump issued a memorandum pushing to rescind Sáttítla Highlands’ protected status as a means of combating a national “energy emergency.”  
I drove a mostly empty highway there out to Medicine Lake, in the summit caldera of the Medicine Lake Volcano, which covers an area nearly 10 times that of Washington’s Mount St. Helens. For approximately two decades, the U.S. government has designated much of the land surrounding the lake a “traditional cultural property district,” which means that the appropriate Native American tribes must be consulted in project and program planning of this sacred site and place of healing — though it does not necessarily restrict development on these lands.

It seemed I was alone when I parked my car, save for one person fishing in the distance. I hiked briefly into woods that hugged the water. Tiny chipmunk squeals overtook the bird sounds, small periwinkle butterflies and infant moths mixed in the air and small mammal scat dotted the trail. 
Eventually I came upon other people, mostly there to camp and fish. As I walked along the shore of the lake, I spotted a grandmother and granddaughter collecting tadpoles. When I remarked that the water was warm enough for swimming, the grandmother reminded me of how dire and recent our drought years are: Two years ago, she recalled, the water was so low that she and her husband were able to walk the perimeter of the lake. 
That’s a striking aspect of Sáttítla Highlands that most people do not see — the porous volcanic rock that filters rain and snowmelt into one of the biggest underground aquifer networks in the United States. 
These caverns — which store as much water as California’s 200 largest surface reservoirs — supply water to the state’s largest spring system. This impacts millions of Californians, including farmers who use the water to feed the nation. I have been its unwitting beneficiary much of my life, as a teen in Sacramento and as an adult living in the Bay Area. 
Beyond the aquifers, Sáttítla Highlands is home to 19 plants and dozens of animals and insects considered threatened, endangered or rare in California, including the whitebark pine, the rare talus collomia, the northern spotted owl, Cascades frog, long-toed salamander, Townsend’s big-eared bat, the Sierra Nevada red fox and the Franklin’s bumblebee, which has one of the most limited geographic distributions of any bumblebee in the world. 
Nowhere in the monument is there signage explaining the small miracles of freshwater stored and distributed through these aquifers, nor telling of the biodiversity that leads to, among other benefits, better soil health, increased carbon storage, improved flood control and improved air and water quality. Nowhere is there mention of the oxygen that mature trees produce: One mature tree can produce enough oxygen for four people a day.
The Trump administration’s attempt to rescind Sáttítla’s National Monument designation will put all this life at risk. In addition to devastating areas of cultural importance for Indigenous tribes, millions of people throughout the West will feel its effects on our water, air and climate.  
I thought of this as I watched the granddaughter continue to scoop cups full of tadpoles to admire then release. Studying her, I was reminded of how this kind of engagement led my cousin to become a marine biologist and led me to write of the beauty and sustenance such lands offer.
I wondered if the people seeking to end the protection status of this land understood all that was at risk.

Their answers showed only occasional differences on matters of policy. The greater contrasts were in style, tone, vocabulary and presentation.

Answering an audience member’s question about how each of the hopefuls would address Wisconsin’s teacher shortage, Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez drew attention to a new state program to create teacher apprenticeships — enabling working teaching assistants “to get a bachelor’s degree while they are teaching assistants with full-time wages, full-time benefits. They will graduate with no debt.”
It was modeled after a similar apprenticeship program to produce more nurses, noted Rodriguez, a nurse who entered politics in mid-career.
Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said prospective teachers should be encouraged, but added that working teachers also need support after years of being demoralized by disrespect and inadequate funding from the Republican-led Legislature.
“We have to create a much better pipeline, making sure that we’re supporting those who are currently in the profession and utilizing them to be the trusted messengers to help recruit more young people into the field,” he said.
“Put a stake in Act 10, and repeal it, and ensure that it never happens again,” said state Rep. Francesca Hong — referring to the 2011 law that stripped most public employees of most union rights and that has been blamed for contributing to teacher shortages in Wisconsin. “Fully fund public education. Reimburse special education at 90% from the state, in parity with voucher schools,” she said, adding, end the voucher program “so we no longer siphon away resources from our public schools to private schools.”
State Sen. Kelda Roys, former Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. CEO Missy Hughes, former Department of Administration Secretary Joel Brennan and former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes also took part in the Wednesday night forum.
With Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ decision this past July not to run for a third term, the 2026 governor’s race is the first in Wisconsin without an incumbent since 2010. It has drawn a broad field of potential successors in Evers’ own party.
Cletus Hasslinger, 78, of Milwaukee, attended a similar forum back in 2018, when Evers was one of 10 candidates seeking the Democratic nod to run for governor. He turned out for the Wednesday night event and was impressed.
“This is a much stronger group!” Hasslinger said. “It energizes me.”
Sponsored by small business advocates
The forum was held at The Cooperage, a venue in the shadow of Milwaukee’s iconic Hoan Bridge, and was organized by Main Street Action, the political arm of Main Street Alliance. MSA is a small-business organizing group with an agenda centered on economic fairness, contrasting many of its interests with those of large corporations.
The group has embraced the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid expansion and state and federal support for child care and paid leave for workers, among other policies. MSA also campaigns for tax policies that would require big business to pay more and stronger government action against corporate concentration.
“We elevate the testimony, the stories of small business owners,” said Richard Trent, MSA’s national executive director, who counts MSA’s national membership at 30,000 people and said Wisconsin is one of the organization’s hubs.
“So much of how we think about our economy, how we think about what’s best for our cities, our towns — that whole narrative is shaped by the largest corporations, the wealthiest Americans,” Trent told the Wisconsin Examiner. “It’s the small business owners who are driving most of the productivity in our economy, yet get almost none of the say in the policies that actually strengthen their communities.”
The eighth Democrat seeking the nomination, former state Rep. Brett Hulsey, was not invited to join Wednesday night’s forum, which qualified participants if they were polling at better than 0% or if they had raised at least $100,000 in donations.
U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany and Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann are seeking the GOP nomination. Trent said there aren’t plans for a Republican forum before that party’s primary, also in August, but that MSA intends to bring the winners of both nomination contests together for a forum in the fall.
Questions draw out similar stances
Moderated by Dan Shafer, who publishes “The Recombobulation Area” political analysis and opinion column on Substack and who holds the title of political editor at Civic Media, the forum ran about 20 minutes over its original allotment of 90 minutes.
Shafer brought a half-dozen business owners and Main Street Alliance members to the stage, each posing a question to the gubernatorial hopefuls, then finished the session with a handful of questions submitted by audience members.
Many of the answers didn’t diverge wildly. Expanding BadgerCare to cover more people had broad support. So did the idea of a BadgerCare “public option,” enabling people to pay into the Medicaid-funded health plan if their incomes were not low enough to qualify them for the program.

Roys suggested another variation, allowing Wisconsin residents to buy into the health plan that is available to state employees.
Support for child care funding from the state was also widely endorsed, as was a paid leave program funded through a payroll deduction.
Rodriguez observed that a paid family leave program was in “the last budget that the governor and I put out” (it was cut by the Joint Finance Committee’s GOP majority). Crowley said after he took office as Milwaukee County executive, his administration created a paid family leave policy for county employees to help recruit workers.
Hong pointed to legislation she introduced in the Assembly in the previous session that would have created “one of the most comprehensive paid leave” programs. And Roys cited a paid leave bill she co-authored in 2011, during her previous time in the Legislature.
“Making this universal is going to help small businesses start,” Roys said. “It’s going to help them attract and retain employees and compete with the big businesses who can afford to offer more generous policies.”
Core themes and personal biographies
All seven participants largely stuck to the core themes they’ve sketched out in their campaigns and the biographical details that they hope will persuade primary voters in August why they’re the best choice to carry the party’s standard in November.
Rodriguez highlighted her current role as lieutenant governor — visiting “all 72 counties every year” since assuming that office. She led a health care workforce task force that Evers appointed in 2024.

Crowley emphasized ways in which, as a county executive, he has to deal with issues at the local level that the forum was putting on the agenda for the next governor: housing, health care costs, family leave policies and preparing for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers to descend on Milwaukee.
Hong stressed her experiences as a restaurateur and as a single mom, and her stark assessment that “as a worker and as an employer, the system is rigged against us where people value corporate power and greed more than anything else.”
Roys presented herself as a fierce challenger to the Republicans controlling the White House and Congress: “We need a governor with a spine of steel who will stand up to this Republican regime in all the ways that they are hurting Wisconsin, and especially our small businesses and our family farmers,” she said.
But Roys also declared herself to be experienced in the operations of state government, having had a state Assembly seat previously during the administration of Gov. Jim Doyle and the beginning of Gov. Scott Walker’s first term. And she cast herself as a visionary who sees “a window of opportunity to make real change” in Wisconsin in the coming years.
Hughes said that in her time at WEDC, “I have worked with small businesses all across the state, with Main Street businesses working to understand the challenges that they face,” including day-to-day operations, finding workers and supporting employees who need child care or other resources.
She called attention to an economic plan she released this week with provisions for education, labor-management partnerships and expanding affordable housing.
Brennan described himself as an experienced problem-solver and relationship builder, and a voice for calm in a time of turmoil.
“We live in times that are unlike any other. And we are angry. We’re angry at Donald Trump for what he has done to really do away with some of the values that we hold dear as Americans and as citizens,” Brennan said. “But when some people get angry, they want to get even. When I get angry, I want to roll up my sleeves and get something done.”
Pandemic relief roles
Hughes and Barnes both emphasized roles in Wisconsin’s Main Street Bounceback program, which provided $10,000 grants for businesses to upgrade their operations, including taking over vacant storefronts, in downtowns across the state. Barnes was lieutenant governor in Evers’ first term, forgoing reelection in 2022 in order to run for Senate against Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, a race he lost by about 26,000 votes.

Barnes’ executive branch duties included helping to promote “our Main Street Bounceback program, which helped so many small businesses across the entire state that had been dealt a bad hand,” Barnes said. “We stepped up, we filled the gap, and we met a need. That’s exactly what I intend to do as governor.”
Hughes brought up the program when Chloe Longmire, a Milwaukee entrepreneur, asked the candidates how they would work with economic development agencies to help women-owned and minority-owned small businesses.
“Coming out of the pandemic, I saw across the state Main Streets where businesses had survived and businesses had not survived, and there were vacant spaces,” Hughes said. Main Street Bounceback was designed to enable businesses to occupy vacant spaces easily, with a one-page application and the support of a community member.
“And we trusted those business owners to invest that money in the ways that needed to happen,” Hughes said, with 9,500 businesses in each of Wisconsin’s 72 counties getting aid. “We saw Main Streets at 100% capacity — full, looking for more businesses, looking for more opportunities to move businesses into vacant spaces.”
Brennan, as secretary of the Department of Administration, tracked how the state’s $4.5 billion in pandemic relief was spent. A program focused on movie theaters made a particular impression, he said, with one memorable venue in central Wisconsin that passed through three generations to the granddaughter of the first owner.
“And the $30,000 that they were getting from the COVID relief money was going to pay for utilities, going to pay for their mortgage — it was going to be the light at the end of the tunnel,” Brennan said. “That’s the kind of thing you need to do in a crisis, but it’s also the way you need to be responsive when you’re operating day-to-day, and that’s what we’ll do in a brand new administration.”
After reiterating his involvement in Main Street Bounceback, Barnes pivoted to the original question’s emphasis on businesses owned by women and minorities.
“We should have to incorporate targeted investments in communities,” he said. From there he pivoted again, to a proposal he announced earlier Wednesday for the state to invest in grants for startup grocery stories in food deserts.
“People aren’t able to afford groceries, and we’re going to connect our family farms . . . to bring local food into communities because we can’t have a food desert in a state that produces as much food as we do in Wisconsin,” Barnes said.
A range of answers on taxing the rich
Questions about Wisconsin taxes drew a wider variety of responses.
Roys dismissed the manufacturing and agriculture tax credit, available primarily to larger businesses, as “a giveaway to the wealthiest individuals and corporations in the state” that fails to help economic development.
“We need to restore our progressive taxation system where the amount of money that you pay in to support the public services that all of us enjoy and all of us rely on is based on the money that you earn,” she said. “Right now, working people, the middle class are shouldering a disproportionate burden for paying those services.”
Hong was equally dismissive. “Our small businesses are paying a higher tax rate than some of the wealthiest corporations,” she said. “So, get rid of it. No major corporations should be paying no income tax.”
Crowley said tax credits should focus on small and mid-size companies. “Millionaires and billionaires, let’s face it, they don’t deserve a tax credit,” he said, adding that he would favor a blue ribbon commission to examine state taxes and spending comprehensively.
Rodriguez called for measurable job gains in return for the credit. “If we are going to get tax benefits, we need to tie it to actually increasing the number of people that they are hiring,” she said.
Hughes said that when she was at WEDC and met with business leaders looking to relocate to Wisconsin, they were much less interested in taxes than issues such as the strength of local schools and the university system and the availability of workers.

She demurred on a question about raising taxes on the wealthiest to provide services for people in need and suggested that a sustainable economy is more important.
“My focus is going to be on growing the economy, because my fear is that if we simply increase taxes on the wealthy, the next team will get elected and come back in and take that away,” Hughes said.
“It could mean that we increase taxes on the most wealthy, but in addition to that, we need to be thinking about creating a system that works election after election and administration after administration,” she said. “Growing the economy and making sure that everyone is paying their fair share is the foundation of my candidacy.”
The last question of the night looked to the unease that has been gripping the country after federal immigration agents descended on Minneapolis earlier this month and an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Minneapolis resident Renee Good as she sat at the wheel of her van near her home.
How would each of the Democratic hopefuls navigate “maintaining law and order and avoid being positioned by the right as being soft on crime, while ensuring the state citizens won’t be infringed upon by federal government overreach?” Shafer asked, reading from a written submission.
Rodriguez cited her recent statement calling on lawmakers to apply the same rules for ICE as for local law enforcement: ready identification, body cameras and no masks for agents, and forbidding them from going into “sensitive areas” such as schools without a judicial warrant.
“It is personal to me,” said Rodriguez, whose husband is a U.S. citizen born in Mexico.
Crowley said Milwaukee County is currently discussing how it will respond to an ICE influx. “Standing up for people’s constitutional rights, whether a citizen or not, is not soft on crime at all, he said. “We have to make sure that we continue to protect everybody and make sure that we are a safe community.”
Hong said she’s been in touch with mutual aid groups in Minneapolis, and that “ICE is a rogue agency…. Abolishing ICE is a meaningful policy.” Roys vowed to bring the weight of criminal as well as civil liability down on ICE and act against people who “break our laws and brutalize our people.”
Hughes said at meetings in Eau Claire, community leaders told her they are looking to members of the immigrant community “and understanding what they needed and what they were looking for.” Brennan urged learning from the civil rights work of Martin Luther King Jr., “locked in arms with his fellow man and with the people in his community.”
Barnes said he has spoken with people in Minneapolis, and said the next governor must be unafraid of retribution from the White House. “We need change and somebody who’s going to stand up and be strong in this moment,” he said.

That is the attitude some state lawmakers have about the Vegas Loop, Elon Musk’s Boring Company project, a 4-mile underground tunnel system beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center that critics fear is expanding faster than its oversight.
Nevada State Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat whose district includes the convention center, during an interim legislative meeting Wednesday questioned the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA)about its persistent enthusiastic support for Boring Co.
“What we’ve seen over the last several years is that there are continuous concerns — environmental concerns, labor concerns,” he said. “And so I guess the question becomes: To what extent are we sacrificing our workers and our communities at the expense of our taxpayers to subsidize or support a company without essential oversight.”
Doñate referenced numerous high-profile incidents at Boring’s construction sites, which have included a “crushing injury,” workers and firefighters enduring chemical burns, and digging errors that exposed the foundation of two Las Vegas Monorail columns.
Overall, Nevada state regulators have accused the company of nearly 800 environmental violations, according to reporting from ProPublica and City Cast Las Vegas. Boring Co. has also been cited by the Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Some of those citations were rescinded after Boring Co. president Steve Davis called Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office, raising concerns of backdoor deals and a deep-pocked company’s ability to skirt regulatory oversight, according to reporting by Fortune. 
The governor’s office has disputed that report. Democratic Assemblymembers Cinthia Moore and Venise Karris, both Democrats from Las Vegas, have publicly called on the Clark County District Attorney’s Office to investigate the accusation.
An LVCVA official during Wednesday’s meeting acknowledged the publicly reported safety issues at Vegas Loop construction sites.
“There have been events, and we should have been better,” said Ed Finger, the authority’s chief strategy officer. “The Boring Company should have been better than they were. It is The Boring Company’s goal to be better.”
But Finger also seemed to suggest the incidents might not be out of the realm of normalcy. He also told lawmakers that, on the rider experience side, the Vegas Loop has had a “near flawless” operational safety experience.
“I’ll suggest to you that reasonable people can have a difference of opinion about how much of that was built safely and done well, versus those events, and what happens across multiple-year total construction projects and transportation projects in general,” he said, addressing Doñate.
Finger said the LVCVA has “attempted to improve our awareness, and our coordination and understanding” of safety concerns on the construction sites.
He emphasized the LVCVA has no technical or contractual responsibilities with regulatory agencies like OSHA but is choosing to be proactive, including sending their own ex-OSHA employee into the field “on a periodic basis.”
Finger said the mission of LVCVA is “to maximize the biggest economic engine in the State of Nevada,” meaning the Las Vegas Strip.
“We believe it’s within our purview to attempt to work with our Southern Nevada partners to also try to facilitate improvements in the Strip resort corridor, specifically transportation,” he added.
That mission drove the acquisition of the Las Vegas Monorail after its second bankruptcy, he said, and it drives the facilitation of the Vegas Loop.
“We have a sincere, vested interest in the success of this destination,” said Finger. “We believe that The Boring Company system will be transformative to Strip corridor transportation and will be a unique asset that further separates Las Vegas as the greatest tourism destination in the United States of America and competitive in the world.”
Vegas Loop presentation materials state there are currently eight operational stations at the convention center, Encore, Resorts World, and Westgate. An additional 15 are expected to become operational in the next few months.
“We’re at a current pace of better than a million passengers per year,” Finger told lawmakers. That’s “about a quarter” of the ridership volume of the monorail.
But Boring has been approved for 68 miles of tunnels and 104 stations.
If those ambitious goals actually come to fruition, it would be the second largest tunnel transportation system in the country, behind only the New York City subway system, according to Vegas Loop materials.
The annual ridership of the New York City subway system was 1.2 billion in 2024.
Some of Boring’s original plans for stations have already fallen through. UNLV denied the company’s offer to build a station on campus for free, according to the Las Vegas Weekly. The university cited parking enforcement as the primary reason.
Meanwhile, Nevada’s entanglement with Boring Co. could grow beyond Las Vegas. According to reporting from Fortune, the Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada (EDWAN) is conducting a feasibility report for a potential tunnel project leading to Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center (TRIC), where Musk’s Tesla Gigafactory is located.
Environmental groups like the Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter have already publicly vowed to fight any proposals by the company.
“My responsibility is to protect Nevada’s land, water, and communities from harm, and that responsibility requires me to oppose this project outright, and forcefully, given the Boring Company’s egregious record of environmental violations already in Nevada,” said Executive Director Olivia Tanager in a statement Sunday.
A monorail? A taxi? A limousine, kinda?
The ultimate vision is for the entirety of Vegas Loop travel to happen within the tunnels, Finger told lawmakers on the interim legislative committee on revenue, but before that vision is fully realized there exists “an interim opportunity” for above-ground transportation connecting passengers from existing stops in the tunnel system to future ones, most prominently Harry Reid International Airport.
Last year, a Boring subsidiary called Paradise Transportation received approval from state regulators to transport people above-ground, so long as the trips include the underground system.
State Sen. Dina Neal, a Democrat from North Las Vegas, said the question for the interim revenue committee is: What changes when the Vegas Loop Teslas emerge from the tunnels and begin operating on surface streets?
The Vegas Loop tunnels are statutorily considered a monorail system, she said. Boring owns the tunnels and operates the Vegas Loop under a franchise agreement with Clark County and City of Las Vegas. But, with the expansion to above-ground transportation using public roadways, they appear to many to be operating more like a transportation network company like Uber or Lyft.
Neal said it raises questions about whether that new hybrid service is being properly taxed by the state: “Do we need to have statutory changes that reflect that new behavior and activities…?”
TNCs, colloquially referred to as rideshare, and taxis are both subject to a 3% excise tax. Taxi and limousine companies have said Boring’s above-ground plans will decimate their industry.
Nevada Transportation Authority Chair Vaughn Hartung told lawmakers the Vegas Loop vehicles cannot be classified as TNCs because passengers are not connected to their rides through a digital network, which is part of the state’s definition of a TNC. It also cannot be classified as a taxi because they don’t use meters.
“So, it is classified for us the same as we would classify a limousine,” he said.
State lawmakers wanted to further question Hartung and his staff about the classification of the above-ground operations of the Vegas Loop, but the agency’s administrative attorney Yoneet Wilburn intervened to advise they could not answer such questions because of pending litigation.
The Livery Operator’s Association of Las Vegas in November filed a petition for judicial review, asking a district court to review the Nevada Transportation Authority’s decision to give Vegas Loop the greenlight to provide above-ground transportation.
“We need to fully adjudicate that court process,” said Wilburn. “These questions are getting into the application process and the hearing and how we decided.”
Wilburn told lawmakers a hearing is expected in the next few weeks.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/lvcvatunnel-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-22 08:37:04.784322

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Amid ongoing tensions between the Utah Legislature and the state’s judiciary, a lawmaker wants to ask voters to give the Legislature the power to call a “special retention election” if legislators decide that a judge is “unfit or incompetent.” 
Rep. Walt Brooks, R-St. George, is sponsoring HJR13. If the Legislature passes that resolution for the 2026 November ballot and a majority of voters approve it, the Utah Constitution would be changed to grant lawmakers the authority to put judges up for retention elections sooner than their regular six-year terms if the full Legislature decides that a judge is:

Unfit or incompetent
Persistently fails to make timely decisions in a case
Has engaged in conduct that violates the judge’s oath of office
Acts improper or creates an appearance of impropriety 

If the Legislature determines a judge has done any of those things, the proposed constitutional amendment would allow the Legislature to “initiate a process for the judge to be subject to a special retention election as soon as practicable,” according to the resolution. 
The Legislature would be able to call that special retention election “even if the judge could be liable to impeachment” or subject to investigation under current Utah law. The Legislature would also be required to set a state law to dictate the “manner and timing” of that special election. 
A judge subjected to a special election called by the Legislature would still also need to go through their regular, six-year retention election — except if the special election occurs in the same year as the regular one. 
If voters approve the proposed constitutional amendment, it would take effect in January 2027. 
Utah chief justice delivers letter to lawmakers to oppose bill threatening judicial independence

The proposed amendment comes during a session where lawmakers are expected to debate several pieces of legislation aimed at making changes to the judiciary as Republican lawmakers continue to be frustrated by the judicial branch. They’ve criticized the courts of being too slow to make decisions, while also vehemently disagreeing with several recent rulings. 
In the state’s redistricting lawsuit in particular, 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson has faced accusations from lawmakers claiming she’s an “activist” judge, and at least one lawmaker has previously said he wanted to seek articles of impeachment against her — though he’s since paused that effort while the Legislature appeals her court-ordered congressional map to the Utah Supreme Court. 
Top Republican legislative leaders have also criticized the timing of Gibson’s redistricting rulings, saying they’ve left little to no time for lawmakers to appeal before the 2026 elections. 
But Brooks, in an interview with Utah News Dispatch on Tuesday, said his bill isn’t meant to target any one specific judge, including Gibson — though he did say he does have his “gripes” with her. 
“That’s not what this is about,” he said. “Honestly, the judicial branch should be taking care of this. … But there are some judges that are just not doing their job. They have a backlog a mile long.” 
Brooks said the current judicial retention election required by the Utah Constitution leaves too much time before voters can hold a problematic judge accountable, and he said he wants to empower voters to have more of a “voice” when it comes to the judiciary. 
“Six years is too long,” he said. “If someone’s derelict in their duties, and it’s, in this case, extremely negligent … then I think the people have the right to say, ‘Hey, we don’t want to retain this judge because they’re not servicing us, the people.’” 
‘Fundamentally unfair’
In response to a request for comment Wednesday, the state’s judiciary (which rarely weighs in on legislation) said it didn’t have a comment to share on Brooks’ proposed constitutional amendment.

The Utah State Bar also hasn’t taken a position on the proposal, but the Bar’s president, Kim Cordova, told Utah News Dispatch on Wednesday morning that she has concerns with Brooks’ proposed constitutional amendment because it includes “broad” and “subjective” language lawmakers could use to target judges. 
“It’s also a separation of powers issue,” Cordova said. “We have three separate branches of government, and the Legislature should not be the enforcers of a different branch of government.” 
What behavior could fall under the definition of “unfit or incompetent,” Cordova questioned, along with conduct that is “improper or creates an appearance of impropriety?”
Cordova said judges are already accountable in a variety of ways — to voters every six years, and to the review body called the Judicial Performance Evaluation Commission, which provides nonpartisan information to voters regarding how judges score on factors including legal ability, integrity and judicial temperament, and administrative skills. 
Any proposed amendment to the Utah Constitution should “really have the highest level of scrutiny,” Cordova added.
“Any changes should be serious in terms of subject matter, and everything that’s in (Brooks’ proposal) can be addressed appropriately in another manner,” she said. 
She also noted it would put judges targeted by the Legislature in a compromising position because they can’t campaign or defend themselves in the public arena. 
“Judges don’t run. They stay completely silent,” Cordova said. “So it’s so fundamentally unfair (to call a special retention election on) a judge when they can’t really respond. … They can’t do anything except put their heads down and do their job. And that’s what they do.”

Lawmakers, governor weigh in 
Democrats including Rep. Doug Owens, D-Millcreek, and Sen. Stephanie Pitcher, D-Salt Lake City, expressed concerns with Brooks’ proposal, saying it could be used to target Gibson or other judges the Legislature doesn’t like or agree with. 
“What we’re proposing through Brooks’ bill goes way beyond … it gives the Legislature broad authority to apparently hold an election and pick on any judge for whatever reason that they have an issue,” Pitcher said. “I find it incredibly problematic from a constitutional perspective, from a separation of powers (perspective).” 
Pitcher also added it’s another legislative proposal among many this year that seem “retaliatory” against the judicial branch because Republican lawmakers are angry about past rulings checking their power. 
“They continue to put forward bills that undermine or unconstitutionally take away power from that branch of government,” she said. 
Owens said Brooks’ proposal also does nothing to address the real problem facing the judicial branch, which is an overwhelmed and underfunded district court. 
“Our judges are overworked. They don’t have enough clerks to help. You know, we could fund the judiciary better,” Owens said, while also arguing that Utah’s court system is “extremely highly regarded.” 
Tuesday, on the first day of lawmakers’ 45-day session, Utah Supreme Court Chief Justice Matthew Durrant told lawmakers in his State of the Judiciary address that the biggest need for more funding and judges is in the district courts — which he said have been operating in “triage mode” to handle their heavy workload. 
Utah Legislature kicks off 1st day of 2026 session with calls to focus on people, cost of living

It remains to be seen whether Brooks’ proposed constitutional amendment will gain traction. 
Powerful legislative leaders including House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, and Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and Gov. Spencer Cox have all expressed support for another bill to expand the Utah Supreme Court from five seats to seven, while also expanding lower courts. 
Schultz has highlighted “huge concerns” he’s had with at least two judges, including 7th District Judge Don Torgerson — who twice referred to a defendant’s “privilege” while deciding to not require him to serve any additional jail time or pay a fine for possessing and distributing multiple images of children being raped and sexually abused, KSL TV reported — and 3rd District Judge William Kendall, who resigned after accusations of sexual abuse and sharing a “weed pen,” according to KSL.com. 
Schultz, in a media availability with reporters Tuesday, said lawmakers will do “something” related to Torgerson during their 2026 session, but what they’ll do is “to be determined.” 
Asked about Brooks’ proposal and if it’s aimed at Gibson, Schultz told reporters, “I don’t know that (it’s) necessarily aimed at one particular issue or not.” 
“I think it’s fair to say there’s a lot of concerns out there with the judiciary right now,” Schultz said, emphasizing he wants to require the judicial branch to increase “transparency” around their decision-making while also balancing the independence of each branch of government. 
“We want to do so collaboratively with the judicial branch, we’re hoping that they’re willing to work together with us on these things,” Schultz said. “But we’ll see.”

In an interview with Utah News Dispatch on Tuesday, Cox said he hadn’t yet read Brooks’ proposal, but he questioned whether it’s necessary. 
“The Legislature does have the ability to remove a judge now,” Cox said, through impeachment. “I’m not sure why we would need something different than that. We do have retention elections, and I believe in the judiciary, even when I disagree with the judge. And I disagree passionately with (Gibson) in this case, but I think there should be a different standard for impeachment versus a standard where we disagree with someone.” 
Cox also added — while talking more broadly about lawmakers’ focus on judicial legislation this year — that lawmakers have been “working on judiciary reform for several years now.” 
“We’ve passed several bills, and they’re working, but the Legislature sometimes doesn’t have the patience to allow the things that they’ve actually done to play out, and so we’re maybe trying to fix a problem that we’ve already fixed,” Cox said. “So I like to give legislation a chance to work and then see where we are.” 
Proposed constitutional amendments in Utah need to pass the Legislature with a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate. It wouldn’t need the governor’s signature to go on the ballot.

Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, said during the House Education Policy Committee meeting she was glad the bill is being brought up.
“Rep. [Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile,] and I serve on a Women’s Commission that had a study done the year before last on the danger of not only children using screen time, but of their parents using screen time instead of looking at the children and talking and singing. And so I think this is very important,” she said.
Under the Alabama Administrative Code, children under two in child care facilities are prohibited from screen usage while children over two are limited to 30 minutes per day for children in half-day programs and less than an hour for children in licensed child care facilities.
Ross’ bill would expand the limitations to 90 minutes per day for children ages two through four and prohibit individual screen usage. The bill would also require local boards of education to set guidelines for appropriate screen usage in kindergarten classes.
Jaime McKinney, a pediatrician at the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s School of Medicine and Children’s of Alabama, said in December that research shows that “excessive” screen time can have negative effects on children.
“Kids who have early exposure to screen time, have speech deficits, have some problems with attention, whether that’s inattentiveness, trouble focusing, even some aggression in anger concerns,” she said. “There’s been issues in regards to sleep, whether that’s a child’s ability to wind down, or their ability to even sleep when there’s a screen present or like a TV in the room given the blue light.”
Under the bill, guidelines for proper screen usage would be created by ADECE in collaboration with the Department of Human Resources (DHR) and the Alabama State Department of Education. All three agencies would also create training required for certain teachers and staff.
No members of the committee spoke against the bill.

(Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest photo)Snowpack in Nevada is off to a grim start as high temperatures have prevented snow packs from forming, despite high precipitation.
Snowpack in Nevada and the Eastern Sierra – a major source of water for the Truckee River in northern Nevada – are below normal at 74% of median for the time of year. While precipitation in December was well above normal, warmer than normal temperatures mean that has not translated to robust snowpacks throughout much of the state.
Most of Nevada’s water supply starts as snowfall that accumulates in the mountains during the winter before melting in the spring, meaning substandard snowpacks can leave the state with a weak water supply.
Northern and Eastern Nevada were the hardest hit by the snow drought in December, according to the U.S. Department of Agricultural Natural Resources Conservation Service’s winter outlook report. Snowpack in the Upper and Lower Humboldt River Basin – major sources of water for Elko County – is about 28% of median, a significant decrease from early-December when snowpack in the region was 96% of median.
Snowpack in several basins that feed into the Truckee River also experienced a reduction in snow water equivalent in January, but remained near or above the median for the time of year.
The decrease in snowpack across Nevada was largely a result of above normal temperatures melting snowpack away, according to Nevada State Climatologist Baker Perry.
Elko, for example, experienced its warmest December on record. Above normal temperatures prevailed throughout nearly the entire month of December, with Reno and Las Vegas also observing their warmest December on record.
Warmer temperatures also prevented snowpack from forming, despite precipitation in December reaching 151% of median throughout Nevada, well above normal. 
Since October, the Spring Mountains in Southern Nevada have received more than 250% of median precipitation, but above freezing temperatures has resulted in below average snow pack for the time of year.
“December was exceptionally warm and there was really limited snow that was able to build up because whatever precipitation was falling, at least until the end of December, was mainly rain,” Perry said.
Across the West, persistently above-normal temperatures resulted in the warmest December on record. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, nine of the Western states measured their warmest December on record in 131 years.
Warmer temperatures have also impacted snowpack formation in western states at the head of the Colorado River, which provides the majority of southern Nevada’s water.
Snowpack in the Upper Basin of the Colorado River — the largest source of water for Lake Mead — is currently at about 72% of normal for the time of year. While the Upper Colorado River Basin has received average precipitation for the time of year, warm temperatures have prevented more snowpack accumulation.
Snow melt from the Upper Colorado River Basin eventually feeds into Lake Mead, making low snowpack a troubling sign for the reservoir.
Lake Mead is currently only a third full, while Lake Powell is even lower at 27% full. Lake Powell’s water levels directly affect Lake Mead because streamflow to Lake Powell is eventually released to Lake Mead.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which releases updated two-year projections every month, streamflow forecasts show that under current conditions the Colorado River is expected to deliver only 57% of normal flow into Lake Powell. 
Those same projections show that Lake Mead will likely be 3-5 feet lower this summer compared to last year. 
Lake Mead is also projected to reach 1,040 feet in August 2027, which would place southern Nevada in a Tier 2 water shortage in 2027, triggering automatic reductions in allocations.
While those projections look grim, it is still very early in the winter season. Snowpacks typically continue to build through March, meaning there are still three months of snow accumulation left.
Nevada has already seen heavy fluctuations in the last few months. In early-December, the Sierra basins had record low snow water amounts, but multiple feet of snowfall over Christmas boosted snow water back to near normal.
Above normal rainfall in December has also helped alleviate drought in the West. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, drought coverage in the 11-state Western region stood at just under 35% in early January, down from 66% as recently as late-September.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ruby-mountains-snowy-tho-1024x578.jpg,,,2026-01-22 08:37:04.784322

The Education Department, in a court filing Wednesday, moved to dismiss its appeal. It leaves in place a federal judge’s August decision finding that the anti-DEI effort violated the First Amendment and federal procedural rules.
The dispute centered on federal guidance telling schools and colleges they would lose federal money if they kept a wide range of practices that the Republican administration labeled as diversity, equity and inclusion.
The department did not immediately comment.
Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy firm representing the plaintiffs, said the dismissal was “a welcome relief and a meaningful win for public education.”
“Today’s dismissal confirms what the data shows: government attorneys are having an increasingly difficult time defending the lawlessness of the president and his cabinet,” said Skye Perryman, the group’s president and CEO.
The department sent the anti-DEI warning in a “Dear Colleague Letter” to schools last February.
The memo said race could not be considered in decisions involving college admissions, hiring, scholarships and “all other aspects of student, academic, and campus life.” It said efforts to increase diversity had led to discrimination against white and Asian American students.
The department later asked K-12 schools to certify they did not practice DEI, again threatening to cut federal funding.
Both documents were struck down by U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland. In her ruling, she said the guidance stifled teachers’ free speech, “causing millions of educators to reasonably fear that their lawful, and even beneficial, speech might cause them or their schools to be punished.”

Critics said the legislation could lead to harassment of immigrants and constitutional violations.

HB 13, sponsored by Rep. Ernie Yarbrough, R-Trinity, would permit local law enforcement to enter into memorandum of understanding or agreements with federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security to help enforce the country’s immigration laws.
“This is to help with the flooding, particularly with criminal elements, into our country over the last several years,” Yarbrough told the committee about his bill. “We feel like that grass roots help to work together with the federal government on existing laws will help make our communities more safe.”

Several speakers expressed concerns that the bill could allow law enforcement to violate people’s constitutional rights, and said it could create fear among immigrants that they could be stopped, detained and eventually deported by law enforcement while out in public.
“We are concerned about it on a number of levels,” said Rev. Kevin Thomas, senior pastor at First Church Birmingham, in an interview with media after the meeting. “Number one; how do you determine probable cause? Number two; a law enforcement officer who gets it wrong is immune from prosecution under this bill. To allow officers to do what they do with impunity is concerning to us. As parents of a law enforcement officer, not in Alabama, we could imagine this affecting him at some point too.”
The bill comes as the deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Minnesota has led to massive resistance. Allison Hamilton, executive director of the Alabama Coalition of Immigrant Justice, told the committee that ICE agents have used tear gas on individuals and families and arrested multiple people who are U.S. citizens even after they presented identification.
“One citizen in Alabama has been detained twice this year while working on construction sites and was accused of having a fake star ID both times,” Hamilton said. “We are in a very dangerous moment when a federal agency is being used to silence American people.”
Current statute only allows the Alabama Attorney General’s Office to enter into agreements with the federal government. The legislation allows law enforcement agencies to detain, remove and investigate individuals without the required paperwork to remain in the country.
It is unclear how the bill is different from the 287(g) program that also allows the federal government to obtain help from state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration. Some agencies in Alabama already have such agreements in place.
Yarbrough’s legislation requires state and local government employees to share and maintain information about the immigration status of individuals and transfer the custody of such individuals to the custody of the federal government. The legislation also allows state and local law enforcement to arrest people based on their immigration status.
HB 13 states that staff must try to determine the legal status of individuals who are arrested and contact the Law Enforcement Support Center of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to determine a person’s legal residency status if the individual is unable to provide paperwork to prove legal status.
The bill also states that people without the proper paperwork to reside in the U.S. cannot be detained without specific written instructions from ICE or LESC.
Yarbrough previously filed the bill in 2024 and 2025. Both the House Judiciary and the Public Safety and Homeland Security committees approved the legislation in 2025, but it did not come to a broader vote.
Lawmakers last year passed SB 53, sponsored by Wes Kitchens, R-Arab, that makes it a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine to transport individuals who do not have appropriate documentation into Alabama from another country or state.
That bill also required county and municipal jail staff to investigate the residency status of people in their custody, like HB 13.
Thomas was especially concerned with specific provisions in the legislation, such as allowing law enforcement to “arrest, with probable cause, any individual suspected of being an illegal alien.”
“It enables those officers to arrest and detain someone on probable cause of being an undocumented immigrant,” Thomas told the committee. “It doesn’t define what that probable cause looks like, and I am curious if my daughter’s skin color is probable cause for her detention, or if she is hanging out with the wrong group of people.”
Thomas said earlier that he and his spouse adopted their daughter from Guatemala who is afraid to drive and be out in public because of the scrutiny she may be subjected to by ICE and local and state law enforcement.
Several lawmakers with prior law enforcement experience praised the actions of sheriffs’ deputies and police officers charged with protecting the public.
“As a 34-year law enforcement officer, let me tell you what I see,” said Rep. Shane Stringer, R-Citronelle, during the committee meeting. “I have seen the cops take care of our community and care for people that have a love for people. Personally, I have allowed an immigrant from Honduras that was in our community with nowhere to go, to stay in a camper until he had somewhere to go.”
Other lawmakers on the committee said that people have a right to be concerned with the legislation.
“I don’t think it is unreasonable for people to think, or to be afraid, that their ethnicity can be weaponized, or used against them, by somebody who is untrained, who is unhinged, and who has absolutely no business being in law enforcement,” said Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa. “I don’t think it is unreasonable for people to have a certain level of fear if they have experienced some things in their past.”

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector) A House committee Wednesday passed a bill that would require public higher education institutions to report state and federal funds received and spent.
HB 165, sponsored by Rep. Danny Garrett, R-Trussville, requires public colleges and universities to file an annual report detailing state and federal funds the institutions received and spent in the previous fiscal year. 
“We’re not sure when tough times are coming. They already hit the General Fund. Things have leveled out with us. And the point here is that we want to make sure that these institutions are prepared and have backup contingency plans,” Garrett told members of the House Ways and Means Education Committee Wednesday.

Last week, Gov. Kay Ivey gave her proposed budget to the Alabama Legislature. The proposed Education Trust Fund budget includes a $570 million (5.8%) increase over this year, but most of that will go to salary increases for education employees and a $210 million increase for Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Plan (PEEHIP). Most programs will be funded at current levels. Ivey’s proposed General Fund budget had about $28.5 million (0.8%) in cuts.
Kirk Fulford, legislative fiscal officer, told legislators last week the reason for a conservative budget is because of an anticipated 2028.
“There’s other things that you’re going to be forced to assume liability on,” Fulford said. “There’s going to be a rock fight in 2028. Keep your head down, and watch where it goes, but it’s going to be a tough one.”
Garrett said Wednesday the bill would also require public colleges and universities to have a plan in place in case of an emergency.
“The state of Alabama is heavily dependent upon federal dollars. A lot of people don’t really realize that even the money that we appropriate for the four-year institutions is just a small portion of what they receive from the federal government” he said. “So this is just basically trying to get ahead and avoid a crisis by having institutions think ahead and let us keep us informed on the amount of federal assistance they receive.”
The New York Times reported last year that roughly $60 billion in federal funds went to universities across the country to fund research topics including cancer and Alzheimer’s disease in 2023. That funding has been threatened by cuts from the Trump administration. 
Jim Purcell, executive director for the Alabama Commission on Higher Education (ACHE), said in a statement Wednesday that the organization is already required to submit an annual budget recommendation for colleges and universities and that loss of funding is a concern.
“The reduction of federal support, especially the reduction of indirect funding, was a common concern for institutions when presenting their budget proposal at this year’s Commission of Higher Education Finance Committee hearing,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_9365-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-22 07:37:52.020996

(Photo by Tom Banse)Washington State Ferries is taking a hard look at a pitch from a shipyard owner to refurbish two of the state’s deteriorated retired ferries and return them to service under a long-term lease. 
The novel idea is bound to intrigue ferry riders who have endured a rash of trip cancellations to begin this year, caused by vessel breakdowns and the absence of any reserve ferryboats. But the sorry condition of the decommissioned ferries brings a raft of uncertainties, both practical and financial. 
Seattle-based Stabbert Maritime first approached ferry system leaders in October with this proposal. Emails obtained by the Washington State Standard through a public records request outlined the basic idea and ongoing consideration.
Stabbert wants to acquire the retired 144-car ferry Hyak as well as the 87-car ferry Klahowya. The owner of shipyards in Seattle and Anacortes would refurbish those diesel ferries on its own dime and then recoup its investment by leasing the vessels back to the ferry system for perhaps 15 years.
Vice president for business development for Stabbert Maritime, Bryan Nichols, told the ferry system that adding leased vessels could bring relief in the near to medium term before the state’s newly-ordered hybrid electric ferries launch beginning in 2030.
“This extra capacity would help ensure reliable service for the public while supporting needed fleet preservation until all of the WSF’s new 160 auto ferries can be delivered,” Nichols wrote in his introductory letter to the head of the ferry system, Steve Nevey.
Nevey’s deputy, John Vezina, said agency representatives would meet with Stabbert’s team in the coming days to dive into the tricky details of how this could work.
“It’s an interesting proposal,” Vezina said in an interview Monday. “We have to do due diligence.”
Vezina said around three or four years ago, the ferry system itself looked at bringing one of its decommissioned ferries out of retirement, but decided against it. The Super-class ferry Hyak is now 59 years old. The Evergreen State-class Klahowya is nearly a decade older. It was built in 1958.
Stabbert’s folks have toured the old boats at their moorings in Eagle Harbor on Bainbridge Island. The prospective buyers also received inspection reports by an independent marine surveyor that rated both vessels as structurally sound, but in “fair to poor” overall condition.

Dollars, sense and seaworthiness
The two retired ferries are presently inoperable. Over the years, ferry system mechanics have stripped key parts for re-use on other boats. The navigation gear, radars, radios and lifeboats are all gone. Even the Hyak’s horn was removed and reinstalled in Climate Pledge Arena as the goal horn for Seattle Kraken hockey games. 
Stabbert Maritime CEO Dan Stabbert said the missing equipment needed to be modernized anyway. He said his company’s long experience doing “life renewals” of large workboats used, for example, in the offshore oil and gas industry gives him confidence the state’s castoff ferries could be revived.
“When we walked on the vessels, we saw tremendous potential,” Stabbert said in an interview Wednesday. “With new technology installations, you could have a very reliable 20-plus year life renewal.” 
Vezina estimated it would be extremely costly – “tens of millions of dollars,” he gauged – to make either retired ferry seaworthy again. Stabbert said his team needs to do more in-depth investigation to arrive at its own estimate of restoration costs and how that would translate into a leaseback price to the ferry system.
“There may be a blend where we can provide an asset for a reasonable price point that is compatible with their newbuild program and the additional needs that exist,” Dan Stabbert said.
If the restoration-leaseback proposal proves to be unworkable or unaffordable, Stabbert said his shipyards are prepared to recycle both vessels for the state at cost.
Scrapper alternative
The state ferry system formalized the disposition process for the Hyak and Klahowya in December after a word-of-mouth sales campaign over the past four years failed to secure a successful buyer. The new plan entailed an open solicitation of proposals to repurpose, recycle or refurbish and lease back one or both of the retired ferries.
Besides Stabbert Maritime, one other company responded to the solicitation. Global Diving & Salvage of Seattle said it could responsibly recycle the decommissioned ferries for a to-be-determined price. This was an unexpected local alternative that Vezina said the ferry system was excited to receive. Until now, the operating assumption was that scrapping a surplus ferry would necessitate a million-dollar tow to a faraway shipbreaking yard in Texas or beyond.
Vezina said whichever course the ferry system favors will just be a recommendation to the ultimate decisionmakers: Gov. Bob Ferguson and the state Legislature. That is because lawmakers would need to scrape together money not presently budgeted.
Stabbert said his firm’s proposed ferry refurbishments could take less than two years to complete once contracts were in place. 
Decisionmakers harbor skepticism
Legislators will have to be convinced to undo the deliberate decisions in 2017 and 2019 to retire the aging Klahowya and Hyak, respectively. 
Back in 2019, the ferry system and then-Gov. Jay Inslee proposed what now looks like a relatively modest sum of $6.3 million to maintain the Hyak in operable condition. But legislators took a position that will sound familiar to many owners of old cars. They foresaw ever-rising repair bills for a deteriorating jalopy and figured the taxpayers’ money would be better spent on a downpayment for a new vehicle.
Then as now, state Rep. Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, chaired the House Transportation Committee. Fey said he is open to taking another look while at the same time considering other ideas to make ferry service more reliable.

“I look forward to hearing if that is feasible,” Fey said regarding the leaseback idea, which was new to him.
Fey’s Senate counterpart is treating the leaseback pitch with caution.
“I have concerns that there is not an ROI on that,” Senate Transportation Chair Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, said in a brief interview, using shorthand for return on investment.
Interestingly, Stabbert Maritime is not the only company pitching a ferry lease to Washington state policymakers. A San Francisco-based startup named Switch Maritime recently hired an Olympia lobbyist to promote its line of zero-emission hydrogen-powered ferries and to ask lawmakers to authorize leasing for new vessel acquisition.
“The lease structure is a capital efficient means for WSF to introduce new vessels without allocating the full capital expense upfront,” said Switch’s director of commercial and government affairs, Seamus Nolan, via email. “Leasing also allows WSF to partner with an experienced builder/developer to design, build, commission, and bring novel technologies into operation, enabling WSF to focus on delivering quality, reliable ferry service.”
Fey said the Switch pitch is focused on serving the San Juan Islands. The ferry leasing company was also in line for a grant to support vessel construction through the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, but that went away last year when the Trump administration canceled the clean energy program’s federal funding.
A frequent ferry rider who follows policy developments closely from Orcas Island said the leasing proposals raised his eyebrows “in a positive way.”
“I’m all for giving it a really good hearing,” San Juan County Councilmember Justin Paulsen said. 
Paulsen said just last month he personally experienced the “acute” impacts of ferry schedule unreliability. He was nearly stranded on the mainland when the ferry system canceled his evening reservation to travel home. This happened after the aging ferry Kaleetan was abruptly sidelined by a blown engine cylinder. That left the final departure of the day to Orcas on another vessel overbooked. Paulsen said he left his car behind in Anacortes and walked on the late ferry to get home.
“We are at a point where we have to really do some creative thinking,” was Paulsen’s takeaway. “We need to progress forward in a faster way.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Hyak-in-Kingston-1024x686.jpg,,,2026-01-22 07:37:52.020996

A bill under consideration in the state Senate seeks to reverse that.
Last year, Washington lawmakers slashed funding across the board to help close the state’s multibillion-dollar budget deficit. In higher education, the state cut a portion of the Washington College Grant, the state-funded tuition assistance program for students from low to middle-income families.
For students attending public universities, the grant covers full tuition. But for students attending private universities like Gonzaga or Pacific Lutheran University, the state pays a flat amount for tuition, about $9,700 a year. After the cuts, it would be reduced to around $6,500. State funding for tuition at public universities will remain the same.  
“Students should be able to make decisions about where to pursue their education without facing unnecessary uncertainty about the support they will receive,” said Sen. T’wina Nobles, D-Fircrest, prime sponsor of the bill.
The “inequitable” cuts are “breaking a promise to students who have been on the road to college since middle school,” Terri Standish-Kuon, president and chief executive officer of the Independent Colleges of Washington, said in a committee hearing last week.
Another program, the Washington College Bound Scholarship, typically provides around $13,000 a year to students attending private institutions. With last year’s cuts, that amount will be reduced to $6,800. Nobles’ bill would restore that funding as well. Students can be accepted into the scholarship program as early as sixth grade.
Two-thirds of students attending independent private, not-for-profit universities are students of color, 65% identify as female and 62% will be the first in their family to earn a degree, according to data from the Independent Colleges of Washington. Two in three of these students are pursuing degrees in high-demand fields.
Restoring the Washington College Grant aid for students attending private schools will cost the state nearly $34 million over the next two fiscal years. 
All but two of the 25 people who testified at last week’s hearing supported adding the funding back. 
Representatives from the state’s public universities are opposed. 
“Unfortunately, there is no bill yet seeking to restore funding cuts to the state’s own universities, whose very purpose is to serve the state,” said Sam Ligon, Eastern Washington University legislative liaison. “It may be naive to believe the states should restore funding to its own institutions first, but that’s my hope.”
Ligon said that public universities are suffering from “hidden cuts” the Legislature took out from the public universities’ general funding budget. 
Because of this and other cuts, all six of Washington’s public colleges and universities are in multimillion-dollar budget deficits, said Melissa Beard, director of legislative affairs for the Council for Presidents, an association that represents the schools.  
“Before we restore this for the privates, let’s restore at least a portion of the tens of millions that were cut out of the public,” Ligon said. 
All told, 3,009 people signed in to support the bill during last week’s hearing, and 23 opposed it. The bill is scheduled for a possible vote Thursday in the Senate Higher Education and Workforce Development Committee.
The House version of the legislation has not been scheduled for a hearing.
Lawmakers are still grappling with a financial shortfall this year, and more cuts are expected.
House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, said it’s too early to know whether funding for the proposal will end up in the final budget, but that her alma mater, the University of Puget Sound, “makes a very good case.”
“We’re in a deficit position looking at reductions to a lot of things, trying to save all we can,” Jinkins said. “There are many really good causes and we’re not going to be able to fund them all.”
Diamond Casiano-Reyes, a student at Pacific Lutheran University, told lawmakers in testimony last week that, as a first-generation Hispanic student who comes from low-income parents, it is unrealistic and difficult to acquire a large amount of money to go to university. The state’s financial aid programs made it possible, Casiano-Reyes said.
“It brought me great fear not knowing if I’ll be able to accomplish my dream of becoming a nurse,” Casiano-Reyes said. “I urge you to schedule a vote on bill 5828 and pass it out of committee.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/college-graduate-1024x681.jpg,,,2026-01-22 07:37:52.020996

Activists called on airport officials to halt the flights by ICE out of Willow Run Airport near Ypsilanti during the public comment period of the Wayne County Airport Authority board meeting on Wednesday.
According to the ICE Flight Monitor, a project by the organization Human Rights First, ICE used Willow Run as a stop for flights, usually to major immigration detention hubs in the South, regularly throughout the second half of 2025.
Steve Conn, an activist with the Detroit Committee to Stop ICE, called the airport “a key link in the chain, down to Texas or Louisiana overnight” during the public board meeting. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Chad Newton, the Chief Executive Officer of the Wayne County Airport Authority, said in his report to the board during the meeting that he is often asked if the airport authority has any contracts with ICE. 
“Our response remains, the Wayne County Airport Authority does not have any involvement in the agreements between airlines and their partners, including federal agencies, as long as those agreements meet legal and safety requirements,” he said. 
But many present did not find Newton’s argument about the authority’s lack of responsibility convincing, arguing that no activity takes place at an airport without approval and urging those in attendance to use their power to stop such activity and make it more difficult for it to continue.
George Washington, a lawyer in the Detroit area, similarly said that, while the board may not have made the decision to initially permit ICE to use the airport, they should be acting on it now.
“We know that this board did not set up that system that was set up by the Trump administration, but we know also that by allowing Willow Run to do this, you’re collaborating with this system,” he said. “You’re collaborating because you said nothing about it, because even till this day, you will not condemn it. You will simply say it’s not our problem.”

Washington also criticized the board for not mentioning the usage of the airport by ICE during the main portion of the meeting, a significant portion of which focused on upgrades to restrooms in the McNamara terminal. 
Airlines conducting ICE flights out of Willow Run include Colorado-based Key Lime Air, as well as Eastern Air Express. Photos shared with Michigan Advance by the Detroit Committee to Stop ICE, showed people with shackled wrists boarding a plane at Willow Run. Additionally, online records from the Federal Aviation Administration show that the tail number on one of the aircraft seen in the pictures matched up with a plane operated by Eastern Air Express. 
A report by Human Rights First said there were 88 outbound ICE flights from Willow Run in 2025. According to the Detroit Committee to Stop ICE, the planes then usually flew “from Ypsilanti to major immigration detention hubs in the South, such as Alexandria, Louisiana,” where ICE maintains a deportation staging facility operated by the GEO Group. That’s the same corporation which operates the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, Michigan, ICE’s largest detention facility in the Midwest.

Jessi Hanson-DeFusco, an assistant professor of public policy at Lawrence Technological University, also shared the potential risks for airports like Willow Run that are being used by ICE. 
“Anyone who comes through one of our airports who has damages, suffers personal injuries, property damage, or was wrongfully detained, or has medical malpractice, will legally be able to sue any partners or entities, including counties like Wayne County for having taken part in that,” she said. “Are you sure, out of the thousands of people who have come through our airports, that each individual has received due process and was detained legally, lawfully and ethically?”
Conn also urged the broader Wayne County community to protest the use of the airport by ICE, adding that he urged airport employees to shut the airport down if needed. 
“You must act. You must do everything you can, and you can do so much,” he said. “When this is such an injustice and so critical to the future of our country, we must take action. We must do everything we can.”

(Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer)Four years ago this week, FBI agents raided dozens of sites all over the Twin Cities metro, collecting evidence that dozens of people were falsely claiming to feed hungry children and fraudulently collecting millions of dollars in taxpayer money.
The investigation has led to 78 indictments and nearly 60 convictions, and sprawled well beyond its namesake, Feeding Our Future, which is the nonprofit at the center of the scheme. 
Investigative journalists and law enforcement discovered that some of the child meal fraudsters were also in the child autism business, while others were collecting money to (not) provide housing stability for the homeless. The state has identified 14 Medicaid programs at risk of significant fraud and instituted an anti-fraud protocol that’s delaying critical funding from some legitimate providers and their vulnerable clients. As predicted, the fraud is undermining support for public programs that had helped make Minnesota an island of social democracy in the Upper Midwest.  
The image of leading Democrats like Gov. Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison has been tarnished by the scandal. More important: My entire community is now under siege because of the actions of the fraudsters – and the politicians who looked the other way.
In short, Feeding Our Future has upended the state’s social service programs and its politics. 
We’d do well to learn some lessons: 

 It’s bigger than you know, and some people are likely going to walk. 


The Reformer reviewed Minnesota Department of Education data for meal sites that claimed to have served at least $1 million from the two main federal programs that were fleeced between 2020 and 2021. Prosecutors have charged defendants associated with roughly half of those 126 meal sites. In other words, people associated with fully half of the sites in which MDE paid out at least $1 million have thus far escaped charges. 
Among the notable institutions and people who participated in the meals program but have not been charged: a nonprofit founded by a well-known athlete, houses of worship, the wife of a politician. There’s no evident indication that they are being investigated by federal law enforcement or that charges are forthcoming, so the Reformer isn’t naming them.
The lead federal prosecutor on the case, Joseph Thompson, has resigned, joined by other key attorneys on the case, which doesn’t bode well for more Feeding Our Future charges. The case may be winding down, but the ramifications will be with us for many years.  

 Government officials suffered from a failure of imagination. 


When the Reformer asked the Department of Human Services in 2023 whether Feeding Our Future defendants had any contracts with the agency, DHS — after stonewalling for months — gave a curious response: Half the people indicted in the federal Feeding Our Future case, DHS said, “have no record of working in current DHS-funded services.” Meaning, the other half, at some point, received other state contracts.

This should have been a serious wakeup call to DHS. The thieves were in the building. If they examined the Feeding Our Future cases closely, they’d see the scale and brazenness of the theft — people set up entire companies with the sole purpose of stealing from the public. 
DHS should have known that if the fraudsters were doing it with Feeding Our Future, they would do the same with DHS programs, especially programs with low barriers to entry. Until the Legislature finally acted, for instance, you didn’t need a license to be an autism services provider. That’s how you get a 3,000% increase in spending in five years. 

 Elected and government officials suffered from a failure of nerve. 


Let’s recall the political moment: George Floyd had been murdered by Minneapolis police not two years prior, and Minnesota’s business and political establishment was publicly agonizing over the state’s vast disparities in income, education and health between white and Black Minnesotans. 
Feeding Our Future ringleader Aimee Bock, who is white, tried to use the legal system and her strong political network to bully bureaucrats and politicians to keep the money flowing when the Department of Education made a feckless effort to rein it in. She largely succeeded.
State Sen. Omar Fateh, DFL-Minneapolis, said in June 2021 — at a party to celebrate Feeding Our Future’s legal victory over the Department of Education — that their pressure campaign was paying off: “What I can tell you is that leadership hears you. Folks at the Capitol hear you. The pressure is really on, and … it’s working.”
People who work at DHS probably want to help people who need it and never imagined themselves tasked with stamping out widespread fraud in well-intentioned programs. This is understandable, but they failed nonetheless.  
Ryan Pacyga, an attorney who has represented several defendants charged by the U.S. Attorney’s Office, told the New York Times that it was so easy that some defendants were sure the state was tolerating the fraud. “No one was doing anything about the red flags. It was like someone was stealing money from the cookie jar and they kept refilling it.”
Even when DHS referred potential child care fraud to law enforcement, the agency balked when it came time to help the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, according to a recent KARE 11 report. 
The problem with finding fraud is that when you find it, you have to confront it, which would be a serious headache for Democrats and their allies in the Somali community. 

 Without a largely apolitical Minnesota Office of U.S. Attorney, the fraud would have gone on unabated for years. 


The raids occurred during the Biden administration. Then-U.S. Attorney Andy Luger announced the first charges in 2022. The lead prosecutor became the acting U.S. attorney and continued the investigation, taking it in new directions, including Medicaid fraud. This consistency — and a record of piling up convictions — gave the investigation bipartisan credibility and focused the minds of Minnesotans on an issue that needed it. 
Unfortunately, the investigation now risks being badly politicized. It’s unclear who will replace Thompson, but we know right-wing politicians and influencers have become central figures in the fraud issue. That’s likely to polarize the issue and turn Democrats — who are a majority of the state — into skeptics.  

 We Somalis needed mature political leadership from elected officials from our community. 


Unfortunately, we didn’t get that leadership. The first response to the investigation by some newly empowered Somali politicians was to allege discrimination. 
At a June 2021 celebration when Feeding Our Future won a court victory, Minneapolis City Council Member Jamal Osman* crowed that he’d pushed back on state bureaucrats: “I’m one of those people that push back and call it what it is. Which is racist tactics,” Osman said. 
In December 2021, just weeks before the FBI raid, Fateh spoke at the 1st Annual Somali American Elected Officials Town Hall and alleged that the Minnesota education and health departments, as well as DHS, were “consistently targeting” immigrant businesses.
Revelations that more than 90% of the defendants in Feeding Our Future and related Medicaid fraud have Somali origin have been met with silence and defensiveness. Our leaders are right to stand up to the unconstitutional actions of the Trump administration and scoff at the right-wing tourists knocking on our doors, but they should also be urging — even if only privately — our religious, cultural and business leaders to spread the word that our community’s reputation is suffering from the actions of a few and in need of repair. That begins by delivering honest work for honest pay. 
We’re hardly the first group of immigrants to go through this — there’s an entire genre of American cinema about the Italian mob, after all — but the sooner we get it fixed, the sooner we can get back to what we all came here for: the American Dream.

(Stock photo/Getty Images)South Carolina’s General Assembly should consider pausing any more new data centers in our state until protections are passed to protect ratepayers.
Here’s why. There are currently no protections in state law that would prevent our state’s residential, industrial and commercial ratepayers from having to foot the bill for the additional electricity that will be needed to run these data centers around the clock.
The General Assembly should authorize the South Carolina Public Service Commission to create a separate higher electricity rate class designed to make data centers pay a higher rate for their electricity and water services, as the governing board of state-owned Santee Cooper did last year by approving an “experimental” special electricity rate.
This would protect all other ratepayers from having to subsidize the cost of serving data centers. Data centers should also be required to pay for all transmission upgrades that utilities like Dominion, Duke Power and Santee Cooper will have to make to connect new data centers to the electricity grid.
These new data centers have very limited economic value because they produce few new jobs. For this reason, no state or local government financial incentives should be offered.
Data centers also are a threat to our state’s water resources, our agricultural economy and our environmentally sensitive resources like the ACE Basin and other protected areas in our beautiful state.
Other states have already taken legislative action to protect their ratepayers and their land and water resources from these energy hogs that demand government subsidies at the expense of state and local governments. Many of these data centers will never be built. The ones that are built will be outdated in a few years anyway. Many will be abandoned leaving toxic waste behind that will have to be cleaned up at taxpayers’ expense.
Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida is pushing for new regulations to protect Florida’s water resources and environmentally sensitive lands. DeSantis has called for data center restrictions and is pushing Florida’s House Bill 1007 to do just that to protect Florida.
Gov. Henry McMaster has been a champion of protecting our precious natural resources. McMaster recently released a study that could serve as a guide for protecting South Carolina’s water resources. That’s a good first step!
But what’s needed now is legislation that prohibits new data centers from hiding behind confidential agreements in their negotiations with state and local governments in our state.
Transparency and accountability should be mandated with so much at stake.
Virginia’s utility commission has recently approved a new rate class for high load users who will be required to pay 85% for transmission costs and distribution and 60% for new generation costs.
In Georgia, bipartisan bills to regulate data centers include proposals to end a tax perk and pause on construction until February 2027.
The state Department of Environmental Services needs to implement regulations governing the noise and air pollution that data centers will bring. These data centers use industrial cooling systems to cool millions of servers which creates a constant low frequency humming noise.
The Department of Natural Resources should be prepared to monitor noise and air pollution to protect our local communities and environment. Many data centers also utilize backup diesel powered generators that emit particulate matter including nitrogen oxide which also poses risks to public health.
Most data centers have a short lifespan of about 10 to 15 years. Since data centers all contain hazardous substances like lead and mercury, they should be required to post a surety bond to cover the costs of environmental cleanup once they become obsolete or file for bankruptcy. Data centers can also create “heat islands” that can adversely affect public health in our local communities.
Time is of the essence. Without legislation and regulatory changes, our state’s residential, small business and industrial ratepayers are going to see much higher electric bills and water bills coming soon.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AI-infrastructure-1024x767.jpg,,,2026-01-22 07:37:52.020996

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)Donald Trump “is unfit for our nation’s highest office,” JD Vance famously said.
He’s “reprehensible,” the now-vice president said before Trump’s first election, and “an idiot.” 
Trump, he said way back then, may even become “America’s Hitler.” 
Vance was prescient when it came to Trump.
Because the 47th U.S. president has repeatedly shown he’s unfit, most germanely for our purposes: He’s sent a paramilitary force of 3,000 masked, heavily armed agents to terrorize us. Agents have accosted Minnesotans based only on skin color, invaded people’s homes without warrants, beaten – and in two cases shot – people without giving justification for adequate cause. 
The Vance who understood Trump so well a decade ago is apparently a weak man whose lust for power overrode whatever principles he had, if they were ever sincere. 
He disgraced his office by calling Renee Good — who was killed this month by a federal officer — a “deranged leftist” and her actions “classic terrorism.” But in the same press conference he admitted: “I don’t know what was in her heart or what was in her head.”
He’s ever the political chameleon. 
That said, Vance is coming to Minnesota on Thursday for a “roundtable” with local leadership. We’re a welcoming people, so I hope he enjoys the brisk air. 
No doubt his propaganda minister will set him up with someone who will tell him ICE is great and immigrants are terrible, but he should talk to some others. 
Like ChongLy “Scott” Thao, an American who told the Associated Press that masked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents forced their way into his house and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them. They then pushed him at gunpoint out into the street wearing only his undergarments in subfreezing temperatures. 
“I was shaking,” he said. “They didn’t show any warrant; they just broke down the door.”
Minnesota is home to many Hmong families who we welcomed here after the Vietnam War, when they fought for the Americans at great personal risk. 
Or how about this Columbia Heights resident Ramon Menera, another U.S. citizen who said he was detained by U.S. Border Patrol agents Jan. 14 because of his accent. 
His hilarious retort, captured on video: “You have an accent, too!”
Maybe Vance should talk to Nasra Ahmed, 23, also U.S. citizen, born and raised in St. Paul. She was arrested by ICE last week and detained for two days, enduring a racial slur and a stress-induced seizure, according to U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum. Oddly, Ahmed faces no charges. 
He should also talk to Ryan Ecklund, a Woodbury realtor who was lawfully observing ICE when he was arrested and detained for 10 hours. 
Finally, no doubt Vance backs the blue — except when people assault police officers as they storm the U.S. Capitol to try to keep Trump in office, in which case: pardons all around — so he should talk to Mark Bruley, the Brooklyn Park police chief. Bruley said his own off-duty officers have been racially profiled while encountering ICE. “Every person who has had this happen to them is a person of color.” 
Here’s what went down, according to Bruley: 
“When (the officer) became concerned about the rhetoric and the way she was being treated, she pulled out her phone in an attempt to record the incident, the phone was knocked out of her hands, preventing her from recording it,” Bruley said. “The [agents] had their guns drawn during the incident and the officer became so concerned she was forced to identify herself as a Brooklyn Park police officer in hopes of slowing and de-escalating the incident.” 
Second Lady Usha Vance is having a baby. Great! Vance should visit the Mischief Toy Store in St. Paul, where ICE agents — angry at the store’s public anti-ICE posture — showed up with a “notice of inspection,” forcing the store to prove its staff are permitted to work in the U.S., the Pioneer Press reported.
Vance should listen to Minnesotans who can tell him about widespread racial profiling and the routine violation of our constitutional rights, and then he should leave — and take his 3,000 masked hooligans with him.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gettyimages-2255276129-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-22 07:37:52.020996

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)MUNCIE, Ind. — A former Muncie hospital pharmacist is facing multiple felony charges tied to the alleged theft of massive quantities of powerful opioids, but more than a year after his arrest — and even longer since the diversion was discovered — his Indiana pharmacy license remains active, unrestricted and untouched by state regulators.
Christopher Knoth, of Yorktown, was arrested in July 2024 by the IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital Police Department after a hospital audit triggered an investigation and a search warrant that uncovered what police described as “a large quantity of drugs” at his home. 
A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration report obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle identified more than 35,000 vials of hydromorphone and methadone that was stolen. 
The drug thefts — amounting to an average of 500 vials a month — are alleged by hospital officials to have taken place over the course of five years.
IU Health representatives said Knoth was “immediately terminated” after the hospital discovered the diversion in July 2024, but the Delaware County Prosecutor’s Office didn’t file formal charges until August 2025.
Despite being what members of the Indiana Board of Pharmacy called “one of the largest diversions” to ever come before the licensing body, the regulatory side of Knoth’s case has stalled, and pharmacy board members have repeatedly emphasized that they cannot act unless — and until — the state attorney general’s office files an administrative complaint.
That complaint, board members were told last week, remains under investigation more than a year-and-a-half after the diversion was discovered.
Knoth currently faces five felony counts, including Level 3 felony possession of a narcotic drug weighing more than 28 grams; Level 5 felony theft of property valued at more than $50,000; and multiple Level 6 felonies tied to fraud, forgery and unlawful possession of syringes, according to court records.










Man, this guy does not need to have a license.


– Indiana Board of Pharmacy member Steven Anderson


All the while, however, Knoth’s Indiana pharmacy license has remained unmarred. State licensing records show no disciplinary action, litigation or restrictions, meaning Knoth has been free to practice elsewhere.
Knoth’s attorneys did not reply before publication to the Capital Chronicle’s questions or requests for comment, and it’s unclear whether Knoth is currently employed as a pharmacist. He has held a license since 2006.
The state pharmacy board’s most recent meetings — in December and again last week — have drawn repeated concerns over the lapse in action and what they called a “free and clear” license.
“We’re 18 months out from the discovery of the diversion of millions of doses of morphine, millions of doses of hydromorphone … and we have a pharmacist that’s still on the street with an active pharmacist license?” asked board member Steven Anderson during the December meeting. “Man, this guy does not need to have a license.”
Board member Kate Snedeker additionally called the “massive diversion” of drugs “one of the biggest I’ve seen.”
Jason Jablonski, another board member, warned that the scale of the alleged theft alone raises “serious” public safety concerns.
“It’s a staggering amount,” he said, pointing for example to 1.5 million milligrams of Dilaudid, a name brand of hydromorphone, a powerful prescription opioid painkiller. 
“Let that bounce around in your head a little bit. That’s a lot,” Jablonski said. “This is not a small amount of medication. This is a very significant amount of controlled substances.”
A yearslong diversion of drugs
IU Health officials first flagged concerns about Knoth after discovering irregularities in controlled substance transactions originating from the hospital’s main pharmacy, according to a probable cause affidavit filed by hospital police. 
Investigators determined that Knoth was allegedly removing hydromorphone and methadone — both highly regulated opiates — from a controlled substance safe and documenting the drugs as transfers to clinics that either did not exist or did not use those medications.
When police searched Knoth’s home in July 2024, they reported finding empty and full vials equivalent to 94,800 milligrams of hydromorphone and 34,800 milligrams of methadone, along with hospital pharmacy transaction documents, syringes and financial records. Additional packaging for tablets were also found. 
Hospital pharmacy leadership confirmed that the packaging and paperwork recovered from the residence matched Ball Memorial Hospital inventory, according to the affidavit.
Story continues below.

IU Health representatives told the Indiana pharmacy board in December that the diversion started during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for opioids surged in intensive-care units and routine oversight was strained.
Hospital representatives told state regulators that the unusual demand for narcotics among critically ill patients “masked” the diversion and delayed detection.
“Our use of that medication, of hydromorphone, was extremely high — much higher than normal — because almost every person that was in our ICUs was on a high amount of that,” said Kimberly Kuznik, a director of pharmacy services for IU Health.
“I think it’s like a Swiss cheese-type thing,” she added. “Our usage was high because our usage was supposed to be high, and that’s when (the drug theft) started, and then it continued.”
The scale of the diversion, once uncovered, triggered a federally required drug theft report to the DEA. A copy of the report does not name Knoth, but details match the location, timeframe, reporting officer and quantities of stolen drugs described in the criminal case.
IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital officials declined to answer questions from the Capital Chronicle, saying only that the hospital “cannot comment on pending investigations,” but is “cooperating fully in a thorough investigation of the situation.”
The DEA report said since the discovery, several precautions have been put into place. The hospital is now running sale, compounding and prescription reports every day. The pharmacist in charge is also running comparison reports at the end of each shift and all reports now must have two signatures every day.
A Delaware County court hearing in the criminal case was originally scheduled for Wednesday but was pushed back until March 11.
‘Free and clear’ pharmacy license
Despite the allegations laid out in Knoth’s criminal case, the Indiana Board of Pharmacy has not taken disciplinary action. Board members expressed frustration but said they can’t move forward with discipline or licensure penalties because the Indiana Attorney General’s Office has not yet filed a formal administrative complaint.
Indiana law places the initial responsibility for professional discipline investigations with the attorney general, not the licensing board itself.
Consumers or employers can file complaints with the attorney general’s office, which reviews the allegations and determines whether to pursue discipline before a licensing board. The attorney general is charged with investigating the case first, however, before the board decides any discipline or licensing action.
Still, in serious cases, the attorney general can bypass the usual months-long investigatory process by seeking a summary suspension — an emergency action that immediately restricts a license if the professional poses a “clear and immediate danger to the public health and safety.”










This is not a small amount of medication. This is a very significant amount of controlled substances.


– Indiana Board of Pharmacy member Jason Jablonski 


Such emergency suspensions are commonly used in drug diversion cases, according to members of the state pharmacy board.
But last week, Autumn Murphy, a deputy attorney general overseeing Knoth’s consumer complaint, told the board that the office’s investigation is ongoing.
Murphy repeatedly emphasized that the attorney general’s office is bound by confidentiality rules.
She told the board that two separate consumer complaints are pending: one against the hospital and another against Knoth.
When asked again this week by the Capital Chronicle about the status of the investigation and whether the office had concerns about Knoth continuing to hold a license, spokesperson Slayde Settle said only that the attorney general’s office “cannot comment on active litigation.”
Knoth’s pharmacy license is currently set to automatically renew in June, unless action is taken before then.
“We have issued summary suspensions on far less in front of us,” pharmacy board member Anderson said. “I would raise this to the level of when we are presented with a federal indictment. … We have an alleged diversion of this astronomical amount of drugs that supposedly walked out of a pharmacy unaccounted for.”

Jablonski cited a separate but recent case that came before the board “that was very similar — and we got an emergency suspension really quickly.”
“Whether they diverted for personal use or diverted for sale, it’s still a huge risk to have somebody out there with an active license who was terminated for that particular action,” he said.
The licensing board is scheduled to hold a hearing in April to consider the hospital’s pharmacy license, which was already up for renewal. 
“But we’re not so concerned about the hospital,” Jablonski said. “We understand that they’ve had a big wake up call, and they’re making some changes. They know they need to — and they’re probably not done with the DEA on this, either.”
“Apparently, there’s nothing we can do about the pharmacist, though,” he said. “It’s just what it is. … We’re handcuffed.”
Although Indiana law allows licensing agencies to delay renewals for up to 120 days if concerns arise during the renewal process, it does not permit boards to independently suspend a license without action from the attorney general.
“The risk of having a pharmacist that allegedly stole millions of milligram doses of narcotics and Schedule II drugs — I would think the risk of having him licensed for a year-and-a-half now after that is higher than any benefit of him carrying a license,” Anderson said. “It’s just hard to fathom that we haven’t at least seen the pharmacist before the board.”

Barbara Anne Washington said the bill would tell mothers, ""We see you. We want to lower all the barriers...that come along with being a new parent"" (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Baby bottles, baby wipes and breast pump supplies would be exempt from state and local sales taxes under a bill discussed by a Missouri Senate committee Wednesday.
The bill, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. Barbara Anne Washington of Kansas City, would eliminate what she described as a “parenting tax” on the items.
“Anything we can do for mothers and to help the families is what I think we should all be down here doing,” Washington told The Independent.
Washington said the bill complements a law passed by the General Assembly last year that excluded diapers and feminine hygiene products from the state sales tax, and state lawmakers in the Senate Committee on Economic and Workforce Development expressed support. But Washington said she anticipates her bill will face opposition this year. 
The bill comes as Gov. Mike Kehoe calls for the elimination of Missouri’s individual income tax and state lawmakers consider increases in sales taxes to help replace revenue the state would lose.
A constitutional amendment introduced on Jan. 13, the day of Kehoe’s annual State of the State address, would allow lawmakers to raise state and local sales taxes “for the purpose of reducing and eliminating the state individual income tax.”
Though Kehoe said in his speech that he would not tax agriculture, health care or real estate, the proposed amendment, if passed by Missouri voters, would authorize state lawmakers to tax “transactions involving any goods and services.”
Kehoe’s budget plan proposes cutting $600 million in general revenue expenditures in fiscal year 2027, and the governor in his speech warned lawmakers against reversing his recommended cuts or introducing new spending items.
Washington said she doesn’t think Missouri’s dwindling revenues and diminishing surplus should rule out measures to help families in need.
“If we can let rich people not pay taxes on capital gains, why can’t we let the working people have a benefit as well?” Washington said.
State lawmakers last year repealed Missouri’s capital gains tax despite concerns at the time that revenue losses projected by the state for the measure were inaccurate. The state now anticipates that the tax cut will cost about $500 million in revenue during the current fiscal year and then $360 million annually —more than triple the original estimates.
Parents spend an average of $60 to $150 on baby bottles during a child’s first year, according to an estimate from the state’s revenue department. Though most insurance companies cover the cost of a basic breast pump, according to that estimate, 40% to 55% of parents pay an additional $70 to $200 to purchase an upgraded pump.
The fiscal note for Washington’s bill indicates it could cost the state roughly $1.8 million in fiscal year 2027 and then $2.4 million annually.
State lawmakers praised Washington’s proposed legislation and another bill sponsored by state Sen. Mike Moon, an Ash Grove Republican, that would give a $2,400 tax exemption to taxpayers during the year of their child’s birth.
State Sen. Adam Schnelting, a Republican from St. Charles, voiced support for Washington’s bill.
“Anytime I can get on board with reducing or eliminating taxes and encouraging a higher birth rate and encouraging families to grow, I think it’s a good bill,” Schnelting said.
Ryan DeBoef, testifying on behalf of Cross-Lines Community Outreach, which runs Diaper Bank of the Ozarks, described the bill as “a nice resource…to make these kind of products more accessible for our neediest.”
While the bill in its current form would exempt infant care products from state and local sales taxes, Washington said she is open to an amendment leaving local taxes intact.
Washington said that for mothers struggling to make ends meet, the bill is “more than the pennies and the dimes that they’ll save.”
“It keeps more money in the pockets of Missourians, especially as we are challenging affordability at this time,” Washington said. “It reduces the toxic stress that leads to poor health for the mother, which in turn leads to [poor health for] the baby.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010825_washington1-1024x667.jpg,,,2026-01-22 07:37:52.020996

Extreme cold temperatures are expected across the state of Vermont starting Friday night and continuing into Sunday, according to the National Weather Service, which forecasted windchills to drop to as low as minus 40 degrees in some areas. 
Two arctic fronts are anticipated to roll across Vermont in coming days. The first on Thursday could see possible snow squalls, while the second on Friday is forecast to plummet temperatures, according to Scott Whittier, a warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Burlington. 
Forecasts predict subzero temperatures everywhere in the state, with some communities not cresting out of the negative temperatures at all on Saturday, according to Whittier. The arctic front is predicted to drop temperatures to their lowest point of the season so far.
“On Friday night and Saturday, the winds will be howling,” Whittier said.
Whittier said people should limit their exposure outside as much as possible, and recommended that residents check their heating systems and allow faucets to drip to mitigate possible frozen and burst pipes. 
The Vermont Department of Public Safety’s Emergency Management division recommended on its Facebook page that residents ensure they have enough fuel, like oil, propane or wood, to heat their home before temperatures drop, adding that running out during the weekend could be costly. More safety recommendations can be found on the emergency management division’s website. 
The weather service said it was too early to issue an extreme cold warning or cold warning advisory, but Whittier said the Burlington office will most likely take that step once more data is available.    
Homelessness organizations and municipalities across the state have already begun mobilizing to open emergency shelters and warming centers for unhoused people who are at risk. 
In Burlington, the expected temperatures of minus 10 degrees prompted Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak to open an emergency shelter at the Miller Center at 130 Gosse Court, according to a press release. Officials estimate over 200 people are sleeping unsheltered in the region, according to the city and Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity, with many of the preexisting shelters and state-operated motel programs at capacity. 
Through a state grant, the Vermont Interfaith Action, a statewide network of faith communities, coordinates emergency shelters throughout the state and can make around 200 beds available across the state once the minus 10 degree threshold is reached, according to VIA’s executive director Melissa Battah.

“This weekend clearly will require activation,” she said.
In Montlipier, an emergency cold weather shelter in the basement of the City Hall building is expected to open Friday, according to the Montpelier Emergency Cold Weather Shelter website. 
Jay Voorhees, pastor of Trinity United Methodist Church and member of the board of the Montpelier Emergency Cold Weather Shelter, said severe injury and death due to cold will be a definite risk this weekend. Last month in Barre, an unhoused man sleeping outside in minus 17 degree weather died due to cold exposure.  
“I think folks think that, ‘Oh, I can do this, I’m from Vermont, I know how to survive in the cold,’” Voorhees said. “But when it gets below 10, honestly when it gets below freezing, but when it gets below 10 and in the single digits … it becomes much more dangerous.”   
Voorhees has already begun reaching out to community members to make sure there are enough volunteers to staff the emergency shelter overnight. 
Tess Taylor, Barre’s homelessness and housing liaison, said people may not be aware of the effects of the cold on their body until it is too late, especially if they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. According to Taylor, the Barre City Police Department will be patrolling for people that do not have shelter. 
“It’s clear that for someone living outside, a cold night is not just uncomfortable,” said Daniel Barlow, the executive director of the People’s Health & Wellness Clinic in Barre, a free clinic that regularly serves unhoused people. 
“It’s a medical emergency.”

Vermont has struggled to find places to care for youth in state custody since the closure of Woodside, the scandal-plagued Essex facility that housed some Vermont children accused of juvenile offenses. The state has attempted to replace Woodside with a new facility in Newbury or Vergennes, but in both cases local government poured cold water on the initiative. 
With fewer programs and beds available, the state has relied on so-called emergency staffings to care for youth — instances in which state staff or contractors oversee kids in makeshift locations like state offices while they search for more permanent foster care or residential placements. Vermont has also leaned on its new, temporary Red Clover facility, a four-bed program in Middlesex, to house children charged with juvenile offenses or adult crimes. 
“Over the past several years, we have focused on securing safe environments for children and youth who have experienced trauma and require specialized care to ensure their safety and the safety of others,” Pike said in an email. 
The new Abraxas contract is meant to support Vermont’s “high-end system of care,” Pike added, or youth in state custody in crisis situations and who have intense needs.  
Because Vermont lacks sufficient in-state programs, the state has contracted with Abraxas and others for out-of-state residential care for children in state custody, but the company’s operation in Vermont is new. 
“Our collaboration with Abraxas historically and thus far has been positive,” Pike said. 
Abraxas, like many organizations that operate youth residential treatment facilities, has drawn criticism for the quality of care it provides. Late last year, Pennsylvania revoked the license of one Abraxas facility due to “gross incompetence, negligence, and misconduct in operating the facility,” according to state officials.
More recently, Abraxas has come under fire for its work holding unaccompanied migrant youth in Pennsylvania for the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement. Over 12 years, state inspectors documented at least 15 incidents in which staff physically mistreated children at that facility, Abraxas Academy, according to the Washington Post and The Independent. 
Abraxas did not respond to emails requesting comment in December and this week.
Pike, the Department for Children and Families spokesperson, said the department’s leadership “was unaware of licensure revocations in other states” when the state finalized its new contract with Abraxas in mid-December.
“We remain committed to strict regulation and licensure procedures for all entities caring for our children and youth,” she added. “We maintain regular contact with programs and the youth in our care. Family Services will take all necessary measures to ensure contract compliance and provide informed follow-up if issues arise.”   
Vermont’s youth watchdog responds
Matthew Bernstein, Vermont’s Child, Youth and Family advocate, said the primary need for youth in state custody is safety. 
But too often, he cautioned, state programs are designed to fill the immediate need of finding a place for youth to stay temporarily without a focus on what’s best for children.
“Yes, we have to get through the day, but that’s just not good enough for families and children,” he said. “Vermont has long had an issue where youth are placed in congregate care settings longer than their needs require.”
Rather than pouring money into the highest-end of the residential care spectrum — programs for kids already in state custody like the West River Haven — Bernstein said the state needs to prioritize preventative programs catered to children who live at home with their guardians. 
Bernstein acknowledged that the new Brattleboro provider would help keep youth from being warehoused in unlicensed settings, an emergency practice the state has relied on in recent years. In those instances, youth typically aren’t provided treatment or educational services. But while some kids benefit from residential facilities, Bernstein said he doesn’t “see a lot of evidence that children improve when they leave these programs.” 
Without that data, he was skeptical of a continued investment in crisis stabilization and long-term residential treatment. 
Lauren Higbee, deputy advocate in the Office of the Child, Youth and Family Advocate, argued the state needs to investigate new companies with a fine-toothed comb before signing lucrative contracts.
“If Vermont truly has the intent to strengthen our system of care and our service array to be responsive to children and adolescent treatment needs, we would truly vet new providers coming into our state,” she said. “A simple Google search will (show) then it was just a few months ago Abraxas lost one of their licenses in a Pennsylvania program. You can see a history of several lawsuits and allegations regarding child physical and sexual abuse in their facilities.”
For Higbee, that history raises a fundamental question. 
“Who do we want to be serving Vermont children and youth?”

Critics warn of the costs.,"Environmentalists cheered new flood rules as a needed move to guard against climate impacts, while businesses said they would raise construction costs. (Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)New Jersey regulators approved a series of controversial flood rules in the hours before Phil Murphy’s second term as governor ended Tuesday, capping a six-year process that, at times, left both its backers and its detractors flummoxed.
The rules — called Protection Against Climate Threats Resilient Environments and Landscape Rule, or PACT REAL — raise elevation requirements in some areas of the state, expand flood maps, create new wetland protection and stormwater management rules, and place some limits on construction in flood-prone areas, among dozens of other changes.
Environmentalists hailed the Department of Environmental Protection’s adoption of the rules as a long-sought victory that would prepare New Jersey for higher water lines and worsening weather over the coming decades.
Bill to limit plastic utensils in restaurants wins legislative approval

Allison McLeod, acting executive director of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters, said the group is thrilled to see the rules finally adopted “after years of hard work and advocacy.”
“Every storm and flood makes it painfully clear how exposed our communities are as the climate crisis accelerates,” McLeod said.
Among other things, the rules will require new buildings in flood-prone coastal areas to be elevated by at least 4 feet, a requirement business and construction groups have charged will raise costs and depress development.
That requirement was pared down from 5 feet by changes made to the rules proposal in July in an effort to assuage detractors, though the change did little to win their support.
The adopted rule will still carry new costs for developers and discourage construction in the state, said Ray Cantor, deputy chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association.
“These rules, across the board, throughout the state, make it much more difficult to get a permit approved, much more costly to even apply for a permit,” he said. “We think this is going to hold New Jersey back from building more affordable houses and urban redevelopment, more energy facilities.”
Supporters have argued that worsening weather systems and increasingly common floods — like a flash flood that killed two in Plainfield in July — necessitated stricter standards, ones that would only become more necessary as sea levels continue to rise over the coming decades.
Doug O’Malley, executive director of Environment New Jersey, said what the state has done with the new rules is say, “We need to get ready for the future.”
“We don’t need to shake the magic eight ball to say what’s going to happen with sea level rise, what’s going to happen with climate change,” O’Malley said.
Though the rules were adopted Tuesday, they permit developers to submit applications under the prior regulatory scheme until July 20.
The rules’ adoption, made in the hours before Gov. Mikie Sherrill took office, could complicate Sherrill’s push for permit reform, Cantor said.
The proposal imposes some new permitting requirements on certain construction inside flood plains, though some requirements can be met with only a notification to state authorities.
Sherrill campaigned in part on streamlining the state’s permitting processes. On Tuesday, she issued an executive order directing the state to weigh new technologies to speed permit applications, among other things.
“You can’t move New Jersey forward with a regulatory system that’s going to hold everything back,” Cantor said.
The Department of Environmental Protection declined to comment, referring questions to the governor’s office. Acting Environmental Commissioner Ed Potosnak advocated for the adoption of the new rules prior to joining the administration.
A Sherrill spokesperson did not return a request for comment.
O’Malley said he doesn’t expect much discord between the new rules and Sherrill’s push for permitting reform, arguing looser rules would bring little benefit if they also brought shoddy homes.
“Ultimately, every governor — and certainly Governor Murphy and Governor Sherrill — wants to make sure the rules you have around development ensure that those homes are going to be there not just next year or next decade but for decades to come,” he said.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner) The Wisconsin Senate passed three constitutional amendment proposals Wednesday, including one to eliminate DEI, one to limit the executive partial veto power and another to prohibit closures of places of worship during emergencies.
With WisconsinEye, the state government video streaming service, still offline, the first floor session of the year for the Senate was livestreamed with the help of the Legislative Technology Services Bureau. 
Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) told reporters ahead of the session that after WisconsinEye halted its coverage on Dec. 15, the co-chairs of the Legislative Joint Audit Committee sent a letter with questions to the nonprofit organization. The letter had a Jan. 9 deadline to reply, but the organization did not provide responses until Jan. 21.
“We obviously believe that giving the public access to see what we’re doing is important, but… just blindly giving money to an organization that’s asking us for money, but not giving us any answers, is certainly not the solution at this time,” LeMahieu said. 
LeMahieu said he had not yet reviewed the answers WisconsinEye sent on Wednesday morning. He said the livestream was not a way to explore replacing WisconsinEye.
The state Legislature set aside $10 million in 2023 to help the organization build an endowment. But that grant came with a requirement that WisconsinEye to raise enough money to match the funds in order to access the state dollars. As it ran out of funds, WisconsinEye asked  the state to make money available for its operating expenses without the match requirement. 
LeMahieu noted that the organization had three years to raise funds and request money from the Joint Finance Committee.
“We just want to figure out, really, what’s going on. It’s not proof that we don’t need WisconsinEye…,” LeMahieu said. “The point of today is just so that the general public can see us in action today.” 
During the floor session, the Senate also took up bills on tax exemptions and education.
Constitutional amendments on DEI, partial veto and places of worship
The Senate passed three constitutional amendment proposals, each of which is on its second consideration, during its Thursday floor session. Constitutional amendment proposals in Wisconsin must pass two consecutive sessions of the Legislature before they go to the voters for final approval.
Republicans have relied on constitutional amendment proposals in recent years to bypass Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. According to a Ballotopedia review, Wisconsin voters decided on 258 ballot measures between  the state’s founding in 1846 and April 2025. About 71% — or 185 — measures were approved and 28% — or 73 — were defeated.
In the last five years, Wisconsin voters will have decided on 10 constitutional amendment questions — a divergence from some points in state history when Wisconsin has gone years without a constitutional amendment going before voters. 
The Senate voted 18-15 to pass a constitutional amendment that seeks to target and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts throughout Wisconsin local and state governments, officially setting it to go before voters in November. 
If approved by voters, AJR 102 would amend the state constitution to “prohibit governmental entities in the state from discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, public education, public contracting, or public administration.”
Democratic lawmakers said the amendment would take the state backwards. They suggested amending the proposal to enshrine equality and same-sex marriage protections. Those proposals were voted down. 
State Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee), who chairs the Legislative Black Caucus and has been working to call attention to the proposal over the last few weeks, likened the amendment to lawmakers rolling back Reconstruction efforts after the Civil War. She said the abandonment of Reconstruction efforts to bring justice to those who were enslaved, are the reason why the U.S. lived with Jim Crow laws for so long.
“Lawmakers made a decision to not protect [Americans],” Drake said. “Anything that was built was destroyed. It took nearly 80 years for our country to rectify that mistake with the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and landmark Supreme Court decisions to undo that harm.” 
Drake said the amendment would cause harm and eliminate measures that keep Wisconsinites safe. 
“Republicans will send us back to the pre-Civil Rights era, possibly further,” Drake said. 
Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) said the proposal is “long overdue” and would give Wisconsin voters the final say on “discrimination at all levels of government.” He said that programs including the Supplier Diversity Program, which was established in the 1980s and certifies minority-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned and woman-owned businesses to provide better opportunities for them to do business with the state of Wisconsin, and scholarships and loans within the state’s higher education system that consider race amount to discrimination.
“Past discrimination, however wrong, cannot be corrected with more discrimination,” Nass said, adding that merit, character and ability should be the only things considered when it comes to programs. 
The Senate also voted on voice vote to pass SB 652, which would amend several programs offered in the University of Wisconsin system to focus on “disadvantaged” students as opposed to considering race. Some of those programs include the minority teacher loan program and minority undergraduate grants. 
Bill coauthor Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) said the proposal will make it so people are able to receive help based on their specific life experiences, rather than having their life experiences presumed.
“We’ll finally make eligibility based on need,” Wimberger said. 
Drake emphasized that several of the programs, including the Minority Teacher Loan Program that was signed into law by Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson, were bipartisan efforts at the time they were created. She said lawmakers were forgetting history and abandoning the previous work that was done to address the barriers that students face. She said that the only thing that has changed is the election of  President Donald Trump, who has targeted DEI initiatives, and launched a “war against Black and brown people.”
“Shifting the policy solely to disadvantaged students without acknowledging racial, ethnic disparities risks eroding the progress made to address educational inequities,” Drake said. “That doesn’t solve anything, it covers up the issue.”
Curtailing partial veto powers 
SJR 116, if approved by voters, would prohibit the governor from using the state’s partial veto power to create or increase a tax or fee. It passed the Senate 18-15 along party lines and still needs to pass the Assembly before it would be set to go to voters. 
The proposal was introduced in reaction to Gov. Tony Evers’ partial veto that he exercised on the state budget in 2023 that extended annual school revenue limits for 400 years. 
Sen. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove) spoke against the proposal, saying that the partial veto power is one of the only checks that can “correct harmful or irresponsible provisions that come from the Legislature” and will “weaken one of the few checks that protects the public.” 
AJR 10 would prohibit the state from ordering the closure of places of worship during a state of emergency. The Senate concurred in the bill in a 17-15 vote, meaning it will officially go to voters in November.
The proposal was introduced in response to actions taken during a state of emergency declared by Evers during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no debate on the floor about the measure.
Tax exemptions
The Senate concurred in AB 38, which would mirror federal policy to exempt tips from state income taxes, in a 21-12 vote. Sen. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi), Sen. Brad Pfaff (D-Onalaska) and Jamie Wall (D-Green Bay) joined Republicans in favor of the bill. The Assembly passed the bill last week, so it will now head to Evers for consideration.
The bill would allow tipped employees to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from their federal taxable income. Those earning more than $150,000 would not be eligible for the deduction.
According to a Department of Revenue fiscal estimate, the bill would result in Wisconsin collecting $33.7 million less in revenue annually.
The Democratic lawmakers who opposed the bill said it didn’t do enough to ensure that employees make a stable wage. Tipped employees in Wisconsin can currently make a minimum wage of $2.33.
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said that raising the minimum wage would ensure that a person’s wage doesn’t rely on “the mood that somebody is in” or “somebody’s willingness to be sexually harassed.” 
“We should not put working people through that,” Roys said.
“You don’t get everything you want in life,” Jacque said. “I think this is something that is going to make life a little bit easier for those who work in the service industry.” 
“We don’t make the employers pay these people fairly,” Sen. LaTonya Johnson (D-Milwaukee) said. “These are the same people who have to rely on child care subsidies, who have to rely on Medicaid.”
Pfaff said in a statement that he voted for the bill because “hard working people continue to feel the pressure of rising costs every time they go to the grocery store, pay their rent and utility bills, and receive their new health insurance premium.” 
SB 69, which will allow teachers who spend money on classroom expenses to claim a subtraction on their state income taxes of up to $300, passed unanimously. 
Three education bills pass
The Senate voted 18-15 to concur in AB 602, a bill that instructs Evers to opt into the federal school choice tax credit program. It now goes to Evers. 
A provision in the federal law signed by President Trump will provide a dollar-for-dollar tax credit of up to $1,700 to people who donate to a qualifying “scholarship granting program” to support certain educational expenses including tuition and board at private schools, tutoring and books, but governors must decide whether to opt in and have until Jan. 1, 2027 to do so.
Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said during a press conference that the program would help provide additional funding to students without using state dollars. She emphasized that if the state doesn’t opt in, then Wisconsinites could still benefit from the credit by donating to programs in participating states, but those dollars would not go to Wisconsin students.  
“We want to see those dollars stay in Wisconsin,” Felzkowski said. 
Evers has previously said he wouldn’t opt the state into the program. He could veto the Republican bill instructing him to do so when it arrives at his desk. 
Sex ed legislation
SB 371 passed 18-15 along party lines. It would add requirements for school districts that provide human growth and development programs to show high definition video of the development of the brain, heart, sex organs and other organs, a rendering of the fertilization process and fetal development and a presentation on each trimester of pregnancy and the physical and emotional health of the mother. It now goes to the Assembly for consideration. 
Roys, the Madison Democrat, criticized the bill as being part of a “nationwide effort by some of the most extreme anti-abortion… to try to indoctrinate young children.” She noted that some of Wisconsin’s prominent anti-abortion organizations support the bill including the Wisconsin Catholic Conference, Pro-Life Wisconsin and Wisconsin Right to Life. 
Felzkowski, the GOP author of the bill, said young people deserve to know “what happens to them, what happens to their body, what happens to a fetus… What are you afraid of? Why would a child having knowledge scare you?”
The Senate concurred in AB 457 18-15 and will now go to Evers for consideration. The bill would require Wisconsin school districts to submit their financial reports to the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) on time before they can ask voters for funding through a referendum. It was introduced in reaction to Milwaukee Public Schools approving a large referendum and a subsequent financial reporting scandal in 2024.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana doctors, patients and others lined up Wednesday to testify on a contentious proposal allowing anyone to file potentially lucrative lawsuits related to the illegal use of abortion-inducing drugs.
Senate Bill 236 also lets Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita’s office sue in some cases, changes reporting requirements for abortion-related filings and redefines what abortion is.
“It really aims to close what’s a perceived loophole” around such drugs, said author Sen. Tyler Johnson, R-Leo. He is an emergency room physician.
The legislation would prohibit manufacturing, distributing, mailing, prescribing or possessing abortion-inducing drugs in Indiana — with carveouts for the drugs’ other uses, federal law, the U.S. Constitution and a pregnant woman’s own actions.
Anyone could enforce the ban through two types of civil lawsuits, which would only require intent rather than a successful or even attempted abortion. And they’d be able to sue for up to 20 years.
The first is a wrongful death action. If a claimant can’t identify the manufacturer of the drug that caused the death or injury, liability would be split between all manufacturers in proportion with their share of the national market for abortion-inducing drugs at the time.
The second is a qui tam action, in which private individuals sue on behalf of the government.
Texas recently adopted a similar law.

“A qui tam case is where a person identifies fraud and waste of government funds and goes out to recoup those funds on behalf of the government and retains a small portion of those funds as their reward for shining light on government fraud,” civil litigator Kathleen DeLaney said. “There’s nothing about government waste or fraud in this bill whatsoever, but what there is is the state of Indiana weaponizing individual citizens to go out and sue their co-citizens.”
In a qui tam action, a court would be required to award a successful plaintiff at least $100,000 and attorney’s fees — but largely wouldn’t be able to award legal costs to victorious defendants.
DeLaney, of law firm DeLaney & DeLaney, asserted the legislation creates “an army of private litigants, standing in the name of the government, claiming $100,000 bounties from others.”
State law would apply to the use of the drugs by Indiana residents regardless of where they’re used.
Senate Bill 236 would also authorize Rokita to sue on behalf of fetuses of Indiana residents against anyone who violates federal abortion drug mail laws.
Terminated pregnancy reports debated
Indiana has a near-total abortion ban, approved in 2022, that only allows the procedures in narrow circumstances: up to 20 weeks post-fertilization to save the mother’s life or if the fetus has been diagnosed with a fatal anomaly, and up to 10 weeks post-fertilization in cases of rape or incest.
Doctors already must file a terminated pregnancy report with the Indiana Department of Health for each abortion performed in the state. The bill originally would have made those public, but it was amended out in committee.
An ongoing lawsuit has thus far resulted in a judicial ruling that they are medical records.
Senate Bill 236 adds to the lengthy list of details on the reports — including the name of each person assisting with the report.
The attending physician would also have to certify, under penalty of perjury, that they reviewed the TPR, the information is correct and the abortion was performed in accordance with Indiana law. Incomplete forms would be subject to investigation by IDOH and the Office of Inspector General.
In Wednesday’s amendment, Johnson said, “We essentially are simplifying it to say those reports are private, so that they’re not publicly disclosable.” The reports would no longer be forwarded to Rokita.

“If we’re making them private, I want a second set of eyes (on them),” he added, so they’d be reported to the inspector general instead.
Numerous witnesses, however, argued that what’s collected is invasive and identifiable.
Hamilton County resident Amber Dowd said she was forced to fill out a TPR for a son who “had no brain, no spinal cord, no way of having life.” She shared the loss on social media.
“The TPR report that I filled out had a lot of identifying information, so it’s really easy to find out where I am,” Dowd told the Capital Chronicle.
Fake Facebook profiles were created about Dowd, her business and her husband, Michael — who she said lost his job as a result. The news even made it to her three living sons’ classmates.
“You know what that Facebook profile said? ‘Mike Braun didn’t kill your baby. You did,'” Dowd said, during her emotional testimony. “He didn’t have a brain!”
Another mother, Hendricks County resident Danielle Spry, said she terminated a wanted pregnancy after the fetus was diagnosed with likely life-threatening health complications.
“This wasn’t just an abortion. … This was the day that my daughter died,” Spry said. “… All of this is so violating, to think that these private medical records, that are between me and my doctor for a personal decision that I made for my family and my daughter, would be looked at by any of you!”
“How dare any of you look at me and say that you would have done anything different?” she added.
Defining abortion
Senate Bill 236 also redefines “abortion” in state code to any means intended to “cause the death of an unborn child,” specifying that birth control and contraceptives don’t count. It also exempts acts intended to save the child’s life or health, remove a miscarried or stillborn child, or remove an ectopic pregnancy — a dangerous condition in which a fertilized egg grows outside the uterus.
But medical professionals repeatedly warned lawmakers the new definition doesn’t account for other serious conditions.
Dr. Erin Lips, an Indianapolis-based obstetrician-gynecologist, told the committee about a young patient in her 20s suffering from a suspected molar pregnancy: “an abnormal pregnancy that can consist of fetal parts and cardiac activity, but will never develop into a baby.”
She warned lawmakers that the tissue can cause severe illness — including cancer — and death.
“Because of the changes in the abortion legislation, her doctor did not feel comfortable providing the (dilation and curettage) to her, so he referred her to IU,” Lips said. “Given transportation issues for the patient, her appointment was scheduled for weeks later.”

That delay in care “threatened her life and potential future fertility,” she continued, with the patient admitted to IU with liver and kidney failure. She recovered but was later diagnosed with post-molar cancer, according to Lips.
Senate Bill 236 advanced from committee Wednesday on a 9-4 vote.
LaGrange Republican Sen. Sue Glick, who authored the near-total abortion ban, joined Democrats in opposition. She feared women would be identified by details in the reports.
“In small towns, I guarantee you they can piece this together. … I guarantee you there are people who will decide that they are on the moral high ground, and they will bring these actions,” she said. “But they’re second-guessing medical professionals in an area that they do not have the expertise in.”
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, pushed back against claims the bill would have a “chilling effect” on doctors.
“The chilling effect will be on people who are providing abortions illegally and illegally prescribing and or mailing these abortion pills into this state,” she said. “… Follow your oath, follow the law, make sure these women are taken care of and file the report.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Heading into his second year as Oklahoma House Speaker, Kyle Hilbert, hopes to pass reforms to education policy and regulate data centers. 
With education initiatives among his top priorities, Hilbert, R-Bristow, said he wants to see legislation passed that permanently bans cellphones in schools and that improves early childhood literacy and reading scores. 
“For too long, we as Oklahomans have just accepted, frankly, failure on the part of the education system and being at or near the bottom of education rankings and outcomes for our kids, and I just think that’s unacceptable,” he said. “We’ve got to strive for excellence.”
Hilbert, who leads the lower chamber, said he filed legislation aimed at improving literacy that is modeled after what’s known as the “Mississippi Miracle.” This refers to a series of policies in Mississippi that were focused on improving childhood literacy, including student supports, a focus on phonics, tutoring, accountability metrics and teacher training programs. The program’s success was bolstered by a $100 million donation to create it.
House Bill 4420 would align colleges of education in teaching the “science of reading,” emphasize early identification of literacy deficiencies, and create a third grade retention standard. 
“The goal, though, is not to retain a bunch of kids in the third grade,” Hilbert said. “The goal is that we have this accountability metric that says if you don’t pass the third grade, you’re retained. But the hope is for school districts to identify students if they’re behind in kindergarten, first grade, second grade, to have those earlier interventions and meet with parents, meet with students, and let them know you know their students behind, and so we can catch them up sooner.”
Hilbert said he also wants to pass legislation to permanently expand the state’s school cellphone ban. 
The Legislature passed a law in 2025 that banned cellphones in schools for one year. Hilbert said it was very effective.
The law required all public school districts to comply with the cellphone ban for the 2025-26 school year and gave local school boards control over continuing the policy afterward.
Hilbert said he expects regulation of data centers to be another major topic of conversation at the Capitol this session. He said he was working on legislation, as were other lawmakers, on ensuring data centers “pay their own way” in Oklahoma. 
The goal of the legislation would be to protect consumers in Oklahoma from having to pay for increased energy capacity to support data centers, he said. 
Data centers currently qualify for an ad valorem reimbursement program, where manufacturers coming to Oklahoma are exempt from paying property taxes for the first five years with the state paying instead, Hilbert said. 
“If they’re going to come to Oklahoma, taxpayers should not be subsidizing that,” he said. “They should pay their own way in terms of utility rates and in terms of the tax structure.”
The number of data centers have been growing with a need to keep up with demand for energy from artificial intelligence use. These centers have been under increased scrutiny as their presence often drives up costs of energy for the consumer.

“None of these proposed reductions account for any potential new costs within the Medicaid program or other state agencies resulting from reduced access to services and providers, leading to selection of alternative services,” such as emergency rooms and institutional care, “or engagement with other systems,” like the courts, prisons or jails, state health officials wrote, according to a copy of the report that the Idaho Capital Sun obtained through a public records request. 
Meanwhile, Idaho state lawmakers are delving into what the governor’s proposal for $22 million in cuts to Medicaid — a public assistance program that provides health insurance to around 345,000 Idahoans — could look like.

 Little proposed cutting Medicaid dental coverage, disability services

To cut Medicaid budget, governor says Idaho could remove disability, dental services

In Gov. Brad Little’s budget plan, he called for $22 million in Medicaid cuts next fiscal year — on top of extending cuts to doctor pay rates, which could save $23 million. The $22 million in extra Medicaid cuts could come from a range of rate reductions and service cuts, including potentially ending Medicaid dental coverage for adults, removing home and community-based services, or other rate reductions and service terminations, according to Little’s budget plan. 
The budget documents from the Department of Health and Welfare that detail the programs on the governor’s list say:

Dental, which covers preventive services, costs about $5.5 million in state general funds. About 231,000 adults use the service at least once a year. 
Home and community-based services, which are meant to help people with developmental disabilities live outside of institutional settings, cost about $176.5 million in state general funds. More than 16,400 Idahoans use the services at least once a year.

If home and community-based services are cut, the Department of Health and Welfare wrote that it “anticipates need for additional institutional providers as current capacity would not be sufficient to transition all Idahoans with disabilities who are served in the community today.”
The budget records, formally called a B8 form, were sent to the governor’s office on Dec. 31, Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Sun.

Since the governor’s budget plan was unveiled, the state’s revenue rebounded — turning what would’ve been a projected $40 million budget deficit this fiscal year into an estimated budget surplus of $106.2 million. Little’s Press Secretary Joan Vargas said in a statement Wednesday the governor’s budget still includes the extra Medicaid cuts. 
“The Governor’s (fiscal year 2027) budget recommendation still includes the additional $22 million Medicaid spending reduction because the budget is based on the revenue forecast at the end of the fiscal year, not on month-to-month revenue changes,” she told the Sun. 
 Idaho lawmakers on House Health and Welfare Committee to brainstorm cuts

In the coming weeks, lawmakers in the House Health and Welfare Committee will brainstorm what those extra cuts could look like. The committee is expected to deliver its recommendations to the Legislature’s budget committee, called the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, around early February. 
On Tuesday, JFAC’s new co-chair Rep. Josh Tanner spoke at length to the House Health and Welfare Committee on the process to make the cuts. He urged lawmakers to be cautious about doomsday-like warnings on the impact of cuts. 
“I’ve done several cuts within Health and Welfare, a lot within public health, and it was always like, ‘This will blow up the world if I do this.’ And then I do it, and we pass it, and it goes through. And then the next year, nothing really happened,” Tanner told lawmakers. 
Tanner, a Republican from Eagle, has criticized Gov. Brad Little’s budget proposal and has previously sponsored a bill to repeal Medicaid expansion, which covers about 90,000 Idahoans. Some Republicans say they’re considering repealing Medicaid expansion this year, but the governor didn’t include a plan for that in his Medicaid cut proposals. 
The House Health and Welfare Committee isn’t planning to meet the rest of this week, said Rep. John Vander Woude, the committee’s chairman. He told committee members to look into the budget in the meantime. 
 Senate Health and Welfare Committee chairwoman is unsure of plan to tackle Medicaid cuts

The Senate Health and Welfare Committee plans to hear a presentation on Monday focused on the Department of Health and Welfare’s overall agency budget. Committee chairwoman Sen. Julie VanOrden told the Idaho Capital Sun she isn’t sure how her committee will address proposed Medicaid cuts. 
“Hopefully we’ll have some discussion on what we have presented on Monday. … Maybe I’ll kind of poll members and see how they want to address that,” she said in an interview Wednesday. “Right now, at this point, we’re just trying to get through the administrative rules. And we can address budget items when we’re done with that.”
She said she’ll meet with the House committee chairman about how to then proceed.
In the House Health and Welfare Committee on Tuesday, Rep. Don Hall, a Republican from Twin Falls, asked Tanner how JFAC would factor in concerns that cuts could drive up costs elsewhere.
“Certainly it will look good if you can cut budgets on the state level, but if that just cost shifts down to the counties, (the) same citizens are paying the same taxes,” Hall said.
Tanner encouraged lawmakers to “dig in, not just listening to a lobbyist” or state health officials.

Ed Seidel has historically avoided wading into the day-to-day affairs of the Wyoming Legislature. But a proposal to slash UW’s recommended block grant by $40 million — a move that could result in job losses — pushed him to break his typical silence.
The post Staring down possible layoffs, University of Wyoming’s president speaks out against proposed budget[...]","University of Wyoming President Ed Seidel has historically avoided wading into the day-to-day affairs of the Legislature. Even as lawmakers have turned an increasingly relentless eye to the state’s lone four-year public university, taking aim at its diversity, equity and inclusion programming and any curricula that smell remotely of “wokeness,” Seidel has publicly stayed mum. 
That’s in part, he has said, because of the fluid nature of the Legislature and the whims of its lawmakers — a proposal born one day could be dead the next. And though many conversations don’t reach the public spotlight, university representatives often speak with lawmakers behind the scenes.
But the Legislature’s opening bid last week to slash the University of Wyoming’s block grant by $40 million pushed Seidel to break from his usual silence and publicly address the proposed cut point-blank:
“Please be assured that UW leaders are following and participating in this process very closely,” Seidel wrote in a campus-wide email sent Jan. 15, two days after the Legislature’s chief budgeting arm voted for the cuts. 
“We’re advocating for the interests of the state’s university and informing legislators about the potential impacts of a reduction of this magnitude,” he continued. “We have hope that the decision-makers will recognize, as did the governor, that such a cut — almost 11 percent of UW’s state block grant for the biennium — would be both harmful and unnecessary, especially considering the lack of a financial crisis for state government.” 
The proposed block grant cut — championed by hard-line Republican members of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, which won control of the House in 2024 — adds to lawmakers’ rejection of a $12.5 million request for matching funds and a $6 million ask for the school’s athletics department, as well as their vote to defund Wyoming Public Media, which is housed at the university. The committee also denied Gov. Mark Gordon’s recommendation to give salary bumps for state workers, including almost $28 million for University of Wyoming employees who last saw a raise in 2023. 
What came out of the Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee last week was a far cry from Gordon’s recommendation of about $374 million in block grant funds for 2027 and 2028, or roughly $187 million per year (Gordon recommended other state funding as well for the university, but that money would be earmarked for specific purposes, whereas the school can use block grant funding however it sees fit). The committee reduced Gordon’s suggestion to about $334 million. They also added a number of footnotes that specify how some of this money can be used, bringing the total unrestricted funding to roughly $322 million or around $161 million per year.

To give those numbers context, the university’s 2026 unrestricted operating budget totaled almost $410 million, the school’s spokesperson, Chad Baldwin, told WyoFile. The school’s unrestricted state aid comprised more than $164 million of that. 
Put simply, the university is staring down the barrel of a cut that could alter the school in dramatic ways, Seidel explained — including the potential loss of jobs. 
“This was such a major proposal that I thought we should make sure that our community understood what was at stake,” Seidel told WyoFile in a phone call on Tuesday.
The proposed cut to the school’s recommended block grant comes amid an already difficult time for the university. Enrollment has declined following national trends. The school has lost some key faculty and leaders. And Seidel himself has not only faced discontent from lawmakers, but also from the campus community — in April, the school’s faculty senate overwhelmingly delivered a vote of no confidence against his leadership.
If the Legislature’s proposed cuts come to pass, they would likely result in layoffs, given that a big chunk of the school’s budget is reserved for paying people — according to Baldwin, 77% of the 2026 unrestricted operating budget is earmarked for salaries, wages and benefits. 
“Most of that funding does go for people, so that would mean we’d have to have fewer people in order to accommodate the cuts,” Seidel told WyoFile. (He noted that this is speculation, and he would need to see the Legislature’s finalized language to know for certain how the budget would impact personnel.) 
Then there’s the matter of university sports, which flood Laramie’s streets with fans on game days. Seidel told WyoFile that losing the university’s Division I status would be “a serious concern” if the proposed funding cut for athletics came to pass. The $6 million request that lawmakers axed stems from a landmark NCAA settlement that allows colleges to compensate student-athletes for their name, image and likeness. Even Wheatland Republican Rep. Jeremy Haroldson, a Freedom Caucus member, spoke against this cut. 
What’s more, another two-year budget cycle without raises could compromise the school’s ability to retain faculty, Seidel said. “We will certainly lose faculty through people finding better opportunities if we aren’t able to keep up.” 
Laramie Democrat Rep. Ken Chestek, a professor emeritus of the university, fears that such losses would render Wyoming’s sole four-year university into “a feeder school” — an institution where students start their education but transfer elsewhere to finish it. 
It wouldn’t be the first time that UW has seen budget cuts of such magnitude. The school took hits during the tenures of former Govs. Dave Freudenthal and Matt Mead, when plummeting state revenue pushed the Legislature to pinch pennies. The university also faced a $30 million cut to its block grant during the pandemic-spurred economic downturn in 2020, when Seidel came in as president. 
But in those instances, the Legislature slashed budgets across state government. This time, as Seidel noted in his email last week, there is no revenue crisis.
“We worked hard to pivot to make sure we provided the best value possible even in the face of budget cuts,” Seidel told WyoFile. “This time, I don’t see how we can do that. We’ve already gone through the pruning exercises — I mean the deep ones — and so we’re just really going to have to damage the university if we have to implement such cuts.” 
The proposed budget restrictions are meant to curb “an increase in administration” and “woke education” at the university, Gillette Republican Rep. John Bear, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and the Wyoming Freedom Caucus’ former leader, told WyoFile. He said he feels that the university has turned against a “Wyoming way of life.” (Cody Republican Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, who now chairs the caucus, didn’t respond to WyoFile’s call.) 
Rather than funnel more money toward the university, Bear said he would prefer to see a bump in funding for Wyoming’s community colleges. At the same time, he noted that, for those who do attend the University of Wyoming, it’s important to him that their tuition stays low. (Bear pointed out that the Joint Appropriations Committee voted to increase the Hathaway Scholarship.)
“Reorganizing the university is a much larger task than we can tackle now, but we expect trustees to start paying attention to the people of Wyoming,” Bear said.

This continues a battle that the Freedom Caucus has been fighting from its genesis. Last budget session, caucus members and allies passed a footnote specifying that the school couldn’t use state funds for its Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion or on any other diversity, equity and inclusion programming. The University of Wyoming’s Board of Trustees subsequently backed Seidel’s recommendation to close the office and reassign staff. And for years, lawmakers have also targeted — so far without success — the school’s gender studies curricula.
It’s not surprising that the Freedom Caucus is pushing aggressively on the university’s budget. Caucus members and sympathizers ran on a platform of “cutting the hell” out of budgets, Laramie Democrat Sen. Chris Rothfuss, who is also a University of Wyoming professor, said. “They didn’t hide that from anyone.” 
What’s more, it’s an election year, and there’s no telling what the House and Senate will look like when the next session comes around, or if the caucus will maintain the leverage that it has now. “The Freedom Caucus is trying to flex its muscles,” Chestek, the Laramie Democrat, told WyoFile. “They’re trying to leverage their power to get what they can while they can.” 
While Seidel primarily addressed worries about the impact of the proposed budget cuts in his campus-wide email last week, he also wrote that “there are legitimate concerns expressed by lawmakers that we have been addressing and will continue to address.” Those concerns, Seidel told WyoFile, include questions about “whether or not universities across the country have liberal environments, and therefore conservative voices are suppressed.” 
UW, Seidel added, is “one of the first universities in the country to commit to institutional neutrality.” The school had also begun scrutinizing its diversity, equity and inclusion programming even before it was “faced with pressure from the Legislature,” he said. 
What’s been proposed is not the end of the story. The Legislature’s budget process has only begun, and it’s likely these numbers will change by the end of the session, particularly given that the Freedom Caucus doesn’t have as strong a grip over the Senate as it does in the House.

At the same time, it’s entirely possible that the university also hasn’t seen the end of potential budget restrictions. Lawmakers can specify in footnotes how UW is allowed to use its money. They’ve already added some, for example, to exempt the College of Education and the College of Agriculture, Life Sciences and Natural Resources from the cuts. The College of Education’s 2026 budget is almost $8 million, and the School of Agriculture’s budget is almost $33 million. The exclusion of these two colleges would mean the university would need to cut deeper elsewhere.
Much of the budget debate will likely stem from these footnotes, and it’s all but guaranteed that lawmakers will be proposing more of them on the House and Senate floors once the session starts. Bear told WyoFile that he plans to work on crafting potential budget footnotes over the next few weeks, targeting the use of state funds for particular curricula. (He noted, for example, an ecofeminism course that was once taught at the university. Baldwin, the school’s spokesperson, said the course is no longer offered.) The Freedom Caucus will likely hold a press conference on this topic at the beginning of the session, Bear said. 
Ultimately, whatever comes to pass won’t be Seidel’s problem for long — the president plans to leave his post in June. “I’ve stated publicly many times that I think my main goal right now is to put the university in the best possible position for the next president,” Seidel told WyoFile. “Budgets are an important part of that, but not the only part of that.”
Who will take the helm after Seidel departs remains to be seen. It’s uncertain whether the uproar over potential budget cuts might discourage some candidates from applying for the job. But there’s little doubt that whoever inherits this responsibility will be navigating rough waters.

Administrative court rules eight years after an appeal was filed that the BLM violated the Clean Air Act, undoing approval of Jonah Energy’s 141,000-acre development. 
The post Judges halt 3,500-well ‘NPL’ gas field in Wyoming’s Green River Basin appeared first on WyoFile .","A federal administrative court has revoked authorization to drill one of Wyoming’s largest gas fields in decades, concluding the project violates the Clean Air Act.
The Jonah Energy-led gas project in question, known as the Normally Pressured Lance field, had been litigated over sage grouse and pronghorn migration issues for years until it was given the greenlight by a federal appeals court in 2023. 
Simultaneously, the environmental advocacy organization WildEarth Guardians sought to block the project administratively through the U.S. Department of the Interior Board of Land Appeals. On Tuesday, the Santa Fe, New Mexico-based group announced that federal administrative judges had ruled in its favor on an 8-year-old appeal, throwing out approval to drill a gas field roughly the size of Zion National Park. 
“The Clean Air Act requires federal agencies to prove that their actions won’t worsen air pollution in already polluted areas, and this project didn’t meet that test,” said Rebecca Sobel, WildEarth Guardians’ climate and health director. “Whatever Jonah Energy wants to do to try to meet Clean Air Act requirements, we look forward to reviewing those proposals.”
The two-judge panel of the Interior Board of Land Appeals faulted the Bureau of Land Management for not complying with “unambiguous” regulations governing ground-level ozone, a human health hazard. Specifically, the administrative judges determined that mobile Jonah Energy drill rigs did not qualify for a “stationary source” pollution exemption that was used in an analysis of how much the gas field would affect the Green River Basin’s “nonattainment” ozone area. 
“Because we find error in BLM’s conformity determination, BLM approved the Record of Decision in error,” Interior judges Clifford Stevens and David Gunter concluded in their Jan. 15 decision.

They then “vacated” the decision, invalidating the Denver-based oil and gas exploration company’s authorization to drill in the gas field, which is 96% BLM land. 
Jonah Energy executive Paul Ulrich told WyoFile he stood behind the NPL’s air quality analysis and was “shocked” and “disappointed” with the judges’ decision. WildEarth Guardians’ appeal was filed in 2018, after a decade of effort to get the NPL field approved. 
“We firmly believe it was an excellent decision,” Ulrich said of the 2018 approval. “It accounted for and balanced the need for development with some very restrictive and innovative environmental constraints, in particular on air emissions.”

In a statement, Gov. Mark Gordon criticized the Interior court for halting production of 3,500 gas wells, and he pledged the state would “aggressively pursue all options available” to overturn the decision. 
“This action is unwarranted and misguided,” the governor said. “It demonstrates we have more work to do to bring wisdom back to the federal government.”
On the ground, production of the NPL field has been notably limited in an era marked by record-low gas prices. Jonah Energy drilled or spudded a total of 14 wells in the field’s first seven years, just 0.4% of what BLM approved, according to the Interior Board of Land Appeals decision. Ulrich said the slow pace of development in the NPL is related to activity in the adjacent 30,000-acre Jonah field.
“We’ve got maybe a handful of years of drilling inventory [left] in the Jonah,” Ulrich said. “At that point, certainly our expectation is to pivot to NPL.” 
During the planning phases, Jonah valued the 141,00-acre field at nearly $18 billion. 
The swath of high desert in western Wyoming is also considered ecologically valuable, and it contains some of the most intact expanses of sagebrush-steppe remaining in the world, winter concentration areas used by 2,000 sage grouse and portions of the under-review Sublette Pronghorn Migration Corridor.

Jonah Energy and its agency partners have not yet decided next steps, Ulrich said. Starting an environmental impact statement from scratch in pursuit of a new decision makes “zero sense,” he said.
“We’re talking about one small portion of the record of decision,” Ulrich said. “The conformity determination can be easily rectified, I’m sure.” 
WildEarth Guardians also argued that the federal government violated the National Environmental Policy Act, though the Interior administrative justices did not rule on that claim because BLM will need to do additional NEPA analysis.
According to WildEarth Guardians’ Sobel, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum lacks the authority to overturn the appeals board’s decision. 
“It’s an independent administrative appellate court,” Sobel said. “IBLA decisions are final unless they’re challenged through further administrative or judicial review.”

Some oil and gas industry watchdogs are skeptical that NPL field’s setback will stick. Linda Baker, longtime director of the Upper Green River Alliance, praised WildEarth Guardians’ successful appeal, but she called the result a “liquid and strange situation” and a “surprising New Year’s gift.”
“My first thought was, ‘This has never happened before,’” Baker said. “Especially to something that’s an ongoing project.” 
Pinedale resident Jana Weber, who’s involved with the Sublette County air quality advocacy group CURED, also shared mixed feelings. 
“Anything that helps guarantee better air, we’re totally in favor of,” she said. “I think it’s a very good thing.” 
But Weber also remarked that the outcome was confusing. The plans navigated environmental regulators’ vetting process and got “fully permitted,” she said. 
“Now, all of the sudden, they’re saying, ‘No, it really shouldn’t have been permitted,’’’ Weber said. “The whole thing is so weird.”

Today, however, we believe Sen. Steve Daines, Sen. Tim Sheehy, Rep. Ryan Zinke, Rep. Troy Downing, and Gov. Greg Gianforte are failing to uphold this oath. We also believe that the grave dangers facing our country today will grow worse unless these five men take immediate action to defend the Constitutional rights of all Americans, condemn political violence, and oppose the use of lethal force against U.S. citizens. 
We recently signed a petition making these requests of each lawmaker, and we feel it’s important for us to explain why. 
The framers of our Constitution gave Congress the power to make war and the power to levy duties on imports. Today, Montana’s federal delegates have passed these powers into the hands of a single person, our president. The humanitarian and economic consequences of these decisions are now plain. Vladimir Putin is charging deeper into Western Ukraine; the Venezuelan president has been kidnapped; and China has an unprecedented trade surplus. Yet, our elected officials remain silent.
Here at home, our president has been similarly reckless. Lately, he has ordered federal prosecutors to investigate members of Congress for sharing their opinions on the use of U.S. military personnel at home and abroad. He’s also ordered an investigation of the Federal Reserve Board, which was created to insulate the U.S. economy from meddling by individual politicians. These attempts to suppress and control people with opposing political and economic views are violations of our shared freedom of speech. Yet, our elected officials remain silent.
Unfortunately, these attacks on our most valued freedoms aren’t only impacting public officials; they’re destroying American families and violently disrupting American neighborhoods. Recently, The Wall Street Journal identified at least 13 instances of immigration officers “firing at or into civilian vehicles,” resulting in at least eight total gunshot wounds, two of which led to deaths. At least five of the people shot in this time period were also U.S. citizens. 
Most Americans agree that immigration laws should be enforced, but the massive scale and violent character of recent ICE deployments are destroying the lives of people like us—mothers, fathers, sisters, and brothers. As veterans who were trained to use lethal force, we condemn these shootings and killings, and we expect our elected officials to do the same. Yet, our elected officials remain silent.
We also expect our elected officials to condemn all forms of political violence no matter who they impact. This includes the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump, the January 6th attack on our U.S Capitol; and the murders of Charlie Kirk, Melissa Hortman, and Renee Good. This violence exists on both sides of the political aisle, and it hurts all of us. Yet, in some instances, our elected officials speak up, and in other instances they remain silent.
As veterans of the armed services, we understand the importance of following orders. As officers of the armed services, we also understand the importance of giving orders. Most importantly, we understand that all orders—both given and received—must be consistent with our oath to defend the U.S. Constitution. 
For these reasons, we recently joined hundreds of our friends and neighbors in the State Capitol Rotunda, and we called on Sen. Daines, Sen. Sheehy, Rep. Zinke, Rep. Downing, and Gov. Gianforte to uphold their oath of office. Together, we asked them to end their silence and respond to our petition. 
Respectfully, we now urge them to consider our concerns and reply in a manner that honors the Constitution we all swore to defend.

The death of friends often stirs regrets in us. But we can push it aside and embrace their memories instead, writes columnist Walt Gasson.
The post When regret visits appeared first on WyoFile .","Somebody told me once that the price of longevity is regret. With a little more than seven decades under my belt now, the list of regrets is longer than I care to dwell on. Those regrets visit sometimes in the middle of the night, unannounced and unwelcome. Too frequently, they involve someone who is no longer with us. 

Opinion

I guess that’s to be expected at my age. I’ve lived a wonderful life with wonderful people who loved me and I loved them. But my friend Steve’s death this year hit me hard. It wasn’t unexpected. Pancreatic cancer gives no quarter. When he died, the memories came back, smelling of mule sweat and saddle leather. The terrible mule wreck on Horse Creek, and the pitch-dark and rain as we made our painful way out. I spent the next few days as a guest of the kind people at St. John’s Hospital in Jackson. I don’t remember much from that time, but I remember that every time I woke, he was there. Sometimes we’d talk, sometimes he’d just sit there. He never quit me through it all. And that is one of the things that I loved most about him. It was never about him — it was about everyone else, and he never quit.
And so, the regret comes sneaking in. I should have visited him before he passed. I should have been there for him and for his kids and his companion the way he was for me. I guess it shouldn’t be any big surprise that when you hit a certain age, your friends are going to show an alarming tendency to move on to the next life. But somehow, I never dreamed that I’d have to get good at dealing with their passing.
It’s not like I didn’t have some experience with the deaths of people that I love:
Old Gus, my dad, my hero and my best friend, died in 1967. I was only 12. But he taught me to saddle my own horse, to drive a stick shift and to love Wyoming, its history, wild things and wild places. I regret the adventures we never got to have together.
His best friend, Luke, took me under his long and powerful wing, making me part of his own family and working me like a rented mule. He died a decade later, and I missed his funeral. I should have been there for him and for his family.
Harriet, my grandmother and the acknowledged matriarch of the Gasson clan, died only a few years later. She lost the only two men she would ever love in the span of 11 months back in 1920, and she was sad to the end of her days. I couldn’t find tears to mourn her when she passed. I should have.
Doug was my first workplace mentor. He was brilliant, profane, often self-destructive and nearly impossible to work for. But he gave me wonderful opportunities I probably didn’t deserve. We parted on less than perfect terms, and then he died. I didn’t go to his funeral, and I didn’t forgive him. I should have.
Ken hired me almost right out of college, and was my next teacher. He was the toughest, hardest-working human being I knew. I totaled a $50,000 piece of equipment one day, but he didn’t fire me. He just said, “Shit happens, kid. Don’t worry about it.” I should have been there for him after his wife died. I wasn’t. 
Grace was my mom. When Old Gus died, she became a single parent to a big, angry young son. She did so with characteristic love and kindness. She taught me to love books and learning and she loved me from the moment of my birth to the moment of her death. I should have been a better son. 
So many people, so many regrets. But maybe that’s not how you keep score. I’m certain that’s not how you honor someone who loved you and taught you and cut a trail through life for you to follow. Maybe it’s more about the memories — the people pass on, but the memories remain. 
The memories made Steve a great friend to me and to so many, and a great mentor to us all. He lived his life by what he knew to be true. I have a picture of him riding the dun-colored mule Bugs and leading the black mule Silas across a meadow north of Spread Creek. Ol’ Silas is loaded with hundreds of pounds of bison meat, plus the head and cape. It was my bison, a whopper of a bull about 11 years old and scarred from tail to topknot with the battles of his life. It’s October in that photo, the light is golden and the shadows are long. It’s a Mark Gocke photo, and it’s beautiful like all his work. But maybe more important than its beauty is its truth. The truth is this: We share this place with the bison and the elk and the grizzlies. We share it with each other. And in the end, we pass from this place and this life, just like that old bison. The memories remain.
Before we go, we can make those memories. We can teach and support and lift one another, like Steve. We can step in when things are hard and help those who are in pain, like Luke. We can forgive others their mistakes, like Ken. And we can give others the opportunity to shine, like Doug. We can be kind and gracious and loving like Grace. And we can teach the things that matter, like Old Gus. Those are the things that keep the regrets at bay when they come sneaking around in the middle of the night. And they’re the things that endure long after any of us remain, the reminders of our humanity.

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Republican state senators have a strong fundraising head start going into their primary campaigns as a presidential threat of political retribution looms over many of them from the failed Indiana congressional redistricting push.
That advantage, however, could quickly vanish if Gov. Mike Braun dips into nearly $2.3 million in campaign cash he built by the end of December to carry through on vows to back primary challengers to Republican senators who voted against redistricting.
A look at the potential political fallout from the doomed effort demanded by President Donald Trump for new congressional maps comes from updated state campaign finance reports released Wednesday covering through the end of 2025.
Besides the Republican intra-party square off, the new reports also show a fast fundraising start by secretary of state candidate Beau Bayh that made him the rare Democrat to have a campaign cash lead as he looks to challenge Republican incumbent Diego Morales.
Senate Republican retribution threat
Both Trump and Vice President JD Vance renewed calls of political vengeance over the weekend from the bruising Indiana Senate defeat in December of a proposed new U.S. House map aimed at giving Republicans all nine of the state’s congressional seats.
They both cast blame again on Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray for the Indiana redistricting loss, this time pointing to Virginia Democrats last week advancing a plan for new maps in that state.
A Trump social media post on Saturday said: “I was with David McIntosh of the Club for Growth, and we agreed that we will both work tirelessly together to take out Indiana Senate Majority Leader Rod Bray, a total RINO, who betrayed the Republican Party, the President of the United States, and everyone else who wants to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! We’re after you Bray, like no one has ever come after you before!”

The threats from Trump and Braun against Bray that began last fall did not seem to dent fundraising by the Senate Republican campaign committee — or by Bray’s campaign.
That organization, which Senate Republican leadership controls and typically backs all incumbent GOP senators, reported raising almost $1.3 million last year and ending 2025 with $2.3 million in available cash. 
Bray, who isn’t up for election until 2028, ended December with just over $1 million in his campaign account after raising about $335,000 during the year.
Meanwhile, of the eight Republican senators seeking reelection this year who voted against redistricting, only one reported less campaign cash on hand than any GOP challengers. That was Sen. Greg Walker, who raised no money last year as he planned to retire from the Legislature before reversing his decision this month.
Former Sen. Jim Merritt, who was a longtime leader of the Republican campaign arm before leaving the Senate in 2020, said he believed it was too late for many of the challengers to organize effective campaigns.
“If you’re gonna take on a Senate incumbent, you’ve gotta have a bazooka,” Merritt said in an interview. “You’ve gotta have some might behind your name and none of those people do.”
Josh Kelley, Braun’s chief of staff and top political adviser, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle in a text message that he would not comment on whether the Braun campaign will direct money toward primary challengers. 
Braun’s gubernatorial campaign, coming off his 2024 election win, raised $2.5 million last year and ended December with $2.3 million available.
A pro-redistricting campaign group called Fair Maps Indiana Action reported no fundraising activity for 2025 despite announcing in December plans to spend seven figures in key state Senate and House primary races.
Fair Maps Indiana leader Marty Obst, an Indiana Republican operative who held senior leadership roles in Trump’s 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, did not return messages seeking comment Wednesday.
Neither Bray’s office nor the Republican Senate campaign committee commented in response to the new salvos from Trump and Vance.
Merritt said he doubted the redistricting issue’s influence in legislative primary races. 
“If Trump were on the ballot, yes, I think there would be some push,” he said. “I think there’d be some leverage there.”
Secretary of state action
The top 2026 political target for Indiana Democrats is the secretary of state’s office, a race where many party leaders hope Bayh will be able to successfully challenge first-term Republican incumbent Morales.
Bayh, the son of former Gov. Evan Bayh and grandson of former U.S. Sen. Birch Bayh, leveraged those deep political ties for a quick fundraising haul after formally launching his campaign in early October.

In those three months, Beau Bayh raised $1.8 million and ended 2025 with nearly $1.6 million available. 
That compares to the $500,000 raised by Morales for the year and his campaign’s $1.2 million available.
Those figures already put the secretary of state campaigns well ahead of spending for the entire 2022 cycle, when Morales raised $1.3 million and Democratic challenger Destiny Wells raised $860,000.
Beau Bayh’s campaign touted the fundraising haul as evidence of momentum in support of his candidacy.
“People are demanding change — an end to the blatant corruption, an end to the no bid contracts, and an end to the waste of taxpayer money,” he said in a statement. “With the support of more and more Hoosiers on our side, we will defeat Diego Morales.”

The Morales campaign did not reply Wednesday to a request for comment from the Capital Chronicle. Morales has previously criticized Beau Bayh as an “East Coast liberal” for growing up in the Washington area while his father served in the U.S. Senate and attending Harvard for his bachelor’s and law degrees.
The Republican and Democratic nominations for secretary of state will be decided at their state party conventions in June.
Morales is being challenged by Knox County Clerk David Shelton, who reported raising $48,000 and having $7,000 remaining at year’s end.
Another Democratic candidate is Blythe Potter, a small business owner and Army veteran from Bargersville. She reported raising $136,000, with $116,000 available on Dec. 31.
Potter on Wednesday denounced Beau Bayh for relying on what her campaign cited as $310,000 from Republican-aligned donors and $615,000 from out-of-state contributors.
Potter called on Beau Bayh to return a $25,000 contribution from Marc Rowan, the CEO of Apollo Global Management private equity firm whom Trump has named to his planned Board of Peace.
“Hoosiers deserve to know who candidates are really accountable to,” Potter said in a statement. “If Beau Bayh wants to run as a champion for Indiana voters, he should start by returning money from Trump-aligned billionaires who sit on pay-to-play advisory boards and bankroll the Republican agenda.”
Bayh campaign manager Jack Tormoehlen did not comment directly on Blythe’s criticism, saying in a statement that “Beau has been clear about his priorities in cleaning up the corruption in the secretary of state’s office, and we are building a winning campaign with supporters who agree we shouldn’t be wasting taxpayer dollars on no-bid contracts and luxury cars.”

(Photo: Getty Images)(Photo: Getty Images)A portion of Tennessee’s federal grant money from the Trump administration’s Rural Health Transformation Program may depend on state lawmakers’ ability to pass legislation eliminating the certificate of need law — something the Tennessee Hospital Association has resisted for years.
The Joint Ways and Means Committee voted unanimously on Jan. 14 to accept nearly $207 million in federal grant dollars for the grant’s first year, but not without reservations.
Tennessee anticipates receiving up to $1 billion from the program over the next five years, but not all of that funding is guaranteed.
The state will receive $100 million in baseline funding for each of the five years, but additional competitive funds are granted each year based on states’ application strength, alignment with the Trump administration’s goals and “commitment to meaningful reform,” J.W. Randolph, deputy commissioner for population health infrastructure at the Tennessee Department of Health, told the committee.
Tennessee’s application for the program includes several policy commitments, including introducing and passing legislation in 2026 that would:

Eliminate certificate of need across facility categories, to be implemented by Jan. 1, 2027
Enable “full scope of practice” for nurse practitioners and physicians’ assistants, “full authority” for pharmacists, and “unrestricted scope of practice” for dental hygienists by Jan. 1, 2027
Require schools to reestablish the Presidential Fitness Test, with implementation by Dec. 31, 2028
Require nutrition to be a component of continuing medical education for physicians, with implementation by Dec. 31, 2028.

These promises raised concern from Rep. Bud Hulsey, the joint committee’s co-chair, Sen. Bo Watson and Rep. Ryan Williams. 
“Is there a bill in the pipeline, and how are you so sure that the legislature is going to pass it? Because I’ve seen them blow up, more than one time, on the floor,” Hulsey asked. “And if it does not pass, how does that affect the outcome of next year’s money?”
Randolph said no specific legislation has been filed and potential fiscal impacts have not yet been studied. The filing deadline for legislation is Jan. 31.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers the Rural Health Transformation Program, has not “provided a specific rubric to say how much funds we could get in addition from passing those policies … or how much we may lose out on subsequent years,” Randolph said.
He described the grant program’s structure as “an invitation to reform” and said the federal government indicated it would provide more financial support to states that show commitment to transformational change.
“They have indicated that we as a state would be more competitive for more funding through policy change, and that some share of this year’s funding, if policies are not implemented, might be clawed back,” Randolph said.
Certificate of need laws require hospitals or health systems to show community need before establishing or expanding certain health care facilities or services. The law supports nonprofit hospitals by allowing limited competition, so they can use revenue from high-demand services like heart and knee surgeries to subsidize the cost of mandatory charity care. 
But opponents of the law have claimed it restricts competition, and therefore reduces access. HCA Healthcare and the Center for Individual Freedom — a group whose donors are legally anonymous — advocated for the complete repeal of certificate of need in 2024.
Tennessee enacted a partial certificate of need reform law removing restrictions for satellite emergency rooms in counties with existing hospitals that year. The law also made it easier to open a hospital in a county where a hospital does not already exist.
What the money would pay for
Tennessee outlined five focus areas in its application for the program:

Improving access
Maternal and child health
Technology infrastructure
Preventative health and wellness
Workforce development

Gov. Bill Lee’s Rural Healthcare Resiliency Program, a competitive state grant program that has invested more than $300 million of TennCare shared savings dollars since 2023, will be used as a model for funding distribution for competitive grants within those categories. 










(The federal government) have indicated that we as a state would be more competitive for more funding through policy change, and that some share of this year’s funding, if policies are not implemented, might be clawed back.


– J.W. Randolph, Tennessee Department of Health


Initiatives proposed in the application include several competitive grants within each category, a Last Mile Initiative for emergency medical services, expanding Tennessee’s Safety Net program, creating a Memory Care Assessment Network, a dental pilot extension, technical assistance investments and a $100 million expansion of value-based payments led by TennCare for hospitals as well as maternity and dental care in rural areas.
Value-based care focuses on patients’ overall health with the goal of coordinating across practices and doctors, improving patient experience and helping patients avoid hospital stays and trips to emergency departments.
It’s not clear which portions of Tennessee’s plan for the Rural Health Transformation grant would be reduced or eliminated should Tennessee not receive all of the anticipated $1 billion in federal funding.
Rural Health Transformation Program funds cannot be used for construction (anything that requires permits), clinician salaries, loan repayment, hospital operating deficits or historical debt. There are restrictions on payments for providers, and the funding cannot be used for higher reimbursement rates.
The first tranche of funding would need to be expended by Sept. 30, 2027.
Rep. Ryan Williams, a Cookeville Republican, noted the closure of rural hospitals over the last decade. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Williams, a Cookeville Republican, asked if the funding could help raise reimbursement rates for rural providers.
“We know that expenses in rural communities look different than they do in metropolitan areas, so as we think about the value-based payment approach, we really believe that the funds can be used to drive better health outcomes and paying for those types of services, whether it’s infrastructure, whether it’s around the way that they serve members that are TennCare, will result in more dollars going to those providers that won’t be going through a provider rate increase,” TennCare Chief Medical Officer Victor Wu said.
Williams and Watson said the plan does not seem “transformational” to them. Williams added that payor mix — the breakdown of revenue from different medical insurance payors — is key in rural health care. 
Smaller hospitals tend to rely more on Medicare and Medicaid payments than larger hospitals, which tend to have a higher percentage of commercial or private insurance payors and self-pay patients.
“I think it’s really important for us to know that the reason why we moved to licensure and payor mix is because it is the last best effort for us to provide some kind of protection for those small rural hospitals, of which 75% have disappeared under this administration,” Williams said.
The Rural Health Transformation grant program is a result of $50 billion earmarked in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act for rural healthcare over the next five years. The budget act is also expected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over the next decade. The act’s changes to Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces and Medicare and policy interactions are expected to increase the number of people without health insurance in 2034 by 10 million, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Tennessee is projected to see roughly 68,000 more uninsured residents by 2034, according to estimates published by KFF Health News. The majority — 40,000 people — would become uninsured due to changes in the ACA Marketplace, while 24,000 people would lose insurance due to Medicaid changes.

(Getty Images)With monthly premiums spiking for many, about 10,000 fewer West Virginians signed up for health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act’s healthcare.gov marketplace this year compared to last, according to preliminary data released this week by the federal government.
As of the first week of January, 55,127 state residents had either enrolled or were automatically re-enrolled in health insurance plans on the health insurance marketplace. As of the same time in 2025, that number was 64,818, according to a spokesperson for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. 
Enhanced tax credits that made the plans affordable, expired Dec. 31, 2025, leading to a spike in the cost of premiums for 2026 plans. 
Ellen Allen, executive director of West Virginians for Affordable Health Care, said the nearly 15% drop in enrollment is unsurprising. 
“West Virginians simply can’t afford 200%, 300% and even higher premium increases,” Allen said. “It’s very unfortunate and we’ll likely see more people drop out who were betting on Congressional action in the new year.” 
According to an analysis by the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, West Virginia households of all sizes and incomes saw dramatic spikes in their monthly premiums for healthcare.gov plans. In some cases, the premiums for the same plan in 2026 increased tenfold. Households in the state on average saw their premiums increase by more than half, increasing by 133%. Older families and those who earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level were most impacted. The latter lost their subsidies altogether.
The enhanced tax credits were at the center of a congressional fight that led to a government shutdown that lasted more than a month last fall. Democrats in Congress wanted to extend the credits past their end-of-the-year deadline. Congress still has not reached an agreement to extend the tax credits.
Across the country, the number of people buying 2026 plans on the marketplace was down by about 833,000, according to reporting by States Newsroom. 
People had until Jan. 15 to sign up for 2026 plans on the Marketplace. Jeremy Smith, program director for First Choice Services, which runs the state’s Affordable Care Act navigator program, said most people sign up for plans before Dec. 15, which is required for coverage to begin on Jan. 1. On Dec. 16, people enrolled in plans last year are automatically re-enrolled in plans for the next year, he said. 
Smith said of the people First Choice Services helped enroll, about one in four people were dropping their plans. Another 25% switched their coverage to one with a higher deductible just so they could afford it to keep insurance, he said.
“A lot of people, they really had to dig in this year and make a hard decision whether they were going to keep it or whether they were going to switch into a plan that they could maybe make the monthly payment,” Smith said. “But then all of a sudden their deductibles and co-pays are way out of reach, too. But that’s kind of the trend that we saw as far as the people we helped.”
The enhanced tax credits were first made available through the American Rescue Plan of 2021 and extended through the Inflation Reduction Act to the end of 2025 
In a statement, Kelly Allen, director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said state workers, business owners and families who rely on the marketplace had to make painful trade offs this year with the expiration of enhanced subsidies.
“Some are going without health insurance altogether while others are going without other basics to offset huge spikes in their premiums,” she said.
Allen said a fuller sense of the impact of the subsidies expiring will be known after West Virginia families make their first payments to make their plans effective. 
“All that said, we are hopeful Congress will take action to extend the enrollment period and reinstate these subsidies that make health insurance accessible and affordable for tens of thousands of West Virginians in time for the rest of 2026,” Allen said.

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)As local units of government report an influx of time-consuming public records requests they suspect of being phishing attempts, Hoosier lawmakers are cracking down.
“This bill addresses a real and emerging threat that is happening largely out of public view,” said John Wilson, representing the Allen County Board of Commissioners.
“This threat is the large-scale harvesting of government data, often by bots or AI-driven systems outside of our state,” he told the House’s government committee Wednesday.

Wilson described how the county received a commercial public records request seeking a spreadsheet of every purchase from 2021 to the present, including unit pricing, vendor IDs, quantities, totals and more — in the requester’s own format.
“We don’t think this is a request for transparency. We think this is a request to replicate our internal purchasing system,” he said. “If I’m someone committing fraud, I want to appear as legitimate as possible. A unit of government is about as legitimate as it gets.”
Other requests, per Wilson, sought 10 years worth of purchase orders above a certain threshold and, also in the requester’s own format, internal capital planning information “across nearly every category of public infrastructure.”
After an amendment taken Wednesday, House Bill 1360 would allow — but not require — state and local public agencies to set up online public records portals distinguishing bots from humans and Hoosiers from out-of-staters.
A portal could incorporate CAPTCHAs or other mechanisms to ensure a requester is human, and log submissions suspected of being automated or “to have originated from known sources of phishing or data scraping.” 
Those logs would get reported to the Office of the Public Access Counselor. The PAC would also track requests to identify patterns or sources of such “suspect” requests.

A portal could also require verification of a requester’s physical address and indicate to the public agency if the requester is an Indiana resident.
A public agency would be able to charge supplemental fees to out-of-state requesters — capped at 25 cents per page or $25 per staff hour — and to prioritize asks filed by Indiana residents and for non-commercial uses.
Those would include civic, journalistic, academic or personal purposes.
“When non-Hoosiers and non-humans consume our resources, both the state and the local government should be able to recoup these costs,” Allen County’s Wilson said.
“Some of these out of state requests are legitimate …” he added. “But many (have) fake names, (from) companies that don’t show up when you Google them.”
The bill’s author, Rep. Matt Lehman, said the measure isn’t meant to hurt journalistic data-gathering efforts by out-of-state outlets or  using automated tools. He noted Hoosier agencies can waive fees if they determine a request serves the public interest.
“You have to be able to make your argument as to why … gathering the data is journalistic,” Lehman, R-Berne, told the Capital Chronicle. “So if you say, ‘Look, I’m getting 50 states data on this particular thing to write a story,’ I think that makes sense.”

(David Sacks/Getty Images)Louisiana started moving 330,000 Medicaid recipients last week out of insurance plans UnitedHealthcare offers at the direction of Attorney General Liz Murrill, who is suing the company. 
The Louisiana Department of Health opened up a special, monthlong re-enrollment period Jan. 15 for all Medicaid recipients with UnitedHealthcare plans. They have until Feb. 15 to sign up for health insurance with one of the five remaining companies in the state’s Medicaid program. If they don’t pick a new insurer by that deadline, the health department will automatically assign them to a new plan starting April 1. 
State Medicaid Director Seth Gold said his office has sent out at least one notice to every UnitedHealthcare enrollee informing them their health care plan won’t be offered after March 31. 
“We’re trying to provide as much flexibility and opportunity for our United members,” Gold said Wednesday at a health care summit Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration organized.
AmeriHealth Caritas, Aetna, Elevance Health, Humana and Louisiana Healthcare Connections are the other companies that will continue to provide Medicaid plans in the state.
A little over 1.5 million people in Louisiana, about a third of its population, receive health insurance through Medicaid, a government-backed program funded mostly with federal money. Those who qualify include low-income citizens, pregnant people and those with disabilities. 

In December, the state health department abruptly announced it would be pulling back from a $4.2 billion contract with UnitedHealthcare to provide Medicaid coverage throughout 2026. State officials have not said how much of that $4.2 billion contract, one of the largest in state history, will be paid to the company to cover the truncated timeline. 
With 330,000 enrollees, UnitedHealthcare was the second largest private plan in Medicaid at the end of last year. 
Murrill directed the health department to cancel the UnitedHealthcare contract because the company refused to provide documents to her office about its prescription drug pricing for Medicaid, she said. The attorney general has alleged UnitedHealthcare overcharged the state for prescription drugs and asked for the information as part of the lawsuit brought on behalf of the state. 
The canceled contract took Louisiana state lawmakers by surprise, however. 
Landry initially filed the lawsuit against UnitedHealthcare in 2022 when he was attorney general, and it’s unclear why the contract termination is happening at this moment. 
In late November, the Landry administration asked legislators to sign off on a yearlong contract with UnitedHealthcare before terminating the arrangement less than two weeks later.

Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein said Louisiana would be willing to continue working with UnitedHealthcare if the company and Murrill reach an agreement over their legal dispute in the next few weeks. 

“United is not out yet,” Greenstein said. “There is still an opportunity for the plan/corporation to meet the requirements of the attorney general and resolve their dispute.”
Reaching a consensus seems unlikely. The attorney general’s office said  Wednesday afternoon there had been “no change” in its standoff with UnitedHealthcare. State Rep. Dustin Miller, D-Opelousas, who leads the Louisiana House Health and Welfare Committee, said UnitedHealthcare is not interested in participating in the Medicaid program anymore. 

“United is not interested in coming to the table. They are out,” Miller said in an interview Wednesday. 
When moving UnitedHealthcare recipients into new plans this spring, Greenstein and Gold said the state will prioritize keeping families together with one health insurer. They will also try to move people to plans their doctors and medical providers already accept when possible. 

Louisiana will also provide more flexibility to Medicaid enrollees who want to switch plans in general. Starting in March, any Medicaid recipient will be allowed to switch plans twice during the calendar year at any time. They will no longer have to wait until an open enrollment period in the fall to move to a different insurer, Gold said. 

The new flexibility with Medicaid enrollment is expected to save the state money. Louisiana will no longer have to hire as many insurance brokers and ramp up marketing for an open enrollment period that less than 3% of Medicaid enrollees were using to switch plans anyway, Gold said.

Blaine Halverson joked that his only exposure to data centers was from the Mission Impossible movies in the 1990s. That was, until one came to his town. Over the last seven months, Halverson’s community of Menomonie, Wisconsin, population 16,700, has become a flashpoint in a growing debate over data center development and local control in the state.
Halverson has lived in Menomonie, which is just over an hour east of Minneapolis, for most of his life. Like many others in his rural community, Halverson didn’t know much about the hyperscale data centers, built by the world’s largest technology companies, that are cropping up across the U.S. to power artificial intelligence. Then, in July 2025, Halverson was on vacation with his wife when he learned of a $1.6 billion data center proposal slated for around 320 acres of farmland on the outskirts of Menomonie.
Immediately, Halverson had questions.
“All of a sudden, I was activated,” said Halverson. “What really activated me was how far along this was, and that the public was just finding out.”
Over the next six months, Halverson and dozens of other concerned Menomonie residents coordinated a local opposition campaign that on January 5, 2026, resulted in Menomonie’s City Council revising a zoning ordinance to bar Balloonist, LLC, the developer representing an undisclosed ‘tech giant’, from moving ahead on construction. 
An attorney for Balloonist LLC did not respond to the Daily Yonder’s request for comment.
In Port Washington, Wisconsin, many residents oppose a $15 billion data center campus that’s currently under construction for end-users Oracle and OpenAI. (No Data Centers in Ozaukee County Facebook group)
Halverson’s frustration about the project’s lack of transparency is one that has echoed throughout the state. In other rural counties and in villages sandwiched between larger cities like Milwaukee, Madison, and Green Bay, data center proposals in places like Beaver Dam, Port Washington, and Caledonia have been met with fierce opposition from residents. Developers eyeing land in Greenleaf, a village outside of Green Bay, and in Grant County, which borders the Mississippi River, have also faced community backlash. Commonly cited concerns revolve around project secrecy and the data centers’ projected energy usage, water needs, and financial impact on communities with small tax bases.
Beyond requiring vast amounts of power and water to keep operations running 24/7, large data center proposals in rural areas often represent a significant, if not dominant, share of the community’s tax levy. This leaves residents fearing what will happen if the planned data centers do not live up to their promises, should the stock market take a turn, the developers go bankrupt, or the technology inside the warehouse-like structures become obsolete. 
“They’re not seeing the long-term risks,” said Prescott Balch about the elected officials who push for data center development in Wisconsin’s rural communities. Balch is a retired software developer and former technology executive at U.S. Bank. He also lives in Caledonia, Wisconsin, a rural village south of Milwaukee whose residents ousted a 244-acre Microsoft data center that was slated for land zoned for agriculture in October of 2025. 
“No investment advisor, for example, would ever let you do [that] with your investment portfolio. They’d get fired for saying, ‘Put all your eggs in this one basket.’ It doesn’t matter how solid that one basket is. It’s still one basket with a lot of risk if it walks out the door,” Balch said. 
A hot spot
Over the last year, rural Wisconsin has become somewhat of a hotspot for data center developers. The allure for Big Tech companies racing to build infrastructure to train and run complex AI models comes in the form of tax incentives, low-cost land, and, in many rural communities, flexible zoning codes. 
But residents like Halverson and Balch are taking notice and starting to organize together. Opposition groups that have formed in communities faced with data center proposals are using digital tools like Facebook and Signal to connect with one another across the Badger State. Now, a growing coalition of rural residents and environmental organizations are urging state legislators to regulate data center development and, in some instances, taking legal action to improve transparency. 
The debate over Wisconsin’s data center boom is both rooted in local governance and relevant to the national conversation about rising electricity costs. In an election year, data center infrastructure has become a political issue, yet it’s one that rural coalition members insist is nonpartisan. What’s on the ballot, including a crowded gubernatorial race, could influence that. 
Why Wisconsin?

To grasp why data centers are coming to Wisconsin, you have to understand a particularly wonky part of the state’s tax code, according to Port Washington resident Michael Beaster. A resident of the rural city just north of Milwaukee, Beaster opposes the $15 billion campus being built by Vantage Data Centers to serve end-users Oracle and OpenAI as part of their $500 billion Stargate campaign to develop AI infrastructure across the U.S.
The wonky policy Beaster is talking about is a tax incremental district, or TID.
In Wisconsin, a TID lets developers pay their property taxes into a separate box from the rest of the community as a way to capture property value growth associated with new projects. During construction, a developer, like Vantage, contributes taxes to this special box to cover infrastructure costs associated with their project, like new roads and power lines. Depending on the terms of the TID, that tax money is then kept in the box until all infrastructure costs have been paid, often a period of 15-20 years.
Typically, this kind of tax policy helps small- or medium-scale developers, like new packing plants or housing developments, pay for their associated infrastructure costs over time. With hyperscale data centers, however, rural residents worry that the high costs of the developments’ power and water infrastructure will rack up for the community to pay while the developers’ taxes sit in a special box. 
“If the village decides to raise the tax levy, it comes off the backs of the current residents only, and that is completely and utterly invisible right now to most people,” said Balch, who worked to reject Microsoft’s proposed data center campus in Caledonia last fall.
Residents gathered on November 4, 2025 for a Common Council Meeting in Port Washington, Wisconsin, where the city voted to create a tax incremental district (TID) for Oracle and OpenAI’s data center complex. The meeting was held in a local hotel ballroom to accommodate the large showing of community members. (Brian Slawson)
In November of 2025, the city of Port Washington approved a TID that enables Vantage to pay upfront for the estimated $175 million in infrastructure costs, plus $91 million for an electrical substation and $187 million in interest, associated with their data center campus, including upgraded water and sewer mains and new power infrastructure. Port Washington will then be responsible for paying Vantage back for those infrastructure costs over time.
The TID is set up as a pool of money to remain open for up to 20 years for the city to draw from to reimburse Vantage. Some residents, including Beaster, have expressed concerns that the financing model could end up raising taxes for locals. On January 2, 2026, a Port Washington-based group of activists filed a lawsuit against the city to challenge the TID.
“People don’t want to see their communities handed over to large corporations,” Beaster said.
Port Washington Mayor Ted Neitzke did not respond to the Daily Yonder’s request for clarification on whether the city’s TID would result in higher taxes for residents.
Last summer, a bipartisan measure in Wisconsin’s legislature updated the state’s tax incremental financing policy to exempt data centers from caps on the amount of money that can be held in a TID. The act mentions both Port Washington and Beaver Dam by name and was signed into law by Democratic Governor Tony Evers on July 8, 2025. In addition to TIDs, Wisconsin also offers a sales and use tax exemption to incentivize data center development. The exemptions are offered on a ladder based on a developer’s intended investment and the host county’s population, with less populous counties requiring less investment. For rural counties, the minimum investment required to claim the exemption is $50 million. 
For Asad Ramzanali, former deputy director for strategy at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under the Biden Administration, it is this kind of policy that goes against the idea that data centers should have to pay their “fair share”.
“When the largest companies, the most well-resourced companies, in the history of the world are behind these data centers, it feels particularly unfair to have states level tax breaks for construction,” Ramzanali told the Daily Yonder.
“People should not have to pay increased utility bills. People should not have to pay for transmission lines going up, [and] people shouldn’t have to deal with dirty water sources because of a data center.”
Nonpartisan, but political
With local pushback to data centers picking up steam, state legislators are taking note. Beaster said that’s a change from the attitude that some legislators had a few months ago, when his rural community members were mobilizing against the data center in Port Washington last summer and fall. 
“When we started really getting involved in trying to mobilize, we tried to write letters and emails and stuff to state legislators, and they just weren’t very responsive,” Beaster said. “It felt to us like they were more interested in bringing these things here than regulating them.”

In early December, 2025, Democrats introduced a bill to regulate data centers and entice them to take climate-friendly steps. Under the proposed legislation, residents would be protected from footing the utility costs associated with data centers. If passed, the bill would also subject data centers to an annual fee, ranging from $2-3 million, to fund clean energy and low-income heating assistance programs. The legislation also includes a measure to hinge state tax incentives, like the sales and use tax exemption, upon data centers using at least 70% renewable energy. 
In January, 2025, Republicans introduced a data center bill of their own, with similarities including mandated reporting on water usage and restrictions on passing development-related utility costs onto families and small businesses. The Republican legislation would also mandate that data centers wanting to use renewable energy would need to build those energy sources, like solar, on the same property. 
The utility provisions in both the Democrat and Republican-backed bills come as the Wisconsin Public Service Commission (PSC) prepares to hear a case in February of 2026, from We Energies, the state’s largest utility, that will determine how much data centers will have to pay for their infrastructure, and how much gets passed onto other ratepayers. 
We Energies has requested a pay structure that holds data centers accountable for 75% of their capital costs. That request has been challenged by the Wisconsin chapter of the Sierra Club, which argues large customers like data centers should be held responsible for 100% of their associated costs.
“This is the decision for how much the largest utility is making large customers pay, and right now the proposal is really bad for an average residential customer,” said Cassie Steiner, a senior campaign coordinator at Sierra Club. The PSC is expected to hand down a decision on the 2026 rate structure in the spring. 
Even as data center regulation captures lawmakers’ attention at the state capitol in Madison, organizers in Menomonie, Port Washington, and Caledonia maintain that local opposition isn’t tied to party. 
“One of the things that has been really amazing to me about this process is that I know the people I’m standing shoulder-to-shoulder with in this group, a lot of them never vote the same way I would when we go into the into the voting booth in November,” Halverson said of his work in Menomonie. 
“If it’s your farmland and your community, you’re an extreme environmentalist, and if it’s your power bill going up, then you’re a fiscal conservative.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LEDE_Menomonie_1-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-22 06:36:17.645083

(Photo: Mario Villafuerte/Getty Images)The Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security is requiring about 8,800 commercial drivers’ license holders to provide in-person proof of citizenship or lawful permanent residence by April 6, department officials told lawmakers Wednesday.
The requirement aligns with the directives by the Trump administration that target non-citizen commercial drivers.
In April, the president issued an executive order mandating English proficiency requirements for commercial licenses. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in June announced a nationwide audit of states that issue commercial licenses to non-state residents. Tennessee law does not permit those who are not residents of Tennessee to obtain commercial licenses.
In August, the State Department paused work visas for non-U.S. residents seeking to fill the demand for truck drivers. Then, in September, the federal government announced it was fast-tracking a new rule that would revoke the existing licenses of immigrants with a variety of temporary legal statuses.
Russell Shoup, assistant commissioner for the Department of Safety and Homeland Security, said his agency had audited its records following Trump’s executive order, finding that 8,800 of Tennessee’s 150,000 commercial license holders did not have proof of citizenship or lawful permanent residence in their files. 
State law already requires that applicants provide proof of their citizenship or immigration status. Shoup said that the 8,800 drivers likely showed proof to obtain their license, but prior to 2001 state officials did not hold onto the documentation.
“Before 2001 we were asking for that documentation but we didn’t necessarily have it in our files,” he said. 
Letters went out earlier this month notifying affected drivers, he said. About 1,000 drivers have already brought in their documentation, he said. 
Shoup said commercial drivers who come to state motor vehicle offices to provide documentation will be moved to the front of the line. 
“We know this is an inconvenience,” he said.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
A video obtained by Mississippi Today confirms oral and documented accounts that a guard at the Rankin County Adult Detention Center punched an inmate so hard that he broke the inmate’s jaw.
The video, captured by security cameras inside the Rankin County jail, shows guard Jordan McQueary striking an inmate, Dustin Rives, during his 2022 stay in the jail. Medical records show that Rives, whose jaw was fractured, did not receive treatment until 25 days after the incident, by which time he had developed a deep infection that required surgery.
Mississippi Today and The New York Times previously uncovered allegations of widespread violence in the jail involving the use of favored inmates, known as “trusties,” as enforcers, and a culture of brutality condoned and encouraged by top officials.
The Justice Department has been investigating the patterns and practices of the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department, which runs the jail, since its deputies’ 2023 shooting of a Black man. Mississippi Today and The Times documented a reign of terror by deputies for nearly 20 years.
When the publications asked the department for this video in August, they responded, “The requested date is beyond the record retention date for videos and, upon best information and belief, such video is not available for production.” It was one of 10 videos the publications requested in 2025 and did not receive. The department did not respond to multiple requests for its retention schedule.
“There is a public interest in prosecuting crimes, and there is a public interest in purging people who commit crimes from their jobs,” said Matt Steffey, a professor of criminal law and evidence at the Mississippi College School of Law. In the absence of a criminal investigation or a lawsuit, while there may not be a legal requirement for the department to retain video evidence beyond their retention schedule, “They should, as a matter of sensible administration of a public body,” Steffey said.
Mississippi Today obtained the video from Rives’ family, who acquired it through an attorney’s office.
Jason Dare, the attorney for the sheriff’s department, said McQueary’s “single slap in response to Rives (1) calling a female jailer a “b****”, (2) threatened to punch her,  then (3) raising his right fist to follow through with his threats” appeared to be constitutionally permissible, and that Rives received medical attention within five minutes of the incident and was X-rayed within 24 hours. 
Rives’ complaint acknowledged that a nurse had checked his vitals soon after the incident, and that he had been X-rayed. A report written 17 days after the incident by a nurse in the jail says Rives was being given Naproxen, which is used to manage pain. Medical records show that he was not taken to the hospital until 25 days after the incident. 
McQueary, the guard in the video who is seen punching Rives, has been named in complaints or federal lawsuits by at least nine inmates who allege he assaulted them. He is still employed by the department and was honored in 2024 for his “outstanding” work in the jail. McQueary declined to comment and redirected reporters to the department’s attorney.
While being held in the male detox cell on July 18, 2022, Rives began “yelling and screaming that he wanted his medicine,” McQueary wrote in his report.
Rives wrote in a complaint he filed a month later that when he went to the restroom, he was urinating blood. “I yelled for help and officers and trustees came cursing and threatening me,” he wrote. “I turned to point at blood.” Rives said the medication he was asking for included his antidepressants, antibiotics and pain medicine. 
The video shows a group of guards and a trusty rushing to the cell. A shouting match ensues.
McQueary quoted Rives as saying to a female guard, “Shut up, bitch, before I punch you in the face.” Rives admitted to using that language, but said it was directed at the male trusty who accompanied the guards, not the female guard. 
McQueary then lunges and punches Rives in the face, knocking him to the ground. 
On reviewing the incident, David Fathi, the director of the National Prison Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, said punching a detainee could only be justified in self-defense, which was not the case according to the guard’s own report.
“There is no indication that when the incident started, the detainee was doing anything other than yelling and screaming,” Fathi said. “Putting aside the way he was expressing himself, asking for medicine is a reasonable and appropriate request. They could have had someone from medical talk to him, or they could have just left him alone. Instead, the officers escalated the situation into what ended up being a very dangerous use of force.”
About a minute and a half after punching Rives, McQueary can be seen escorting him away with his hands behind his back. Rives’ pants have been pulled down, exposing his genitals. “I was begging them to pull up my pants,” Rives wrote. “They laughed and said they wouldn’t.”
“If his pants had been pulled down, they should have pulled them back up before parading him through the jail in front of other people,” said Fathi. “That kind of gratuitous humiliation is completely unjustifiable.” 
Jail incident reports show that instead of being taken to a hospital, Rives, whose jaw was fractured, was strapped into a restraint chair overnight and then locked in an isolation cell for 25 days. “I got real sick,” he said.
By the time he was hospitalized, medical records show, his jaw was infected and required surgery, including the removal of a tooth.
Rives was one of eight inmates who filed grievances in the jail between 2018 to 2022, describing assaults by guards or trusties.
Rives’ grievance file shows that a supervisor closed his complaint three days after he filed it, saying the department had provided a “satisfactory response,” which included scheduling a medical appointment for Rives and informing him of his right to press criminal charges against McQueary after he was released from the jail. The report does not indicate whether McQueary was disciplined or questioned about the incident. 
Rives said the department never contacted him again.
He also said his broken jaw never fully healed. “They’re still hurting people,” Rives said. “I just want to make sure that can’t happen again.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/21165515/Screenshot-2026-01-20-at-11.59.11-AM.jpg,,,2026-01-22 06:36:17.645083

Data has become the currency of the globalized digitally integrated realm, and trying to understand that data in the concise, short, visual format more and more people demand on their platforms means statistics. Lots of them. 
Dominated by algorithms — fancy terms for statistics and data computations — that tailor the information and data we are all inhaling digitally. Health care, politics, education, anything involving complex issues gets compressed into a data set for public consumption. And, since the interpretation of that data can be creatively controlled to find a statistic to say anything about any topic, statistics is the tool of choice of news media, content creators, academics, reporters, consumers, commentators… statistics are becoming the universal medium for discourse. 
Not always for good. The late, great wordsmith Vin Scully correctly observed, “Statistics are used much like a drunk uses a lamppost: for support, not illumination.” I’m guilty as well. I’ve crutched some iffy prose up to its feet with some statistical shenanigans in my writing career. Those who have never once been tempted to put the best-looking number at the top of the PowerPoint slide or email, cast the first stone.
Which means statistics are also becoming white noise that blends into the news cycles as numbers and visual graphics alone do not have the impact they might otherwise have. A national debt in tens of trillions of dollars is not a number that gets any attention or traction because it is a not relatable, farcical number. Crime stats waved like a bloody shirt for those wanting to rail against them, while the same set of numbers can be manipulated to show crime is down for those in charge. The statistics of those killed, maimed and left with ruined lives worldwide only seem to make a debt in the American news consumer who cares about a specific people group in a specific place for the most part, and to our shame. 
Medical statistics can be even more formidable, combining raw numbers with complex nomenclature of personal issues most would rather not discuss in public even if they could pronounce all the words. I’ve read for several years covering other health care issues and how things like early onset colorectal cancers are exploding, not just in America but worldwide, among younger and younger folks. 
It became personal when a friend and young mother from my church was diagnosed with Stage 4 colorectal cancer in her early 30s, and when a family member died after years of health issues stemming from a colon cancer diagnosis that was not immediately and aggressively treated. But mostly those were stats somewhere in the background noise of all the other statistics that I assault my brain with. 
Until my own doctor called to tell me I have colorectal cancer, it was invasive, and we needed to be aggressive in response. 
The standard for getting colonoscopies is 45 years old unless you have mitigating factors. Which I have. I have been getting colonoscopies for years, usually paired with one of the scores of endoscopies I’ve had with all my GI issues over the years. But here I am, a statistic in the under 50 early onset colorectal cancer story. Statistics did not find my cancer, my amazing doctor being on top of his game did, making sure I got the procedure that found cancer that otherwise would not have been found until much later, possibly, probably too much later. 
Knowledge that this type of cancer in my age cohort is feared to double in the next five years does not really shed light on my current situation. The information that while this type is increasing by 1 to 2% yearly for adults under 50 couples with the knowledge the disease is now a leading cause of death for men and second leading cause of death for women under 50 is sobering. The statistics that the five-year relative survival rate is 64-65% in America, but jumps up over 90% if caught early and remaining confined to the colon or rectum, is news folks can use and be heartened by. 
At the core of this statistical dispensation of time we live in, especially digitally, is a need to simplify a complex world so we can understand it quickly with minimal effort in a relatable way. Those efforts are fated to find the world is too big to quantify, so most folks settle for measuring what we can understand. That little bit of purposeful disconnect is where much of our news and information economy is living at the moment, measuring only what we understand and can reach, awash in statistics and opinions thusly self-constrained. 
Unless, and mostly inevitably until, you yourself become the statistic and your news and information world gets recalibrated. Which mine did. I have an exceptional team of doctors, a loving family and friend network, and tremendous support from all sorts of places. The statistic I am focused on is being in the group that fights cancer off to the side and goes on to other things. As I do those other things, I will take the lesson of respecting statistics I did not pay enough attention to while being thankful my doctors did. And learn from it. And tell others to get their medical screenings and tests, and be more discerning of the news cycle, and be as prepared as you can be for whatever statistic you might find yourself becoming.

The state Court of Judicial Discipline (CJD) suspended Philadelphia Family Court Judge Mark B. Cohen in October 2024 after a trial on whether his Facebook posts violated the state constitution and rules of conduct for judges.
The dozens of questioned posts included Cohen’s views about former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, the hammer attack on former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Gov. Josh Shapiro’s election and other state and national political issues.
In an opinion Wednesday, Justice Kevin Dougherty wrote the CJD correctly found that unless a judge is running for retention, their right to free speech must be balanced against the interests of the courts in protecting the independence, integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.
“Judge Cohen did not put just his own reputation at risk,” Dougherty wrote. “When, as here, a sitting judge adopts the persona of a political party spokesperson and abuses the prestige of his office to advance that party’s interests, he detracts from the reputation of the entire judiciary.”

The case sets a new standard in the commonwealth for limits on judges’ speech outside the context of their own political campaigns. 
Judicial candidates generally have freedom to speak about their qualifications for office or in opposition to other candidates. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2002 established that to limit judicial candidates’ speech, the government’s restrictions must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest, known as a “strict scrutiny” test.
Cohen’s lawyer, Samuel Stretton of West Chester, said he argued that the test should be applied to Cohen’s case. He noted Cohen served 42 years in the state House and is a member of a respected Philadelphia political family.
“It’s very important for a judge to have the right to be involved in issues that don’t come before them or their colleagues,” Stretton said, adding that Cohen is considering whether to seek an appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court.
The state Judicial Conduct Board (JCB), which investigates and prosecutes allegations of ethical violations by judges, pursued the charges against Cohen. Attorneys on the case could not be reached for comment late Wednesday.
According to Dougherty’s opinion, Cohen created his Facebook page as a state representative in 2007 and continued posting after he was elected to the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas in 2018.
His posts came to the attention of the family court’s then-Administrative Judge Margaret Murphy when she received a citizen’s complaint claiming one of Cohen’s posts was racist. That complaint proved unfounded, according to the opinion, but Murphy complained about some of Cohen’s other posts, including a picture of himself wearing robes on the bench and a post boasting about his consistent “F” rating from the National Rifle Association as a lawmaker.
After meeting with Murphy and then-President Judge Idee Fox, Cohen agreed to take down the photo as well as the post that triggered the initial complaint. But when Cohen continued to post regularly, Murphy reported the posts to the JCB.
In his decision, Dougherty drew from a federal appeals court’s decision in the case of a Wisconsin judge who challenged that state’s Code of Judicial Conduct barring him from identifying himself as an “active member of the Democratic party” and endorsing other partisan candidates for office.
In that case, Dougherty wrote, the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals drew a dividing line between speech about the judge’s own campaign and his “entry into the political arena on behalf of his partisan comrades.”
It explained candidates’ speech about their qualifications is “at the core of our First Amendment freedoms.” 
“An endorsement, by contrast, ‘is less a judge’s communication about his qualifications and beliefs than an effort to affect a separate political campaign, or even more problematically, assume a role as political powerbroker,’” Dougherty wrote.
The balancing test employed in the Wisconsin case and adopted by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court requires two determinations to determine whether a sitting judge’s speech may be limited. The first is whether the speech addresses a matter of public concern. The second is the balance between the state’s interest and the judge’s.
Dougherty wrote there was no question about the first determination. On the second, he outlined the CJD’s concerns “not just that Judge Cohen publicly posted his personal, political views, but that he posted so regularly and one-sidedly that he appeared to be ‘an advocate for the Democratic Party.’” 
Cohen advocated for legislation “being promoted by the Democratic Party, cheered on Democratic politicians, impliedly endorsed a candidate for congressional office, touted his own legislative achievements as a Democrat, and criticized the policies of predominately Republican legislatures,” Dougherty said. 
He noted the problem was compounded by Cohen’s identification of himself as a judge in pictures and in text on the page “erasing any chance readers would not connect the dots between his account and the judiciary.”
“When viewed in that light, the question before us is an easy one to resolve. The Commonwealth’s interest in protecting the efficiency of the administration of justice, including the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary, outweighed Judge Cohen’s interest in continuing to act as a spokesperson for the Democratic Party after he took the bench,” Dougherty wrote.
Justice David Wecht filed a concurring opinion in which he argued a judge’s recitation of accomplishments in another elected office is not, by itself, problematic. Justice Daniel McCaffery, who was also a Philadelphia judge, did not participate in the appeal.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/IMG_3772-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-22 05:57:41.013063

Dan McKee framed his proposed rollbacks of green energy incentives around affordability — saving Rhode Island ratepayers $1 billion in their energy bills over the next five years, according to analysis by the state budget office.
Tina Munter, Rhode Island policy advocate for Green Energy Consumers Alliance, offered a different summation of the governor’s fiscal 2027 budget proposal on energy bill charges.
“It’s mind-boggling,” Munter said in a recent interview. “Rhode Island’s reliance on natural gas for heating and electricity is what keeps the region in flux with energy prices. The longer we rely on natural gas, the longer we’re stuck in a cycle of seeing [energy] bills spike, seeing ratepayers be confused and shocked and surprised, versus having more stability.”
This logic persuaded lawmakers in 2022 to enact the most ambitious renewable electricity timeline of any state in the nation. The Renewable Energy Standard law, heralded by McKee at the time of its passage, required Rhode Island to gradually transition to entirely renewable energy sources for its electricity needs, reaching 100% by 2033. 
Now, McKee wants to push the deadline to 2050, which is the same deadline for the state to achieve net-zero emissions overall under the separate Act on Climate law. The proposed 17-year postponement, with immediate relaxation of existing incremental benchmarks, accounts for more than half of the $1 billion projected savings to Rhode Island ratepayers, cutting nearly $64 million from bills in 2027, and $572 million over the next five years, according to the state Office of Management and Budget.

McKee’s environmental and energy administrators defended the rollback, which mirrors policies set by neighboring states and reflects the hostile energy environment under President Donald Trump. 
“At a time when utility bills are already at historic highs and affordability is top concern for Rhode Islanders, President Trump’s actions are raising costs and undermining clean energy production,” Chris Kearns, acting state energy commissioner, said during a Jan. 15 briefing with reporters about McKee’s budget.
Changing winds in Washington have hit Rhode Island hard under the first year of Trump’s second term. Twice, the Trump administration has suspended work on its signature offshore wind project, Revolution Wind; the second federal suspension was lifted by court order on Jan. 12. Repeals of federal electric vehicle tax credits cut $900 million in incentives for Rhode Island motorists, while other key policies governing power emissions and vehicle efficiency standards have been rolled back. 
A $49 million state grant under the Biden administration to help low and moderate-income homeowners and renters afford solar panels remains frozen, tied up in litigation. A separate $30 million federal award for home energy efficiency rebates, announced in 2024, is still awaiting final approval from federal regulators to launch, Kearns said.

The cost of going green
Even before the state’s climate change plan was cast into doubt by a Trump presidency, its ambitious “greening” of the local electricity grid was growing pricier. 
In 2023, the most recent year available, electricity suppliers, including Rhode Island Energy, spent nearly $60 million to meet the 23% renewable electricity requirement for the year, according to a November 2025 report submitted to state regulators. The cost includes purchasing credits from regional solar, wind and other clean energy projects, which can be substituted for new renewable energy production to meet the mandates. Five years prior, when electricity suppliers only had to meet a 13% clean electricity standard, total program spending was less than $8 million.
The spending is passed on to ratepayers, reflected on the “delivery details” portion of Rhode Island Energy’s monthly billing along with other state mandated fees and energy program costs. 
State mandates, fees and policies drive about 25% of monthly energy bills. There are also usage costs, set by third-party suppliers with no room to renegotiate by state administrators nor the utility provider. A separate set of distribution charges is imposed by Rhode Island Energy to help pay for customer service, infrastructure and technology upgrades and emergency outage responses, among other investments. McKee’s appointed, three-member Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over the company’s distribution charges, but the governor himself does not.

Hence, why McKee’s energy affordability plan only touches on the portions of customers’ bills under his control. In addition to revising the renewable energy standard, McKee has proposed a suite of other changes. They include:

Limiting credits to customers who return renewable energy to the grid through direct or virtual projects (mostly solar) and adding a “grid access fee” for large-scale solar fields to cover the costs associated with development, connection and operations. This change would cut ratepayers’ costs by $35 million a year.
Capping utility spending (based on ratepayer charges) for energy efficiency rebates and incentives to home and business owners at $75 million a year. There is no cap currently. This would save an estimated $21 million for ratepayers each year.
Revitalizing a longstanding practice, ended by state utility regulators in 2024, that lets Rhode Island Energy spread out the cost for road repaving over a longer period rather than accounting for the expense in its annual operating budget. This would save $16 million in ratepayer charges each year initially, although it compounds repayment over a longer time period.
Axing a state performance incentive to Rhode Island Energy meant to encourage long-term renewable energy contracts, saving ratepayers $2.5 million a year. 

The collective changes, most of which would take effect in January 2027 if approved by the Rhode Island General Assembly, would save the average residential customer $180 a year, or $15 a month, over the next five years, according to the state budget office.

A short-term fix?
Short-term savings come with long-term consequences, including higher costs, Munter warned.
For example, rolling back the state Renewable Energy Standard will prolong the state’s reliance on a limited, unreliable and expensive natural gas supply. Dethroning Rhode Island as a state leader in climate incentives also means sacrificing its edge in the renewable electricity credit marketplace. Electricity suppliers can purchase credits from renewable energy projects anywhere, and Rhode Island’s ambitious incentives for clean energy production draw buyers from other states, fueling the state economy with money and jobs.
And then there are the unquantifiable health and safety benefits from a shift away from fossil fuels.
“The savings won’t show up on your utility bill, but Rhode Islanders will see environmental and health consequences in their life if, for example, air quality worsens,” Munter said.
Especially with less money available to make the switch to clean energy in their own homes and workplaces under McKee’s proposed cap on state energy efficiency funding. 
“It’s a serious concern of mine to cap energy efficiency, and to imply that cutting energy efficiency spending will benefit Rhode Islanders,” said Emily Koo, senior policy advocate and Rhode Island program director for the Acadia Center. 
Rhode Island Energy’s $95 million energy efficiency budget for 2026 is already 18% less than the $117 million budget for 2025, and nearly one-third below the annual amount that Rhode Island Energy pledged to spend in a three-year plan submitted in 2023.
Limiting state funding also fails to recognize the long-term savings for ratepayers who winterize windows and doors, upgrade furnaces and thermostats or even switch to high-efficiency electric heat pumps, Koo said. And in her view, the drought of federal funding for energy efficiency investments makes preserving, and boosting, Rhode Island’s rebate program even more important.
Koo also serves as a member of the advisory board to the Rhode Island Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council, a consortium of state agencies charged with developing a plan to meet Rhode Island’s decarbonization mandates under the Act on Climate law. The council’s first comprehensive review of state progress and future projections, unveiled in November, warned the 2050 net-zero emissions mandate is out of reach without “additional ambition” to incentivize a clean energy transition. Its analysis assumed the existing incentives and funding McKee now wants to roll back.
“From my point of view, it would appear that elements of the governor’s budget are inconsistent with the Act on Climate,” said Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat and chair of a legislative panel created in 2025 to monitor implementation of the Act on Climate law.

However, Zurier said he wanted to keep an open mind, awaiting more detail on McKee’s budget proposal when the five-member Senate panel meets on Wednesday, Jan. 28. Its agenda includes a presentation from Terry Gray, Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management director and head of the Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council.
Gray reiterated McKee’s rationale on the energy bill cuts.
“If customers aren’t comfortable with their electric bills, and they’re not comfortable with the stability in their electric bills, they’re not going to transition over to the appliances we need to meet our mandates,” Gray said in an interview directly after the Jan. 15 budget briefing with reporters.

Eye on 2050
Gray said the state’s 2050 decarbonization deadline was “still achievable,” while noting the need for more frequent tweaks to the state’s plan especially under Trump.
“There are so many things up in the air right now, it’s crazy,” Gray said. “In our climate planning over the next three years, we’re going to have to read and react.”
Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and co-chair of Climate Jobs Rhode Island, suggested it was premature to upend Rhode Island’s clean energy path.
“I think we should give ourselves one more year,” Crowley said. “Hopefully, things will change in Congress and we can get back on track. My concern is that we are going to drop our focus on what we need to do.”
Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, did not directly address these suggestions or critics when asked for comment.
“The Trump Administration has drastically changed the energy landscape, by taking steps to limit or eliminate available sources of clean energy—thereby driving up costs that are passed onto ratepayers and casting uncertainty on our ability to meet our aggressive climate goals,” DaRocha said in an emailed response Wednesday.  “Meanwhile, rising energy costs are driving family budgets to the breaking point; Rhode Islanders need relief now, not later. We remain committed to an affordable energy strategy that still provides a pathway to decarbonization and leverages lower cost, zero-emission resources.”

The blame game 
While McKee pointed the finger at Trump, local advocates and lawmakers focused their ire on Rhode Island Energy and its parent company, PPL Corp., contrasting the public company’s multimillion-dollar profits and C-suite executive salaries with ratepayers who struggle to keep the lights on. 
A bevy of bills floated in the 2025 legislative session sought customer affordability by capping company profit margins, or creating competition in the form of a state-owned public utility. The measures drew opposition from Rhode Island Energy, and failed to advance out of either chamber.
Sen. Alana DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat, thinks the policy might be worth a fresh look, especially as Rhode Island Energy seeks to raise service charges on gas and electric customers. The company’s application, submitted to state utility regulators a day before Thanksgiving, proposes a two-year set of bill hikes starting in September 2026, adding more than $9 per month to the average residential customer’s electricity bill and more than $440 to annual, average gas bills. 
In unveiling the proposed distribution rate hikes, Rhode Island Energy defended the need for $230 million operating revenue to cover inflationary costs and supply chain expenses. The company has been unable to seek a distribution rate increase to offset its service expenses since taking over the state’s gas and electric operations in 2022 as part of the sale agreement with state utility regulators. The moratorium ended in May 2025. 
Regulators also required the company to refund customers for deferred income tax hikes associated with the 2022 acquisition. Rhode Island Energy, working with McKee, initially pitched a $149 million, two-year discount plan to honor its 2022 refund commitment, but withdrew the proposal in the fall amid scrutiny over the calculations. The company said previously it plans to file an alternative payout plan this year, but has not submitted anything as of Wednesday.
Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, pledged to review McKee’s rate cut changes in full detail.
“We remain committed to providing safe, reliable, and affordable energy for our customers, and will be actively engaged in the upcoming discussions to help shape solutions that benefit Rhode Islanders,” Dalo said in an emailed response on Jan. 15. 
The Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission declined to comment on the governor’s energy relief package. 



Cleaner alternatives 
Energy advocates have their own suggestions for soothing the pain of rising energy bills without putting clean energy plans at risk. They include:

Discounting winter electric rates for ratepayers that switch to electric heat pumps, modeled after a program in Massachusetts that took effect this winter which is projected to generate a median savings of $687 for customers with heat pumps, and $361 in median savings for those without.
Eliminating the ratepayer-funded program offering free gas line extensions to homeowners who live within a limited distance of an existing line.
Requiring or incentivizing utility companies to employ new technology (hardware and software) that increase capacity and efficiency of the regional electric grid, cutting costs for utility companies and their ratepayers.

Voters were shown the shape of a few particularly contorted districts and were asked to describe what they saw.
“It kind of looks like the Loch Ness Monster,” a woman said.
“A snake that looks like it was run over by a car,” one man offered.
“Like a dragon on its back, floating in a pool or something,” another woman ventured.
Last week, Democrats – on party-line votes in both chambers of the General Assembly – paved the way for a statewide referendum in April in which voters will be asked whether or not Virginia should make a limited return to its gerrymandering past. 
If Democrats succeed in re-introducing partisan gerrymandering this year, Virginia voters may be even more flummoxed by an inkblot test of the state’s 11 congressional districts.
 Virginia’s redistricting amendment: What is it and what happens if voters pass it?

Democratic legislative leaders approved a proposed constitutional amendment that could  result in a gerrymander so extreme that a new congressional map would leave Virginia’s far southwestern tip as the only safe haven for Republican candidates. General Assembly Republicans railed against the plan, but were powerless to stop it. 
Democrats say their plan is a one-time and necessary response to President Donald Trump’s unprecedented mid-decade redistricting arms race. The Republican president has demanded that red states like Texas and Florida rejigger their congressional maps in order to flip a few more Democratic districts this November in midterm elections.
“When other states manipulate their maps to gain unfair advantage … they also harm Virginia’s ability to have its fair representation in Congress,” Democratic Majority Leader Scott Surovell said during Friday’s floor debate. “We’re simply seeking to level the playing field in Congress.”
The Democrats’ reason that a short-term return to gerrymandering in Virginia is better than to sit by and allow Trump to manipulate the midterms and escape any check on his seemingly boundless notion of presidential power.
By the end of this month, Democrats are expected to unveil a map of how far they would press their political advantage. The state’s current congressional district split of 6-D, 5-R roughly reflects the state’s two-party competition.
Democratic legislative leaders want to flip four of the five Republican seats, leaving conservative voters in Tidewater, Southside Virginia and the Shenandoah Valley with little expectation for the rest of this decade of being able to pick a congressional candidate of their choice.
Gov. Abigail Spanberger, a former three-term congresswoman who made a name for herself by winning in Republican-leaning districts, has said she believes Democrats can pick up two seats this November without touching the maps.
In a December interview with Politico, Spanberger noted that she had carried the 1st District and the 2nd Districts, which stretch from Henrico County to Virginia Beach.
“I want to flip seats in the House of Representatives, and I know that we can because we just — I just won those districts,” she said.
Legislative leaders say they also want to flip the 5th District,which extends from Charlottesville to the North Carolina line, and the 6th District, which runs the length of the Shenandoah Valley from Roanoke to Winchester.
In her first address to the General Assembly on Monday, Spanberger gave her strongest endorsement so far of the April ballot measure, calling it a justifiable response to actions by other states to undermine democratic norms.
“Make no mistake,” she said, her tone firmer, “Virginia will be responsive, targeted and only with the will of the people. And I trust the voters to get this one right.”
 What would Democrats’ 10-1 map look like?

The reaction of the voters could depend on how extreme of a gerrymander Democrats put forward later this month.
There is a debate among Democrats about how far to push their advantage. Democratic leaders including Virginia Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, have advocated for a 10-D,-1-R map.
Hobbyist mapmakers have posted various options for a 10-1 configuration, including one that shows deep-blue Fairfax County broken into five narrow channels of voters that fan out into the rest of the state. 
This unofficial rendering could be what Virginia Democrats’10-d, 1-R congressional district map will look like, according to hobbyists mapmakers. Democrats have said they will release their proposed map before it goes to the public for a vote in April. (Photo courtesy DavesRedistricting.org)
In this version, people as far as Rockingham County in the Shenandoah Valley, Powhatan in the western exurbs of Richmond and Mathews County on the lower Chesapeake Bay could find themselves represented by someone from Fairfax County.
It’s hard to know if people will be bothered by the disruption caused by so many voters being shifted to districts. Will voters care that a 10-1 map could result in nearly half of the state’s congressional residing in Fairfax County?
Spanberger has cautioned against a maximalist map, which could put at risk some of the six districts currently represented by Democrats.  
Lucas did not respond publicly to Spanberger, but on social media told the state’s Democratic congressmen to put on their big-boy pants. 
“Anyone in the congressional delegation who wants a seat needs to campaign for it and not expect a safe seat,” she said.
 Analysts split on whether Virginia’s mid-decade changes will make a difference 

Dave Daley, a national redistricting expert, said that Democrats in Virginia and elsewhere are placing too much emphasis on the short-term promise of gerrymandering. 
Daley said the only sure path forward for a Democratic majority in the U.S. House of Representatives is for the party to learn how to replicate Spanberger’s success in reaching voters in rural districts.
The long-term math simply won’t work for Democrats after congressional seats are reapportioned based on the next Census in 2030, Daley said.
California and northeast states stand to lose 12-14 seats to fast-growing red states like Texas, Arizona and Florida. And if the U.S. Supreme Court invalidates the last vestiges of the Voting Rights Act later this year, another 12-19 Democratic seats in the deep South would be at risk. 
“Democrats can’t gerrymander their way out of this,” he said, “They have to find a way to persuade voters that they are on their side. I’m not against fighting back against unfairness, I’m simply saying if you are going to charge up a hill, have a plan that works.”
Some analysts predict that Trump — with his foreign policy interference, ICE raids in Democratic cities and voters’ mounting worry about rising health insurance costs  — will lose so many House seats this November that one or two extra seats from Virginia would hardly be worth the effort. 
Veteran Democratic analyst James Carville recently forecast that Democrats will gain a minimum 25 seats, maybe as high as 45. 
“Frankly, it’s going to be a wipeout,” Carville said.
 What do Virginia’s 2020 redistricting reform advocates say now?

In November 2020, voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment to rein in politicians’ ability to draw district lines. The measure passed in every Virginia locality except Arlington County. 
OneVirginia 2021, the bipartisan group that was the moral voice behind the state’s 2020 redistricting effort, mobilized roughly 500 volunteers who used to show up at the polls statewide with signs reading “Fair elections start with fair districts” or “It’s not about right vs. left. It’s about right vs. wrong.”
While the success or failure of Virginia’s mid-decade redistricting effort has yet to be determined, one thing seems certain: OneVirginia 2021 — now rebranded as UpVote Virginia — will not be calling out oddly-shaped districts or questioning the whip-lash reversion to politicians picking their voters instead of voters picking the politicians.
UpVote Virginia has shifted its focus to improving the democratic process through ranked-choice voting. The group’s executive director Liz White said that UpVote will stick to its new mission and has no plans to get involved in this year’s redistricting fight.
“I feel like everyone is disappointed to be having this conversation again, and felt that Virginia will not be part of this ugly national fight,” White said. “It’s disheartening.”
Similarly, last fall in California,  when Democrats sought to counter a mid-decade redistricting in Texas, reform groups did not oppose a ballot initiative that bypassed the bipartisan California Citizens Redistricting Commission.
“People who previously had worked on redistricting reform were basically told to stay on the sidelines,” said Carah Ong Whaley, who, as the executive director of a California democracy reform group, was one of the few reform advocates who spoke out. “Many of the in-state groups were frustrated.”
Ong Whaley, who also is a program manager at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, took the position that “fighting fire with fire leads to a scorched earth democracy.” 
“I don’t see why we’d want to go back, when what is best for our country, period, is free and fair elections that are competitive,” she said.
When Trump launched the mid-decade redistricting battle, other reform advocates in Virginia thought the state would be immune because the process of amending the state constitution usually takes several years. 
“We were patting ourselves on the back and thinking, ‘Oh, this can’t happen in Virginia,’” said Kathy Utgoff, a retired economist who served as a commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics from 2002 to 2006. Utgoff also volunteered with OneVirginia 2021 in the Falls Church area and found meaning in grassroots work to bring fair elections to Virginia. She now chairs the UpVote Virginia board of directors.
When Democrats devised a way to speed up the process by putting the question to voters in a special statewide election in April, Utgoff was frustrated. 
“Ending (gerrymandering) took the better part of a decade. Now the plan is to undo the commission in the matter of months,” she said.
Still, other reform advocates support a limited, one-time carve out.
Bob Gibson, who served on the advisory board for OneVirginia 2021 and once led the bipartisan-nurturing Sorensen Institute, called the upcoming amendment a “necessary response if we are going to preserve democracy” in this country.
“I think this is an unfortunate thing that has to be done,” added Gibson, who lives in Charlottesville.
Democrats emphasize that their proposal is a temporary exception that would leave Virginia’s bipartisan Redistricting Commission in charge when lines are scheduled to be redrawn in 2031. 
They emphasize that voters will get a chance to see the proposed map and must give their permission to any changes in the state’s congressional maps.
“The main thing is it’ll go to a referendum,” Lucas said. “But I think (voters) are going to love the maps and they’re going to love the 10-1.”
 Pro-redistricting campaign takes shape

With reform advocates on the sidelines, a Democrat-funded organization called Virginians for Fair Elections has appropriated the reform group’s rhetoric and moral certainty.
“We can restore fairness with an amendment that gives Virginians the power to level the playing field,” says a video released by Virginians for Fair Elections. “And it’s temporary, reaffirming Virginia’s commitment to bipartisan redistricting.”
Virginians for Fair Elections had yet to  file paperwork with the state Department of Elections, but has already lined up social media influencers to talk up the April ballot measure, including TikTok star Suzanne Lambert, also known as the “Regina George liberal.”  
Lambert encouraged her Instagram audience to vote yes to Virginia’s redistricting amendment in April and reminded them that it would be a temporary measure.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)While the list of indigent defendants waiting for court-appointed counsel is continuing to shrink, Maine’s public defense system is quickly running out of money to pay its rostered attorneys. To tackle the $13 million shortfall, Sen. Anne Carney is asking her fellow lawmakers to come up with the needed funds — or risk undoing that progress.
At a hearing before the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Carney warned about the impact if the Maine Commission on Public Defense Services runs out of money.
“Failure to pass this funding bill will prevent PDS from paying bills to assign counsel in the fourth quarter, likely leading to a soaring number of unrepresented individuals,” Carney said. 
“These unstaffed cases create inefficiencies within the system that impair all sides from resolving cases, which is costly,” she added, “both in terms of monetary resources, but also in the burden placed on indigent clients and the human capital of overworked systems.”
Last year, a state court deemed Maine’s failure to provide representation to criminal defendants who could not afford their own attorneys a constitutional crisis in violation of the Sixth Amendment. At that time, there were about 1,000 people waiting for attorneys. Since legal action was taken against the state system almost four years ago, Maine has built a network of public defender offices while continuing to contract the bulk of its cases out to private defense attorneys. Those efforts have led to the unrepresented list dropping to just over 250 defendants in December 2025.
However, for the past two years, the rostered private lawyers, who work at a reduced rate, billed the commission about $48 million, exceeding the annual budget.
Budget shortfall, burnout strain attorneys in Maine’s indigent defense system

Despite this, the Maine Legislature underfunded the commission again last session. Former executive director Jim Billings told Maine Morning Star at the time that the commission was on track to run out of money to pay private attorneys by April. 
Gov. Janet Mills signed a law in 2023 that raised the compensation rate for private attorneys contracted by the commission from $80 to $150. Freyla Tarpinian, the new executive director of the commission, told the Judiciary Committee Tuesday that the agency’s budget did not see a corresponding increase, leading to the current predicament.
Unless the Legislature passes Carney’s emergency measure, those who handle most of the commission’s criminal cases could go unpaid — and some may stop taking cases.
The commission has already made changes in anticipation of the shortfall, such as putting geographic limitations on practice areas and relying on courts to pay for counsel in cases where the commission is not statutorily required, but had previously paid private attorneys, such as weapons restrictions orders or involuntary commitments, according to its latest annual report.
“My heart goes out to the solo practitioners and the attorneys that make up our workforce, the people who do the work of [the commission] every single day, who we rely on for the vast majority of cases,” Tarpinian said. “They take less money for these cases than they do for their private practice, and the expectation is they’ll have a little bit of security, that the payments will come in so they can sustain their practice.”
Several defense attorneys who work with the commission echoed Tarpinian’s support for Carney’s bill, LD 2059. Emily Elmore, who takes on criminal defense cases in Oxford and York counties, said without payment there will be an inevitable shift away from commission cases to private clients, and once that happens, attorneys may not return to indigent defense work.
“Assigned counsel carry the full financial burden of their practice and extended uncertainty in state funding is simply not sustainable,” she said.
Robert Ruffner, director of the Maine Indigent Defense Center, which has 23 employees predominantly focused on taking criminal defense cases in Cumberland and York counties, added, “if this shortfall isn’t addressed, I’m required to shutter my doors.” 
Peter Lehman, who works with the Maine Prisoner Advocacy Coalition, said the potential for more defendants to be placed on the waitlist would be devastating for people and families, with some even in jail waiting for representation. Lehman explained that when people wait weeks or months for an initial appearance, they could lose their jobs, homes and cars with some already incarcerated defendants waiving rights, signing confessions or pleading guilty just because of the lack of representation. 
“This is an emergency, and we want to come here and speak up, not for all the legal issues, but for the lives involved of the defendants and the victims with their lives placed on hold,” he said.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/transgender-hearing-19-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-22 05:36:30.916027

Adele McClure join parents and advocates for early childhood and access for a gathering in Richmond on Jan. 21, 2026. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Kaila Brewer, a Chesapeake mother and special education teacher, had to leave her job during the COVID-19 pandemic to care for her five-year-old son, who is autistic. Child care services were scarce at the time, and the few available could not accommodate her child’s special needs.
“It was extremely disheartening … I felt like my child was unwanted or pushed aside,” Brewer said. 
That experience spurred her to advocate alongside other parents and supporters at the state Capitol on Wednesday and urge lawmakers to expand early childhood care options.The group addressed the urgent demand for high-quality child care and pressed for the state to increase child care investments to benefit more families.
A recent survey found that 65% of Virginia employers said their workers struggle to find open child care slots and more than 85% cited cost as a major burden for their employees.
In statewide survey, employers say Virginia child care crisis negatively impacts businesses

During the pandemic, the federal government distributed relief funds to states, including Virginia, to stabilize child care providers, expand subsidy programs and increase access. 
But after the funds expired in 2023, a gap was left for the commonwealth to fill.
Lawmakers and then-Gov. Glenn Youngkin responded by investing nearly $1 billion in child care. 
House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said lawmakers invested around $900 million in child care over the past two budget cycles during a meeting with parents Wednesday morning. He also proposed successful legislation that made the commonwealth the first to create a child care reimbursement program for his colleagues in the House.
“I understand how important early child care is,” Scott said. “If I’m not known for anything else when I leave this job as speaker, it would be that we have done everything that we can to make child care more affordable and more accessible in the commonwealth.”
Still, advocates are asking lawmakers to go further to make child care more accessible. 
The Virginia Promise Partnership, a coalition of organizations advocating for fully funding high-quality child care, is requesting a state investment of $681 million in the 2027-2028 biennial budget. The partnership said this will help meet families’ needs, compensate educators, keep classrooms open and incentivize employers to support employees’ child care needs.
Tomashia Cornitcher, a parent and Family Connections for Kids First Years coordinator, said her family benefited from early childhood education. She’s now working with other parents to have the same opportunities.
“We are grateful for our representatives,” Cornitcher said. “However, we are still in dire need because that investment helped us prevent families from losing services, but did not extend access to more families who are on the wait list.” 
VPM News reported last October that nearly 14,000 children were on a wait list for the Child Care Subsidy Program alone.
Ryan O’Tooole, co-executive of Freedom Virginia, a coalition member, said another key priority is paying quality teachers fairly.
“If a child is in a child care program, those teachers are teaching,” O’Toole said. “It is not babysitting or caring until the parent comes home, but it’s early education that is crucial to a child’s development and having a successful system that can promote economic mobility, that can promote economic stability, that helps businesses keep their employees. All of that only works if we have those providers.”
In addition to the child care challenges low-income families face, Cornitcher also said middle-class families are feeling the financial pinch. She said in some cases, families earn too much to qualify for free or low-cost early childhood education, and too little to afford private options.
Advocates are backing legislative proposals aligned with Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s plan, which underscores expanding access and strengthening the early child care workforce as the pathway for a stronger, more inclusive system.
Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, and Del. Adele McClure, D-Arlington, are carrying a proposal to create the Employee Child Care Assistance Program, which would allow employers to receive state matching funds to help pay for an employee’s child care. 
Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, and Del. Briana Sewell, D-Prince William, filed bills to expand Virginia’s Child Care Subsidy Program so more families qualify based on income. 
The proposal directs the Virginia Department of Education to create a phased reduction for the Child Care Subsidy Program, so aid decreases gradually as families earn more. 
Del. Jackie Glass, D-Norfolk, along with Locke, is also carrying legislation that would make child care subsidies decline more gradually as families earn more, rather than drop off abruptly. 
Del. Mike Cherry, R-Colonial Heights, told the Mercury he supports Glass’ legislation and wants to build on the commonwealth’s progress.
“We are ahead, and we will stay ahead,” Cherry said. “We want to continue to innovate … and continue looking at what we’re doing — how do we encourage people to upskill, how do we encourage people to make more money, to be more self-sufficient, to not need the subsidies? … It’s by providing them that safety net as they climb that corporate ladder, to be the resources for them, to encourage them to be better and to do more.”

Abigail Spanberger gives her first address to the joint General Assembly. (Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)In her first address to the joint General Assembly, Gov. Abigail Spanberger stated that Virginia will rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI.
RGGI is a regional initiative by 10 states to cap carbon emissions by limiting how much pollution energy production facilities can emit – and they have to purchase permits for each ton of carbon they emit. 
Permit sales are held quarterly. The money earned by each state’s sale is then reinvested back into the state for flooding resilience projects, weatherization and energy efficiency programs for low-income households.
Virginia received over $800 million over the three years the state was in the program before the removal. The law directs 50% of the funds to low-income efficiency programs, 45% to the Community Flood Preparedness Fund, and the remainder to administrative costs.
“RGGI generated hundreds of millions of dollars for Virginia — dollars that went directly to flood mitigation, energy efficiency programs, and lowering bills for families who need help most,” Spanberger said in her speech.
The estimated cost of the utilities’ permits that is passed down to ratepayers averages about $2 a month for most residential customers. 
When in office, Gov. Glenn Youngkin removed the state from the agreement, calling it an unnecessary tax. The move was then appealed in court and a federal judge deemed the governor’s removal of the state unlawful because the General Assembly hadn’t authorized it. 
However, the process to rejoin is not as easy as just saying the state wants in. 
House Bill 397, sponsored by Del. Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, is working through the General Assembly that will solidify the ability of the body to put the state into RGGI and set up the market cap trade process. 
Herring said there are efforts to add an amendment to the budget bill that would speed up the process and potentially get the state back into RGGI this spring. Some advocates are hoping the state can partake in the sale slated for early summer if the amendment is approved.
Those opposed to the state rejoining the agreement point towards the cost to consumers – which some believe goes against the affordability messaging that Democrats campaigned on, since it would tack on an additional charge on utility bills. 
A representative for the Virginia Manufacturers Association, Brett Vassey, spoke against the bill in a subcommittee with concerns over the cost and urged the lawmakers to consider changing where the funds are funneled. 
“We need more (energy) capacity in the market,” Vassey said. “There probably is an opportunity to look at that allocation and see if there’s a way to generate more electricity, even green electricity, and help local governments to be part of that as well.”
Some lawmakers are not on board with the effort to return the state to RGGI. Del. Joseph McNamara, R-Roanoke County, said Virginia is purchasing power to meet demand from states that are not part of the agreement. 
“When I talk about us going out of state from a power procurement perspective, it’s impacting our transmission costs,” McNamara said.
Proponents for the bill said the cost is worth it for flood resilience and the aid to low-income families that will see their bills go down after benefitting from the efficiency programs.
“What they ignore is the long-term benefits, and how it’s actually going to decrease costs for energy in the long term for low income consumers,” Herring said.
The proposed budget amendment language is anticipated to be released later this week. There has been no word yet on if or when Attorney General Jay Jones will withdraw the state from the appeal to the previous judge’s order against the removal from RGGI.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Days after Gov. Abigail Spanberger renewed her push to tackle housing affordability in her State of the Commonwealth address, Virginia lawmakers say they are newly optimistic about advancing a slate of bills aimed at easing the state’s housing crunch.
Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, referred to the proposals as “one of the key things that won us a historic majority in the House of Delegates.”
Like Spanberger, Democratic lawmakers ran last year on promises to address housing challenges — from the rising cost of rent to barriers to home ownership and a lack of supply. 
Several of the proposals had previously cleared the legislature before being vetoed by former Gov. Glenn Youngkin. At a news conference Wednesday, both new and returning lawmakers expressed renewed confidence that those ideas could finally become law. 
Among the measures highlighted was House Bill 816, carried by Helmer, which would allow by-right zoning for apartment buildings or townhomes in certain commercial corridors. 
More simply put, “that bill streamlines the conversion of old strip malls and office parks into new homes,” Helmer said. 
Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, emphasized that the bill could help keep people closer to where they work — particularly public servants such as teachers, firefighters, law enforcement officers and service industry workers. 
As the patron of the Senate version, VanValkenburg shared his own experience as a public school teacher, noting that if he were just starting out today, he would struggle to afford housing in the region. 
“I’m a teacher who can afford a house in my locality because I bought a house 20 years ago and have that capital,” he said. “Teachers that are starting in the profession now cannot afford to buy a house in Western Henrico anymore.”
Helmer and VanValkenburg have also carried a more contentious proposal highlighting longstanding tensions between state and local governments. The bill would require localities to take steps to boost housing affordability or risk state intervention overriding certain local decisions. Under the measure, local governments must “demonstrate a good faith effort” to meet housing growth targets outlined in the legislation. 
The bill did not reach Youngkin’s desk, though it did pass the House of Delegates. 
“There is give and take in the bill,” VanValkenburg said last year while defending it. “I would argue that this is more than a local problem, this is a state problem.” 
That sentiment was echoed repeatedly during Wednesday’s news as lawmakers discussed additional proposals returning this session. Several pointed to a survey conducted last year that identified housing affordability as a top concern for Virginians. 
Del. Joshua Cole, D-Fredericksburg — who is also a pastor — is carrying legislation that would allow faith-based institutions or nonprofit organizations to build housing on land they already own. A version of the bill was introduced last year, and U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., has also introduced similar legislation in Congress. 
House Bill 262, sponsored by Del. Shelly Simmonds, D-Newport News, would prohibit localities from requiring minimum parking mandates for new developments. 
Simmonds said the bill “gives flexibility to builders to provide the right amount of parking.” She emphasized that it does not eliminate parking altogether, but removes locally mandated minimums that may not make sense for certain projects. 
Sen. Saddam Salim, D-Fairfax, who is carrying the Senate version, said parking mandates can result in wasted space that could otherwise be used for housing or drive up rent prices. He noted that depending on a development’s location and residents, not everyone can afford a car or may choose to rely on public transit instead. 
Overall, Helmer said he is “encouraged” by the new governor and the a renewed momentum around housing policy. While tensions can arise between state and local governments, he noted how some legislators bring first-hand experience from local office. 
That includes Del. Margaret Franklin, D-Prince William, who previously served her county’s board of supervisors. Newly-elected to the House, Franklin has been appointed to the Housing, Cities and Towns Committee, where she can draw on that experience as lawmakers debate housing legislation.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Jacksonville state Rep. Angie Nixon announced Thursday that she is running for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate this year.
The seat is now held by Republican Ashley Moody, appointed a year ago by Gov. Ron DeSantis. A Florida Democrat hasn’t served in the U.S. Senate since Bill Nelson lost his bid for a fourth term narrowly in 2018.
Nixon’s decision is not exactly a surprise. She announced last fall that this would be her last term in the Florida House and has been making visits around the state for months as part of her “Awake the State” tour.
Initially elected in 2020, Nixon is considered one of the most progressive members of the Democratic House caucus, and has proudly proclaimed herself “the biggest pain in Ron DeSantis’ ass.”
She earned the enmity of Republicans over the years, such as when she led a protest on the House floor in 2022 to protest a congressional map drawn up by DeSantis that eliminated two districts where Black residents constituted a plurality. She also sparked controversy in November 2023, when she called for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, a little over a month after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas.
Republican Party of Florida Chair Evan Power mocked Nixon after she wrote on social media in September that she was considering a bid for Senate. “I needed a good laugh today, looks like @AngieNixon wants to lose a U.S. Senate race. I think it’s a great idea,” Power wrote on X.
The best known Democrat to have entered the race to date is Jennifer Jenkins, a former school board member from Brevard County. A public opinion poll conducted by the University of North Florida’s Public Opinion Research Lab in October showed Moody with an 11-point lead over Jenkins, 49%-38%.
The Cook Political Report lists the race as a “solid R” seat.

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)A proposal intended to expedite land use and development permitting would restrict the types of evidence state agencies could use to justify protection of threatened and endangered species.
Rep. Sayra DeVito, prime sponsor of House Bill 1603, said the measure would protect landowner rights, streamline the permitting process, and promote housing availability. But state officials said the bill as proposed could jeopardize the continued existence of animal species already on the brink in New Hampshire, while placing a burden on the state agencies tasked with protecting them.
State agencies regularly use a database containing records of threatened and endangered species to inform decisions about land use, such as whether to grant a permit for development at a site that may contain protected animals and their habitat. As proposed, DeVito’s bill would specifically require time- and location-stamped photographs of those species for such considerations, and would require that a landowner give written permission for the data to be collected — or, if they decline, that the agency seeking the data procures a warrant.
“Before land is restricted, there should be clear, lawful, and location-specific evidence that a species is actually present,” said DeVito, a Danville Republican, at a meeting of the House Resources, Recreation, and Development Committee Wednesday, Jan. 21.
HB 1603 takes the form of an amendment to the New Hampshire Endangered Species Conservation Act, which lays out protections for endangered and threatened wildlife species in the state in line with the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973. 
The New Hampshire act tasks the state Fish and Game Department and Department of Environmental Services with protecting species deemed threatened or endangered, including by identifying and documenting such species and taking action to conserve them from threats like habitat destruction and illegal hunting. 
Rep. Mary Murphy, a Republican from Francestown, said she favored the bill after experiencing permit delays at her 100-plus acre riverfront property due to a previous sighting of a threatened turtle species. The delays added $20,000 to the cost of the project, she said. 
Meanwhile, Jason Stock, executive director of the New Hampshire Timberland Owners Association, spoke in favor of the bill, saying landowners often preferred to manage threatened species themselves and did not want to share data about their presence on private property.
However, Rep. Will Darby, a Democrat from Nashua, said he was concerned about the requirement for landowner permission or a warrant before land could be assessed for the presence or absence of endangered species.
“If the endangered species only live on private property, this might not allow them to be protected,” he said.
DeVito said she shared the goal of protecting endangered species, but was concerned that data collection on private property violated landowners’ rights.
The requirement for documented landowner permission could nullify existing records that the state relies on to make conservation decisions, said Michael Marchand, supervisor of the department’s nongame endangered wildlife program, at the hearing. As proposed, the requirement would also apply to data gathered before the bill’s adoption.
The database contains a range of data, including surveys from state biologists, consultant reports, and documented, department-vetted sightings by constituents, Marchand said. While he said it was the department’s “practice” to get landowner permission, often verbally, before surveying a property, no records were maintained of such interactions and permissions; for this reason, he believed the bill would render their existing database unusable.
“We feel the criteria introduced by this bill would nearly eliminate all the records used in that database for searches, and … would require complete review, and probably require starting over on that database,” he said.
Removing the database would slow down the permitting process, while requiring the department to seek information about species presence through other means to fulfill their obligations under the Endangered Species Conservation Act, Marchand said. 
In written testimony submitted to the committee, New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services Commissioner Robert Scott also said the proposal would increase costs by requiring additional work to confirm the presence of threatened species.
Nisa Marks, a former United States Fish and Wildlife Service biologist from Henniker, said the bill would endanger New Hampshire’s protected species. 
“In practice, it is unimplementable and would functionally end protections for most endangered species in New Hampshire,” she said. 
Photographic evidence of endangered species is difficult to find without significant effort, as such animals are often very rare and may be more or less active and visible at different times of year, she said.
“Absence of a photo does not mean absence of a species,” she said.
The additional work required in absence of database searches was one reason the bill could carry significant cost for implementation, said Marchand and New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services Assistant Commissioner Adam Crepeau at the hearing. As proposed, the bill was assigned a fiscal note showing costs upward of $1 million.
DeVito proposed an amendment to the bill to narrow its language, saying she did not envision that the additional work required would cost as much as the initial fiscal note had indicated.
“This bill was always about how information is used when it results in land use restrictions, not about rebuilding existing systems,” she said.
The committee did not take action on HB 1603 on Wednesday, but will likely take it up again at their next meeting, said Rep. Robert Harb, the committee chairman.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7820-1024x685.jpeg,,,2026-01-22 05:36:30.916027

Rhode Island celebrated the 60th anniversary of its Medicaid program in 2025. This may sound like just another policy milestone, but the data tells a different story: Medicaid expansion has profoundly impacted lives across the state.  
Rhode Island expanded Medicaid under the provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA), which allowed states to expand Medicaid coverage to adults with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level (now about $21,597 annually for an individual or $36,777 for a family of three). As a result, the state achieved a record-low uninsured rate of 2.2% in 2024 — far below the 17.4% average in states that opted not to expand. The state now outperforms the national average on key health metrics, including adult smoking rates, vaccination coverage, and infant mortality rates. The overall health of Rhode Island’s children has also improved, contributing to higher school attendance and lower dropout rates. 
In other words, Rhode Island demonstrates that Medicaid expansion works. Now imagine the opposite. In the 10 states refusing to expand Medicaid, approximately 1.4 million adults remain uninsured. Many fall into a “coverage gap,” earning too much to qualify for Medicaid, but too little to receive subsidies for ACA Marketplace plans. These Americans are simply left out of receiving insurance. 
Note: *State has a trigger law that would end expansion coverage or require states to take steps to mitigate increases in state costs if federal funding for the expansion is reduced.Source: KFF tracking and analysis of state actions related to adoption of the ACA Medicaid expansion and Searing, Adam. “Federal Funding Cuts to Medicaid May Trigger Automatic Loss of Health Coverage for Millions of Residents of Certain States.” Say Ahhh!

A comparison between Rhode Island and Texas highlights the stark disparities between an expansion state and a non-expansion state. Rhode Island ranks among the top five states in overall health system performance, while Texas ranks among the bottom five. The consequences are clear. In Texas, 13.7% of children are uninsured, compared with just 3.8% in Rhode Island. Cost remains a significant barrier to care, with 17.6% of Texans forgoing needed care due to expense, nearly double the rate in Rhode Island (10%). Primary care access follows the same pattern: 75.9% of Texans report having a primary care provider, compared with 87.5% of Rhode Islanders. For Rhode Island readers, this may feel distant as we’ve already closed that gap here. But travel a bit south, and the border between Kentucky and Tennessee becomes more than a line on a map. There, a treatable diagnosis could become not just a health crisis, but also a financial one. 
In Tennessee, a non-expansion state, residents often delay care because of cost, leading to medical bills they cannot afford. Nearly 59% of Tennesseans report receiving an unexpected medical bill. Just across the border, Kentucky’s Medicaid expansion has made health care more affordable and accessible, allowing residents to receive treatment earlier rather than facing preventable crises.
Rhode Island’s success should serve as a model for others. Peer-reviewed research has linked Medicaid expansion to decreases in mortality in cancer patients, significant reductions in all-cause mortality, and fewer rural hospital closures. 










Rhode Island’s success should serve as a model for others.


Expanding Medicaid was a long-term investment in Rhode Island’s economy, not just another item in the budget. When Rhode Islanders are healthier, they are more productive in the workforce; families are more financially secure; the economy grows as people stay in the labor force; and hospitals aren’t overwhelmed by uncompensated care. Other states have recognized this. North Carolina expanded Medicaid in 2023, extending coverage to over 600,000 adults to support rural hospitals and reduce medical debt. In Oklahoma and South Dakota, voters took matters into their own hands and passed expansion directly at the ballot box. 
Public support is not a barrier. Polling shows that about two-thirds of residents in non-expansion states support expanding Medicaid. Yet policymakers ignore them and make unsupported claims that expansion would reduce labor force participation. Research actually shows no drop in employment and, in some cases, small gains. One scholarly review calls the refusal to expand Medicaid “the most potent symbol of political resistance to government’s role in health policy.” It’s in a state’s own interest to expand Medicaid. The 90% federal match would send billions of dollars to their hospitals and communities, rather than sending that money to expansion states.
Rhode Island’s experience demonstrates that political choices matter and can yield tangible results. Its fourth-place ranking in overall health systems nationwide is not an abstract achievement; it is the direct outcome of Medicaid expansion. This success gives the state a strong voice in the national Medicaid debate. Policymakers, health leaders, and advocates can point to this evidence to counter misinformation and support expansion efforts in the 10 remaining states. 
We’ve already proven that expansion saves lives. Now remaining states should follow our lead.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/34897-22_0-1024x670.jpg,,,2026-01-22 05:36:30.916027

Danny Carroll spoke out against allowing teenagers to conceal carry in the last legislative session. (Screen grab)On Jan. 21, as President Trump was giving his speech in Davos — confusing Iceland with Greenland during his absurd pitch as to why the U.S. suddenly needs to annex (a verb) Greenland as a matter of national defense — Kentucky lawmakers were in Frankfort annex (a noun) room 149 hearing about why 18 to 20 year-olds need to be granted legal authority to conceal-carry firearms.
House Bill 312 reads, in part, that it will “authorize the Department of Kentucky State Police (KSP) to issue provisional licenses to carry concealed firearms and other deadly weapons to persons who are 18 to 20 years of age.”
Fast tracking bills continues
I subscribe to Bill Watch on the legislature’s website, so when a bill I’m tracking has a change in status, I am notified. The email notification advising me that HB 312 had been assigned to the House Judiciary Committee arrived at 8 p.m. on Jan. 20, and lo and behold it was already on the committee’s agenda for the next morning at 10 a.m.
The League of Women Voters wrote just a few weeks ago, on Nov. 13, about the Kentucky legislature’s penchant for fast-tracking legislation, stating they support “informed and active citizen participation in government. We remind our elected officials that they work for the people, were elected to represent the people, and must give the people opportunities to understand and give input on legislation that affects us.”
It was 14 hours between the time the public was notified that HB 312 had been assigned to a committee and the bill being heard.
In the committee meeting, it took 10 minutes for the HB 312 to be presented, discussed, voted on and passed.
No citizen spoke against HB 312. How could they? Even those of us who know enough to get alerts from the legislature’s Bill Watch system do not have enough time to read a bill, prepare a statement, get off work and drive to Frankfort before it is too late.
This is the very definition of fast-tracking.
And it is undemocratic.
The danger of concealed-carry for 18-20 year olds
Imagine a bunch of teenagers conceal-carrying loaded guns to a party, getting into a drunken fight, and pulling out their guns.
Imagine a teenage girl in her college dorm room with a boy, and him pulling out a gun when she refuses to have sex. Or imagine that same girl in her dorm room, pulling out a gun to defend herself against a more powerful boy and the two of them fighting over the gun.
Imagine loaded handguns concealed in thousands of backpacks on college campuses all over Kentucky: guns in your kids’ college classrooms, guns at frat parties and house parties, guns left in drawers and desks and under beds in dorm rooms.
Similar legislation was presented last March in the form of Senate Bill 75, sponsored by state senator Aaron Reed.
After Reed’s presentation during the Senate Judiciary Committee, state Sen. Danny Carroll — who spent two decades as a police officer — voted no in committee, saying, “I personally do not see anything to gain by passing this bill, and that’s from 24 years [as a] law enforcement officer. You know, you’re always taught to assume that everyone is carrying a concealed weapon, mainly with the segment of society that law enforcement often deals with, and I think this is just going to kick that up to another level and they are going to be carrying concealed.”

Carroll continued, “The idea of people carrying a concealed weapon, who may not even know how to shoot that weapon, is terrifying.”
And yet even after their fellow GOP colleague — with a career in law enforcement — made such a stark and alarming argument, SB 75 passed easily out of committee.
Thankfully, it never made it to the House.
Until now.
One of the arguments for this year’s HB 312 — I recall the same argument being made last year — is that 18-year-olds can join the military and carry firearms. What they do not mention, of course, is the extensive training and constant practice required in the military, and that soldiers are not allowed to just carry their guns around willy-nilly because they feel like it.
The military has rules. Strict rules. The general public does not.
House Bill 312 is a dangerous bill, whether it requires training or not. House Bill 312 will encourage kids to conceal-carry firearms because they think it’s cool.
A Kentucky teenager doesn’t need a concealed firearm any more than the United States needs Greenland.
As Sen. Carroll said about the similar bill filed last year, HB 312 is terrifying.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/unnamed-1024x501.jpg,,,2026-01-22 05:36:30.916027

Violence on behalf of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown is on the rise. (Screenshot from video by Monica Bicking via Minnesota Reformer)State leaders who want to curb the increasingly violent arrest tactics of immigration enforcement agents in Minneapolis and elsewhere are struggling to push back.
They’ve promised civil rights legislation that could offer alleged victims another route to courts, ordered up official tribunals to gather video and other records, or asked cities to refuse requests to cooperate with raids. But for the most part, states looking for concrete ways to push back find themselves largely hamstrung.
Violence in immigration enforcement is on the rise. A federal immigration agent’s killing of Renee Good in Minnesota on Jan. 7 was one of half a dozen shootings since December. An immigrant’s death in a Texas detention facility this month was ruled a homicide. And detention deaths last year totaled at least 31, a two-decade peak and more than the previous four years combined.
There also have been dozens of cases in the past year of agents using dangerous and federally banned arrest maneuvers, such as chokeholds, that can stop breathing.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in masks and tactical vests have been recorded firing pepper spray into the faces of protesters, shattering car windows with little warning, punching and kneeing people pinned face down on the ground, using battering rams on front doors, and questioning people of color about their identities.
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has defended many recorded incidents as legitimate uses of force against dangerous people. And some Republican state lawmakers have said they’ll work to bolster ICE’s work within their borders.
Some lawmakers, legal experts and immigrant advocates worry about whether a lack of oversight from the federal government and the weak positions of state governments could give rise to even more violence as President Donald Trump continues his push to arrest immigrants who are living illegally in the United States.










You can’t go after a murderer and a garden-variety immigration violator like a poor nanny or a poor landscaper with equal emphasis.


– Muzaffar Chishti, Migration Policy Institute


Previous administrations have prioritized arresting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who also have criminal records, but that isn’t the case in Trump’s second term.
“You can’t go after a murderer and a garden-variety immigration violator like a poor nanny or a poor landscaper with equal emphasis. This administration has abandoned all discretion and all priorities, and you create this narrative that you’re doing this patriotic, godly thing,” said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank.
Chishti said there has been a surge in abusive tactics that comes from a series of federal policies. He cited the massive infusion of inexperienced officers under heavy pressure to make arrests, the military-style tactics meant to create spectacle and fear, and the harsh rhetoric aimed, he said, at instilling warlike hostility toward immigrants and protesters.
More agents, more incidents
The number of ICE law enforcement agents doubled in less than a year, with Homeland Security announcing this month it has hired 12,000 new agents out of some 220,000 applicants. More agents have surged into cities such as Chicago and Minneapolis, their semiautomatic weapons, bulky vests and balaclavas often contrasting with local police officers wearing name badges and carrying sidearms.
Noem has insisted that ICE and other officers are the real victims of increased violence, citing instances like one on Jan. 14, when a man was shot in the leg by an ICE agent. She said in a news release that bystanders struck an officer with a snow shovel and broom handle in Minneapolis as the officer tried to catch a fleeing suspect. Noem called it “an attempted murder of federal law enforcement” in which, “ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired a defensive shot to defend his life.”
ICE is using Medicaid data to find out where immigrants live

Court papers released Jan. 20 included an officer’s account of only two assailants, the suspect and a friend who owned the car he had been driving, and said the injured suspect was trying to escape into the apartment building and that tear gas had been used to force the men to surrender.
Noem, who claimed Monday that more than 10,000 immigrants have been arrested in Minnesota, has described some people living in the U.S. illegally as “foreign invaders.” She characterized Good’s shooting as self-defense against “an act of domestic terrorism.”
And in a press briefing Tuesday, Trump told reporters that the people being deported “make our criminals look like babies. They make our Hells Angels look like the sweetest people on Earth.”
Such descriptions have become a tool that incites violence, Chishti said.
“When they say that they were doing God’s work with Renee Good, that she was a domestic terrorist, when you frame it that way from the highest leadership of the agency, you’re basically sending a signal that there’s no accountability,” he said.
Democrats push back
State leaders who say they’re worried about violence are trying different approaches, though they can’t completely curb federal policies.
New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said state resources would not be used to assist in immigration raids, citing the shooting of Good. But local agencies in New York could still use other funds to help with raids.
New Mexico Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham called for curbs on immigrant detention in the state, though two of three existing detention centers there could still continue to operate.
Colorado has launched a new system for claims of misconduct by federal agents, including ICE agents.
Democrats shrug as Trump threatens ‘sanctuary’ cities again with February funding cutoff

Some Republican-led states are taking the opposite tack, with Tennessee proposing legislation that would go beyond cooperation with federal immigration by setting up its own state immigration laws. If enacted, it would test the limits of a 2012 Supreme Court decision that struck down state-based immigration enforcement based on a similar Arizona law.
Tennessee is using White House guidance to draft the legislation, and other states are likely to follow. That would create new civil rights concerns if states pick up some of the same tactics as the federal government.
“That’s another way of unleashing the states, not only to work with the federal government, but also to acquiesce in the states’ enactment of their own immigration enforcement, detention, and removal regimes,” said Lucas Guttentag, a Stanford Law School professor who runs a project tracking federal immigration policy, speaking in a May interview published by Berkeley Journal of Criminal Law.
Combating the federal moves is already fraught, said Guttentag, who has served in immigration policy positions in the Obama and Biden administrations.
“No single political strategy can change it,” Guttentag told Stateline this week. “But litigation has proven both critical and effective in limiting some of the most egregious violations. The violence is a clear violation.”
It’s hard to police an administration that constantly pushes legal boundaries, Guttentag added.
“It’s like a ‘catch me if you can’ administration. They adopt tactics and basically challenge anyone to try to stop them.”
Two former federal prosecutors, Kristy Parker and Samantha Trepel, argued for state civil rights legislation and investigation in a Jan.14 op-ed published in The Guardian with the headline “Cities and states must hold ICE accountable for violence. The feds won’t.”
Accountability commissions — like one created by Illinois in October after ICE operations there — can help, they wrote, preserving evidence and gathering testimony in the face of federal obstruction, like the blocking of a state investigation into Good’s death in Minnesota.
Potential civil rights legislation
Another method mentioned by the former prosecutors: State civil rights legislation could theoretically give people harmed by federal agents a hearing in state court under a legal concept called “converse-1983.”
GOP redistricting could backfire as urban, immigrant areas turn back to Democrats

New York’s Gov. Hochul has proposed such legislation. A similar Wisconsin measure died in July when the Republican majority on the Assembly judiciary committee would not give it a hearing, said Democratic Rep. Andrew Hysell, the bill’s sponsor.
“It’s a positive approach to preserving our rights here in Wisconsin, our constitutional rights, because you can no longer count on the federal government to do that,” Hysell said. “In the situations we’ve seen in Minnesota, the federal government is crossing the line into what appears to be violations of constitutional rights.”
However, the idea of “converse-1983” has yet to be used successfully to sue a federal agent, and might never succeed, said John Preis, a law professor at the University of Richmond.
“I would be shocked if converse-1983 [lawsuits] went anywhere,” Preis said. “States may not enact laws that impede federal officers who were doing their jobs. A converse-1983 action would seem to do this.”
However, in some cases, such as the shooting death of Renee Good, victims may be able to successfully sue the federal government without such a state law, Preis said. The process is difficult but the lawsuit could succeed if a constitutional civil rights violation can be proven, he said. Attorneys for Good’s family announced Jan. 14 that they were considering a lawsuit.

Jon Husted (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images.)During a recent U.S. Senate committee hearing, Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted spoke against the abortion pill, a target of the Trump administration as well as legislation at the Ohio Statehouse.
The U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee held a hearing on “protecting women against dangerous abortion drugs,” in which the attorney general for Louisiana and other speakers spoke in favor of further regulations and FDA scrutiny for the abortion pill mifepristone.
It comes amid a re-review of the drug requested by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., back in September 2025.
The chair of the committee, Louisiana Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, specifically said the hearing was convened to hear testimony on “dangerous chemicals abortion drugs,” despite the fact that decades of research and some testimony at the same hearing have shown mifepristone to be medically safe and severe complications to be rare.
“Scientifically and morally, there is no difference in the value of a child, whether she is in her mother’s arms or she is in her mother’s womb,” Cassidy said during the hearing.
Husted sits on the committee and participated in the hearing on mifepristone.
He gave two examples in which men are accused of forcing women to take medication abortion without their knowledge or against their will as argument against the drug. He said requiring an in-person visit before dispensing the drug “would stop this.”
Husted also pointed to his own adoption story, in which he said his mother could have chosen abortion.
“Thankfully for me, she didn’t,” Husted said.
An OB/GYN and fellow for Physicians for Reproductive Health, Dr. Nisha Verma, pointed to more than 100 “high quality, peer-reviewed studies” that prove mifepristone’s safety and effectiveness, surpassing the fewer than 10 studies suggesting that the drug is not safe.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
One study that is often cited by anti-abortion Republicans was a “policy paper that was self-published,” Verma told the committee, and included “routine care” as serious adverse events.
She said the science “is more than settled” on the safety of the abortion method, “which really does beg the question of what are we doing here today.”
“And it may be that we are here today because people in this room feel uncomfortable with abortion, and that’s okay, and we can talk about that,” Verma said. “But we should not pretend that this is an issue of the science.”
The American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists has said the complication or death risk from an abortion procedure “is less than the same risk from common procedures like wisdom tooth removal, cancer-screening colonoscopy, and plastic surgery.”
Advocates in Ohio further insisted on the safety of the treatment, and said in-person requirements would create an accessibility problem for health care.
“Telehealth and mail-delivery options for medication abortion are particularly crucial for patients living in rural areas, patients with child care or other caretaking responsibilities, or patients with transportation challenges,” said Erica Wilson-Domer, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio.
On Husted’s examples of men forcing mifepristone on unknowing or unwilling women, Wilson-Domer said those “are criminal acts, not a result of the drug’s accessibility.”
“The isolated anecdotes that Sen. Husted bases his argument on should not be used to justify restricting this extremely safe and effective medication,” Wilson-Domer said in a statement.
The FDA first approved mifepristone in 2000, and has since updated its regulation of the drug to allow telemedicine methods.
What remains in place for the drug is a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, an FDA drug safety program used for several medications to verify distributors of the drug are properly authorized to do so and “ensure the benefits of the medication outweigh its risks,” according to the FDA’s website on the programs.
Ohio’s General Assembly is considering its own moves connected to medication abortion, with Republican-led legislation active in committees.
This includes bills such as Ohio House Bill 324, a general drug regulation bill that would require in-person prescription and ban telehealth options for drugs with severe adverse effects occurring in more than 5% of patients.
Mifepristone came up during hearings for the bill, because abortion advocates argued non-peer-reviewed studies like the one mentioned in the U.S. Senate hearing could be reported to the Ohio Department of Health as reasoning to categorize the medication abortion drug as one in need of in-person requirements.
Anti-abortion groups claimed the bill would provide “necessary safeguards” for mifepristone.
Other bills still up for consideration include Ohio House Bill 370, which would bring back the concept of “fetal personhood” to effectively ban abortion at conception; and Ohio House Bill 347, which would force patients to wait 24 hours before having an abortion, potentially returning to law a requirement paused by an Ohio court.
Ohio Senate Bill 309 would require prescribers of mifepristone to inform patients that they can sue the physician, the health care facilities, and others should complications arise from the drugs.
Physicians and abortion rights advocates have said not only does the law duplicate informed consent requirements already included in their medical training, but it could bring about mistrust between doctors and patients.

Mayors in Danbury, New Haven and Hartford said they’re holding discussions with their police chiefs and thinking through how best to manage confrontations between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and local residents. That includes working with community groups to ensure residents understand their rights, investigating incidents where those rights may have been violated and generally working to keep everyone safe — in their neighborhoods and at protest events. 
ICE more than doubled its arrests in Connecticut in the first six months of 2025 compared with the same time period in 2024, according to agency data. And last August, federal agents arrested 65 people in a four-day operation they termed “Operation Broken Trust.” According to ICE, 29 of the 65 people arrested during the operation had been either charged with or convicted of “serious crimes.”
Local law enforcement is often unaware of ICE operations until they happen. Under a Connecticut state law known as the Trust Act, local law enforcement cannot cooperate with ICE detainers unless the person being detained has been convicted of a serious crime, is on a terrorist watch list or if there is a judicial warrant for their arrest. In November, the state legislature passed additional restrictions on ICE, including codifying a policy that prohibits agents from arresting people inside courthouses and forbidding state agencies from widely sharing residents’ personal information. 
Danbury Mayor Roberto Alves said he frequently speaks with the city’s chief of police about what’s happening around the country.
“We’re not made aware when [ICE agents] come — small, medium, large deployments or not,” Alves said. “But we will handle our business accordingly … we’ll be ready to keep our people safe within the confines of the law.”
In the case of a protest, Alves said, local police officers try to strike a balance between being present for safety reasons — like the possibility of a protest and counter-protest meeting head to head — but also ensuring that people can exercise their right to protest freely. Alves said any incident between ICE and community members would have to be addressed on a case-by-case basis. 
Alves said he wanted to be careful not to take any action that could draw attention and bring more ICE agents into the city unnecessarily. “My goal, my moral compass, has always been: How do I protect our folks, our hardworking folks who are here just to better their lives and make sure that we’re not exposing them to more ICE agents?” Alves said.
In Danbury, the city has worked to help connect community groups to each other and to residents to offer support. “ The best thing any community can do right now is work with groups to expand and fortify the ‘Know Your Rights’ campaign so people know what their rights are, what they can do and what they shouldn’t do,” Alves said. 
Carolina Bortolleto, an organizer with the group Danbury Unites for Immigrants, said school districts should establish protocols for how to respond if ICE agents are in the area or a child’s parents are detained during the school day. She said local organizations like hers offer family preparedness classes, providing instruction in appointing temporary guardians and gathering documents they’ll need to have on hand. 
Bortolleto said it felt important, to her, that local officials speak out more clearly against ICE deployments and state clearly that the agents’ presence isn’t making the community safer. 
“ I think that kind of posture is needed from local elected officials, because it sets the tone for what we as a state will not tolerate,” said Bortolleto.
New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker hasn’t shied away from doing that. 
A large ICE presence “is very much a potential reality,” Elicker said, “and we’ve been working hard to prepare for significantly increased ICE rates — which would make our community less safe and are not welcome in our city.”
After signing an executive order in 2020 that prevents city employees from inquiring about a person’s information status or sharing that information with federal agencies, Elicker said the city has been enforcing that order and training employees. New Haven is a party to several lawsuits against the Trump administration, including one contesting the administration’s order to hold back funding from cities that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. 
Elicker pointed to press conferences the city has held with advocates to voice support for people detained by ICE, like 18-year-old Esdras R., who was arrested by ICE in July while working at a car wash. Esdras was released from custody in September. 
“Working to publicly shine a light on the individuals that were arrested helps [us], in some cases, be successful at garnering their release,” Elicker said, adding that he attended the immigration court hearing at which the judge agreed to release Esdras. New Haven has also worked with advocacy groups to help provide pro bono legal representation for immigrants. 
Still, the city is limited in what actions it can take against ICE agents, Elicker said. If an ICE agent were to assault someone in New Haven, Elicker said, the federal government would likely lead any review of the use of force; local police wouldn’t be able to arrest the agent, he said. 
In Hartford, Mayor Arunan Arulampalam has been working through the aftermath of an incident earlier this month in which a federal vehicle knocked down a protester during a vigil for Renee Good, who was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis on Jan. 7. The Hartford Police Department has opened an investigation into the incident. 
Arulampalam told the Connecticut Mirror that he’d spoken to the Department of Homeland Security, which is conducting an internal investigation. He said he was told the agency wouldn’t respond to any requests for information Hartford police sent as part of their investigation.
But Arulampalam said if Hartford’s investigation finds that federal agents committed a crime, the city would “seek to prosecute that criminal wrongdoing.” He said he believes Hartford police should treat federal agents the same way they would respond to any other person they witness engaging in violence.
For now, the mayor said, city officials will do everything possible to ensure that people gathering legally for a protest can do so safely. But he urged protestors not to engage in violence or lawlessness. 
Last Tuesday, roughly 100 protesters gathered on the front lawn of the state Capitol to protest ICE. 
Mary-Ann Langton and Patty Ellis, the organizers of the protest, said they believed there are actions cities in Connecticut can take to better prepare for ICE deployments. Langton emphasized more training for people, and Ellis said she’d like to see formal protocols established for how to interact with ICE agents.
Ellis also said she believes local law enforcement officials in Connecticut shouldn’t hesitate to arrest ICE officers, if the situation requires it. 
“We’re not seeing much of or any of that yet,” she said. 
Mindy Shilansky from West Hartford said she hopes Gov. Ned Lamont and leaders of Connecticut’s large cities would be “equally unwelcoming” to federal immigration agents as leaders of other communities around the country have been.
Carol Coley of Columbia said a local response team in her community sends out messages whenever ICE agents are seen in nearby Willimantic. People who get those messages then converge on the area, and their presence alone has been enough to spur the agents to leave, she said. 
“The goal is just take pictures, don’t get in their way … just take pictures and witness it,” Coley said.
Some protesters expressed anxiety about the possibility of a large ICE deployment in Connecticut. 
“I’m just scared. I don’t want that to happen here,” said Ashley Valerioti of Hamden. But she said it might ease her concerns if she knew “that our politicians have our back and that they will fight for us — both locally and nationally.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IndivisibleProtest011326-SR-4-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-22 05:36:30.916027

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security oversees both Customs and Border Patrol as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but they are different agencies. 
Customs and Border Patrol focuses on immigration at the border while ICE, which was not present at the career fair, enforces immigration law throughout the country. 
A protester holding a “DHS off campus” sign was arrested inside the career fair in front of the Customs and Border Patrol booth and two people gathered outside the ballroom were arrested. 
Two of the people arrested were Ohio State students and the other person was an Ohio State intermittent staff member, Ohio State University Spokesperson Dan Hedman said. Ohio State has not released the names of those arrested.

“Three individuals were arrested for criminal trespass, following multiple warnings, after disrupting a career fair event inside the Ohio Union and violating university space standards,” Hedman said in an email. 
After interacting with the protesters, the Customs and Border Patrol recruiters left the career fair about 30 minutes after it started. The career fair, which had more than 150 public and private sector employers, lasted four hours Tuesday afternoon. 
Dozens of protesters remained congregated for about thirty minutes outside the ballroom after the Customs and Border Patrol recruiters left and Ohio State senior Jineen Musa encouraged protesters to leave. 
“We achieved what we came out here to do,” said Musa, who is also an organizer with Students for Justice in Palestine. 
“Our purpose in being out here today was to have (CBP) removed from the career fair,” she told the Capital Journal. “That’s to say they left in cowardice. If folks autonomously didn’t stage this protest, they would not have left.” 
Lillian Chesak, a junior at Ohio State, said she protested because she has family that are immigrants.

“Everybody’s scared,” she said. “It’s not great.”
Customs and Border Patrol has attended the Ohio State career fair for several years, said Ohio State Spokesman Ben Johnson. 
This protest comes a month after more than 280 people in central Ohio were detained by ICE in one week during Operation Buckeye, which ICE launched from Dec. 16-21.
Ohio Immigrant Alliance reported last month that at least 214 people detained were in detention as of Dec. 24. Ninety-three percent were men and 80% appear to be Latino, according to a report from the Ohio Immigrant Alliance. 
An ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis earlier this month. Good was a U.S. citizen who, according to reports, was operating as a “legal observer.”

The state’s voter turnout varies per election, ranging from 70% for the 2024 presidential election to 10% in 2025. “Democracy works better when we all participate,” said Catherine Turcer, a voting rights advocate at Common Cause Ohio. When it comes to elections, […]","Graphic by WEWS.Ohio Democratic lawmakers have proposed legislation to make Election Day a state holiday.
The state’s voter turnout varies per election, ranging from 70% for the 2024 presidential election to 10% in 2025.
“Democracy works better when we all participate,” said Catherine Turcer, a voting rights advocate at Common Cause Ohio.
When it comes to elections, every vote counts — especially in local races, she said.
The Cuyahoga County Board of Elections data shows 10 races were within about 20 votes, with six being within 10, and there were even several ties.
In Cincinnati, the Hamilton County BOE results show that at least 12 races were within 20 votes, with eight being within 10.
“We can’t all participate if we don’t have good access,” Turcer added.
Research from Tufts University found that of people who didn’t vote in the 2024 presidential election, about 25% said they had conflicting work or school schedules.
State Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, proposed a solution.
“If elected officials in Ohio really respect voters, we should respect them enough to allow them to get to the ballot on election day,” Smith said in an interview.
He introduced, alongside several Democratic colleagues, Ohio Senate Bill 335, which would make a general election a public holiday. The first Tuesday after the first Monday in November would be “Democracy Day.”
“Holidays are considered special days, and that’s one of the things that I think we need to always be doing — trying to educate the young people in Ohio about the importance of voting,” the lawmaker said.
At least 14 states have Election Day as a holiday, according to the Movement Advancement Project, with five of them also requiring employers to give voters paid time off.
Seventeen other states, ones that don’t consider it a holiday, mandate paid time off.
Ohio is one of the remaining states that doesn’t require either. However, Ohio does allow for voters to get a “reasonable amount of time” off during the day to do their civic duty.
Turcer isn’t convinced this will actually fix low voter turnout, as many industries still work holidays. Also, child care could be an issue if people aren’t able to bring their kids to the polls.
She said a better option would be to mandate paid time off.
“It could also leave a lot of lower-income and essential workers behind,” Turcer said.
Sec. of State Frank LaRose’s team doesn’t think a holiday is necessary.
“Ohio has one of the most accessible election schedules in the nation, with nearly a month of early voting, including evening and weekend hours. Every day’s a holiday when you can return your ballot from the comfort of your own home. We also have a very generous 13-hour voting window on Election Day itself, and we encourage all employers to give their employees time off, if needed, to engage in their civic duty,” LaRose’s spokesperson Ben Kindel said.
But just months ago, Ohio changed its election laws.
Ohio Senate Bill 293, now signed into law, could make it harder to have your vote counted.
The new law, which goes into effect in mid-March, requires nearly every ballot to be counted on election night.
Previously, the state had a four-day grace period for ballots to be received and counted by Ohio’s 88 boards of elections if they were postmarked before Election Day.
The new law axing that grace period came as Republicans had made so-called “election integrity” a priority over the past few years, as President Donald Trump baselessly claimed that there was massive fraud in the 2020 election.
Turcer fears that politicians could try to reduce other voting options, like early and mail-in, if Election Day is a holiday.
“We should be thinking about ensuring that we have better access to a diversity of ways to vote,” Turcer said.
The bill will be heard in the coming months, and Smith is confident that, despite the legislature having a GOP supermajority, his idea is bipartisan and can succeed.
Future Sec. of State
We reached out to the declared Republican and Democratic candidates for secretary of state for their takes on the legislation.
Democratic candidate and former House Minority Leader Allison Russo said she fully supports making Election Day a holiday.
“Voting should be an engaging, rewarding experience, celebrating our democracy and citizenship. Why does it just have to be send in a ballot or stand in a line? It should be a day to celebrate our democracy and our right to participate in deciding who governs and how we move forward as a society,” she said. “So it’s more than just convenience. It’s about making a statement. There may be ideas and actions as important, but there is nothing more important than voting.”
Democratic candidate Dr. Bryan Hambley also agreed that it was a good bill.
“He has spoken previously with Leader [Nickie] Antonio about this idea, and is very supportive. As Secretary of State, he would champion making it easier and more fair for Ohio citizens to vote, and this would be a positive step in that direction,” Hambley’s spokesperson Alissa Riessinger said.
Republican candidate and current state Treasurer Robert Sprague is in favor.
“In-person voting on Election Day, where IDs are checked and eligibility is easily verified, is the most secure form of voting, and it should be both a federal and state holiday. At the same time, we should look closely at no-fault absentee voting, as voting by mail is significantly more vulnerable to fraud, chain of custody lapses, and postal errors,” Sprague’s spokesperson Dalton Throckmorton said.
We asked further about whether this meant that Sprague would consider taking away the ability for the majority of citizens to vote by mail if elected, and also requested evidence for the claims that mail-in voting is “significantly” more vulnerable to fraud.
Sec. LaRose has continued to assure skeptics that Ohio is the “gold standard” and elections are wholly safe.
Sprague’s team didn’t comment on the additional questions.
Republican candidate Marcell Strbich also provided a comment on the proposal.
“On this bill, I can see its utility if Ohio law changed to same-day in-person voting, but with 28 days, there’s no point. It’s an optics bill to score political points now that S.B. 293 passed, eliminating the 4-day post election grace period,” Strbich said.

,Pennsylvania Capital Star,2026-01-22 09:46:26+00:00,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,Beyond NIMBY vs. progress: How Pennsylvania can secure a “durable yes” for data centers,Desmond Daley,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/commentary/beyond-nimby-vs-progress-how-pennsylvania-can-secure-a-durable-yes-for-data-centers/,The real conflict is fragile yeses versus durable yeses.,"A data center is proposed for this site in Upper Burrell Township, Westmoreland County. (Photo by John Beale for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star)The room smells like burnt coffee and legal fees. In a Pennsylvania township hall, a resident clutches a petition while a developer’s lawyer extols “jobs.” A council member looks down at the word on everyone’s mind: lawsuit. Both sides feel trapped. 
This scene is playing out across the commonwealth.
Pennsylvania’s data center debates are often narrated like a culture war: “jobs” versus “NIMBYs,” growth versus preservation. 
That framing keeps us stuck. 
The real conflict is fragile yeses versus durable yeses. A fragile yes is an approval forced through opacity or legal pressure, technically a yes that collapses under the first stress test. A durable yes means the project moves forward with enforceable rules that give residents safety and developers certainty.
Both sides have real reasons to be angry. 
Residents fear a bait-and-switch: promises of jobs and tax revenue followed by fine print revealing massive water withdrawals, around-the-clock noise, and a deal signed before anyone understood the terms.

In Springdale in Allegheny County, plans for an AI data center include upward of 100 diesel backup generators and a 180 MW power draw. Developers, meanwhile, fear endless delays. Borough council approved the project by a 5-2 vote, not because members believed in it, but because they felt threatened with lawsuits if they said no.
In Plymouth Township in Montgomery County, a two-million-square-foot proposal was abruptly withdrawn after legal snags and community pushback. 
In Blakely in Lackawanna County, developers walked away amid chaotic zoning battles. Both fears (betrayal on one side and paralysis on the other) can be seen as rational responses to weak governance.
 In Chester County, more than 12,000 people signed petitions against a data center near Pennhurst. In Hampden Township in Cumberland County, officials scrapped a zoning change after outcry over water usage and opted for a moratorium. 
Across the map, communities are asking a single question: Who holds leverage when the promises meet the paperwork?
We have a blueprint for something better.

In Lancaster, officials negotiated a Community Benefits Agreement that capped water use at 20,000 gallons per day, set noise limits to ambient levels, and mandated 100% renewable energy (or equivalent payments into a sustainability fund), all tracked on a public dashboard. 
Lancaster proves that governance can create a yes that stays yes under pressure.
For skeptical residents, stronger governance is how you secure real limits. A reflexive “no” often backfires. It can trigger state overrides or push the project next door with zero local leverage. Approvals with enforceable caps beat rejection theater.
For developers, governance is often times not a brake, but an accelerant. 
Plymouth’s project did not die because rules were too strict; it failed because the process was murky and trust evaporated. Enforcement is infrastructure hygiene, not punishment. Boring, measurable agreements keep projects out of court and on schedule.
What would a Durable Yes look like? It starts with a few upstream choices:

Grid impacts: PJM’s latest capacity auction cleared at $329 per megawatt-day, nearly 10× higher than two years ago, driven in part by data center demand. Developers can disclose projected load, fund grid upgrades, and commit to demand response. No silent subsidies should be considered.
Water and air: Withdrawals can be capped, non-potable sources can be required, and promises can be locked into permits. In Blakely, a new ordinance mandates continuous noise monitoring with public alerts. If a small town can do it, any community can.
Incentive accountability: Pennsylvania’s Act 25 of 2021 offers sales-tax exemptions for data centers that create as few as 25 jobs, yet it requires no public disclosure of the benefits claimed. If the public takes the risk, the public gets receipts. That potentially means clawbacks, sunset clauses, and performance benchmarks.
Workforce: Data centers employ more than 1,000 tradespeople during construction, then fewer than 50 once running. That could require funded training pipelines and local hiring targets, with annual reporting on outcomes.
Transparency: After Coleman v. Parkland School District in November 2025, boards can legally add agenda items during meetings by majority vote. Communities could mandate early disclosure of impact studies and draft agreements before positions harden.

This is development. 
We learned from the steel industry collapse what happens when the upside is privatized and the downside is socialized. 
Local skepticism is memory, and memory is risk management, not NIMBYism.
Pennsylvania can lead in AI infrastructure, but only if we find ways to stop treating governance as a roadblock. Governance should to be more about traction than friction. Communities want safety, and developers want a green light that stays green. 
Durable yeses are sturdy, and sturdy is how you build what lasts.

(Photo by Doug Mills - Pool/Getty Images)America’s xenophobia and racism are again manifesting. On Dec. 2, the current president of the United States engaged in a racist tirade during a cabinet meeting, denigrating Somali immigrants as “garbage,” asserting that the nation of Somalia “stinks,” and declaring that America was “going the wrong way if we continue to accept immigrants who are not worthy of our country.”
Although Trump’s rhetoric is directed at the Somali population in Minnesota, it is crucial to acknowledge that Kansas also has a significant Somali community that will face threats and scrutiny. Furthermore, Kansas serves as an example of how hateful, xenophobic language can incite extremists to transition from rhetoric to violent action.
In 2019, three men from southwest Kansas were sentenced to substantial prison time for conspiring to detonate a bomb at an apartment complex in Garden City, where a number of Somali refugees lived. The three men used familiar xenophobic talking points about the refugee population, including dehumanizing language — calling them “cockroaches.”
Garden City and other regions of Kansas have experienced a substantial increase in Somali residents since the beginning of the 21st century. They migrated to the state, finding employment opportunities in the cattle and meatpacking industry.
These immigrants from Somalia, and those from other parts of the world, contribute to Kansas’ economy, pay taxes and help drive an agriculture-based industry that feeds the nation.
Trump’s rhetoric is not novel in America. In 1905, there was a debate regarding increased immigration, particularly immigrants from Southern Italy, Russia, Austria and Hungary. Nations that the popular Baptist minister Madison C. Peters claimed were not the most favorable “recruiting grounds under the sun for American citizens.”
Using familiar rhetoric, Peters and others, with no evidence, insinuated that the European nations were acting in self-interest by “allowing criminals their freedom on the condition of their emigration to the United States.” This furthers a common refrain of the current president that there was “no difficulty in accounting for the large increase in crime in America and its corresponding decrease” in the nations that are opening their prisons and asylums.
As a testament to the importance of understanding history, one nation legally opened its prisons to send criminals to North America.
In 1717, the British Parliament passed the Transportation Act, which authorized the release of convicted criminals and their subsequent transportation to the colonies for labor purposes. Consequently, between 1718 and 1775, more than 50,000 individuals were released from British, Irish and Scottish prisons, provided they departed for the British North American colonies.
This history was succinctly articulated by James Marmaduke Boddy, an African American minister and essayist, in a letter to the editor of the New York Tribune in response to Peters. In the piece, he concluded by reminding readers that America was largely founded by the “so-called ‘scum of Europe.’”
Today, we again watch the Trump administration employing unsubstantiated claims of nations emptying their prisons and asylums to inundate the country with criminal elements. Simultaneously, the White Hosue consistently relies on xenophobic and racist rhetoric to disseminate falsehoods and incite fear among immigrants and populations of color throughout the nation.
We observed this phenomenon during the 2024 presidential campaign, when then-candidate Trump asserted that Haitian immigrants were “eating the dogs. They’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live” in Springfield, Ohio.
A few years earlier, Trump referred to Haiti and several African nations as “s***hole countries” and pondered reasons behind the influx of immigrants and refugees from these nations rather than locations more suitable for the United States, such as Norway. Peters did the same more than century earlier.
Recently, Trump has again resorted to xenophobia and racism. In an unsubstantiated attack on an entire immigrant community, he disseminates misinformation and disinformation, ultimately intimidating and terrorizing specific groups of people.
We need to embrace the diversity that immigration provides to our nation, states and communities. We should address the dysfunctions and corruptions within our systems, not scapegoat the supposed outsider.
We need to say no to hate and division.
In 1876, Benjamin “Pap” Singleton wrote to Kansas Gov. Thomas Osborn, announcing that he and other Black Tennesseans would move to Kansas in search of a “better place.” This event marked the beginning of the Exoduster Movement, which brought thousands of Black migrants to Kansas in live and prosper.
Kansas has, from its inception, advocated for inclusion rather than exclusion.
Many residents of the Kansas territory opposed the expansion of slavery within our borders. Nearly a century later, young Black activists in Wichita demonstrated to the nation how to fight for desegregation by leading the nation’s first modern lunch counter sit-in at the influential Rexall-controlled Dockum Drug Store. Activists in Topeka championed desegregated education and became plaintiffs in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision. Finally, more that two decades before Brown, Mexican immigrants led protests against segregated schools in Wyandotte County.
These incidents collectively illustrate Kansas’ efforts to establish a multiracial democracy. While not always effortless or flawless and often achieved through the activism of Black and immigrant communities, change has come. Kansas has evolved into a more inclusive and prosperous society by embracing diversity and the contributions of residents.
I would prefer to reside in a nation and state that fights for the existence of a multiracial democracy. A country that recognizes the significant power and strength that America has gained through a more welcoming immigration policy.
The point of shared by Rev. James Boddy, President Barack Obama and President John F. Kennedy: “We are and will always be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once too.”
Such a belief will always be a more inspiring and welcoming sentiment than “they contribute nothing. I do not want them in our country.”

The small town of Springfield in Clark County is awaiting an invasion of unaccountable thugs who conceal their faces and identities, drive in unmarked vehicles with blackened windows, stomp on the Bill of Rights, and viciously brutalize human beings based on race and accent. 
The clock is ticking for 20 to 25% of the city’s population from Haiti. In two weeks, barring last-minute legal or congressional intervention, immigrants from the violently imploding Caribbean country will lose their legal protection from rampaging ICE warriors eager to fill deportation quotas.
After Haitians endured campaign lies, an Ohio town prepares for ICE

The militarized sweep of terror unleashed by unrestrained federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents that has traumatized Minneapolis and the nation writ large could be coming to Springfield soon. 
An estimated 12,000 to 15,000 Haitian residents in the metro area — many of whom have been living, working, and raising families in the area for close to a decade under a legal immigration lifeline — will be stripped of their Temporary Protected Status (TPS) on Feb. 3.
That means on Feb. 4, a paramilitary ICE force of masked tough guys can grab and deport as many Creole-speaking Black people in Springfield as possible. 
Those who protest the savagery deployed against their neighbors could face the same harassment and dispersement tactics demonstrators in the Twin Cities did with flash grenades, tear gas, rubber bullets or, like Renee Good, worse.
The Ohio city is bracing for barbaric. 
Haitian residents cut off from their legally protected status could meet the same fate as other immigrants besieged by cosplaying federal Rambos with weapons and short fuses. 
The Haitians who flocked to Springfield to escape a violent homeland trusted Ohio to have their backs. They worked their tails off and endured much to revive a dying Rust Belt region. But the lives they painstakingly built in Ohio as co-workers, business owners, community activists and church-going family people are nearing an expiration date. 
The huddled masses who yearned to be free in Springfield are terrified of being returned to Haiti which is even more turbulent and deadly than when they left. 
It is considered too dangerous by the U.S. for its own citizens. 
The State Department gave Haiti its highest Level Four: Do Not Travel advisory due to extreme risks of being caught in gunfire or ongoing gang violence, kidnappings, armed robbery, sexual assault, and severe shortages of basic necessities including fuel, water, and food.

Yet while acknowledging (in a gross understatement) that “certain conditions in Haiti remain concerning,” the Trump regime insists the bloody hellscape is safe enough to ship 350,000 Haitian immigrants legally employed in the U.S, including Springfield, back home. 
The Department of Homeland Security even dangled a $1,000 incentive to Haitians who self-deport. 
One Springfield immigrant who is haunted by the bodies he saw regularly on the streets of Haiti, gunned down by roving gangs, flinched at an exit bonus to armed conflict. 
“You could be self-deporting to your death,” he said.  
The Haitians who turned to Ohio for security, employment, and hope rescued Springfield said local pastor Carl Ruby. 
The town had been in decline for 70 years before the 2017 arrival of Haitians, he explained. 
“We had shrunk all the way back to the population we had in 1910,” and the influx of immigrants, granted temporary refuge in Springfield, was “one of the best things that has happened in terms of economic growth and tax revenues” despite initial growing pains. 
“There were legitimate issues when such a large group arrived all at once, but we’ve made a lot of progress in dealing with those issues and it’s going to be both an economic and humanitarian disaster if TPS ends.”

At the Haitian Support Center in Springfield, executive director Viles Dorsainvil said many of his compatriots who survived political upheaval, insecurity and abductions in Haiti believed they had come to Ohio to work hard, raise their families, go to school and contribute to their community. 
Now they shudder with fear and uncertainty as their final hours of safety and stability ebb away. 
“But we keep going because we are a resilient people,” sighed Dorsainvil. 
Yet if the Trump regime revokes the Haitians’ temporary protected status a couple of weeks from now ICE agents could quickly invade Springfield, like other targeted cities, and drag documented immigrants from their children their homes, their dreams. 
Anxious town leaders are appealing for calm. 
Meanwhile, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine warned of a looming economic crisis in Springfield if area factories and business cannot find replacements for the thousands of terminated Haitian employees slated for indefensible deportation to what DeWine called “one of the most dangerous places in the world.” 
These immigrants were a godsend to American employers who struggled with hard-to-fill jobs. 
In a sane world, Republican leadership in Ohio would be fighting tooth and nail to protect the TPS holders from Haiti building a robust economic comeback in Clark County because it is clearly in the best interest of the state to do so. 
Ohio’s U.S. senators would be racing to obtain a TPS extension or redesignation for Haiti to give Springfield’s immigrant community work permit protections against removal to an extraordinarily unsafe country. 
But they acquiesce without a fight while the madness of a militarized sweep of terror comes to southwest Ohio.
And it will. Any day now.

El gobernador Gavin Newsom destaca mejoras en seguridad mientras la administración Trump acusa a los estados demócratas de tolerar el fraude en la asistencia social.,"This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Dos años después de una ola de robos de beneficios públicos que dejó a muchos californianos de bajos ingresos luchando por pagar el alquiler y comprar comida cada mes, el gobernador Gavin Newsom ha anunciado una importante disminución en la cantidad reportada como robada.
Los robos ascendían a más de $4 millones al mes el otoño pasado, tanto en los programas de asistencia alimentaria CalFresh como en los de beneficios sociales en efectivo de CalWorks, según un comunicado de prensa de la oficina de Newsom. Esta cifra es menor a la de hace dos años , cuando los beneficiarios de prestaciones públicas reportaban $20 millones al mes robados de sus cuentas. El estado utiliza el dinero de los contribuyentes para reembolsar a las víctimas cuando denuncian el robo.
 Newsom atribuyó la reducción a la implementación por parte del estado de tecnología antifraude, como tarjetas de beneficios electrónicos (EBT) más seguras con chips electrónicos.
“En California, estamos liderando el camino al convertir la innovación en acción, deteniendo el robo y garantizando que los beneficios lleguen a quienes realmente los necesitan”, dijo el gobernador en un comunicado de prensa.
 La oficina de Newsom anunció la mejora en las cifras de robos la semana pasada después de que la administración Trump intensificara las amenazas a California por acusaciones de fraude en prestaciones sociales. El presidente ha utilizado una oleada de procesos judiciales por fraude a los servicios sociales en Minnesota, algunos de ellos presuntamente cometidos por inmigrantes, como pretexto para enviar agentes de inmigración a realizar redadas agresivas en Minneapolis.
 A principios de este mes, la administración Trump congeló parte de la financiación federal a los servicios sociales en cinco estados gobernados por los demócratas, incluyendo California. Un juez suspendió por ahora la congelación , que incluía fondos para el programa de ayuda económica CalWorks.
El tipo de crimen en el que Newsom pregonaba reducciones no es el tradicional “fraude a la asistencia social” perpetrado por beneficiarios de prestaciones públicas, sino más bien un robo por parte de un tercero. Los funcionarios locales de servicios sociales han afirmado que el fraude por parte de beneficiarios es relativamente poco común.
 Los ladrones se han aprovechado de los beneficiarios de las prestaciones sociales de California mediante dispositivos ocultos de “skimming” para robar los números de tarjetas EBT cargadas con la asistencia alimentaria de CalFresh y las prestaciones sociales en efectivo de CalWorks. Luego, duplican las tarjetas y les quitan el efectivo o realizan compras grandes con CalFresh, antes de que los beneficiarios tengan la oportunidad de gastar sus propias prestaciones.
California era particularmente vulnerable debido al tamaño de su red de seguridad social, con aproximadamente 300,000 familias recibiendo ayuda en efectivo y 3 millones de personas recibiendo asistencia alimentaria. CalMatters informó en 2023 que el estado, previamente centrado en detectar el fraude cometido por los beneficiarios de las prestaciones, también había ignorado las advertencias y retrasado una propuesta para introducir tarjetas EBT con chip.
Cuando la pandemia trajo consigo nuevos beneficios de los gobiernos federal y estatal, como el aumento de las prestaciones por desempleo y los cheques de estímulo, ladrones con escáneres de tarjetas hicieron su agosto. Las tarjetas EBT, que en aquel entonces solo tenían una banda magnética, se encontraban entre las más vulnerables al robo. Casi 200 personas han sido acusadas en California de estafas EBT, según informó la oficina de Newsom.
Desde 2023, el estado ha respondido a la crisis de clonación de datos emitiendo tarjetas EBT con chip e implementando una aplicación que permite a los beneficiarios congelar sus cuentas EBT para evitar retiros. El año pasado, según Newsom, el estado comenzó a utilizar un modelo informático para detectar retiros fraudulentos y el restablecimiento forzado de los PIN o código de acceso de las tarjetas EBT de algunos beneficiarios de CalWorks.
 Pero los investigadores locales de fraude a la asistencia social dijeron que las cifras de Newsom pintan un panorama demasiado optimista del robo.
 Gregory Mahony, presidente de la Asociación de Investigadores de Fraude al Bienestar Social de California, dijo que cree que los robos denunciados en el estado están subestimados.
 Las cifras se basan en el monto que el estado reembolsa mensualmente a los departamentos de asistencia social de los condados para devolver las prestaciones a las víctimas. Sin embargo, algunos beneficiarios no se molestan en denunciar, o denuncian meses de robos, pero solo reciben una parte del reembolso, explicó Mahony.
 También criticó al Departamento de Servicios Sociales de California por eliminar en 2023 el requisito de que las víctimas presenten denuncias policiales cada vez que les roben sus prestaciones para obtener un reembolso. Esto ha perjudicado el seguimiento estatal del robo y el fraude, afirmó Mahony.
 “Esta no es una victoria sistémica”, declaró. “Es una mitigación tardía y parcial de una crisis que durante mucho tiempo se ha dejado crecer sin control”.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/012026-EBT-SCG-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-22 04:37:18.885640

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)As the Nebraska Legislature convenes for the 2026 session, our state stands at a pivotal moment. Decisions made in the coming months will determine whether Nebraska regains its competitive edge or continues to fall behind faster-moving states.
Throughout 2025, the Greater Omaha Chamber and our partners took a clear-eyed, data-driven look at where our metro region and Nebraska stands in today’s highly competitive economy. What we found was unmistakable: The gap between key metrics of Greater Omaha’s competitiveness and our peer metros is real, and it is growing.
Not long ago, the State of Nebraska was a national leader in economic development. From 2017 to 2019, we captured Site Selection Magazine’s Governor’s Cup three years in a row. Those results were not accidental. They came from modern tools, clear rules and a shared commitment to growth.
Since then, other states have accelerated while we have slowed. The data is clear: We now trail regional peers in job creation, population growth and major project wins.
The good news is that we are not starting from scratch. We have led before and with the right focus and resolve, we can lead again. But we must act quickly.
With this sense of urgency, we brought regional economic development and tax experts together to ask tough questions and focus on practical, proven solutions. The result was Omaha COMPETES — a practitioner-driven agenda grounded in real-world experience and designed to help Greater Omaha and Nebraska compete and win again.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
One encouraging signal that we are ready to take up this challenge came recently when Gov. Jim Pillen announced a major funding boost for the Business Innovation Act (BIA). This was a significant win for economic growth. The BIA has one of the strongest returns on investment of any economic development program in our state, supporting entrepreneurs, fueling innovation and helping homegrown companies scale. Reinvesting in this proven tool sends an important message: Nebraska values innovation, bold moves and the next generation of employers.
This win marks the beginning of a broader competitiveness strategy. Omaha COMPETES outlines what it will take to reverse that trend. First, we must modernize Nebraska’s core economic development incentives, so they are usable, competitive and timely.
Incentives are no longer differentiators. They are usually the first thing relocating companies look for in a potential state. If our programs are slower, more restrictive or less valuable than those offered by neighboring states, projects will go elsewhere.
Second, we must invest in truly shovel-ready sites. Speed matters. Employers today expect land with infrastructure in place, utilities ready and timelines measured in months, not years. Without those fundamentals, Nebraska will continue to fall out of contention before final decisions are made.
Third, competitiveness depends on talent. Nebraska’s long-term growth hinges on our ability to attract, retain and develop workers — especially young professionals. Programs that support internships, relocation and workforce training are now economic necessities with measurable returns.
The rollout of Legislative Bill 1165, the Grow the Good Life Act, reflects months of thoughtful collaboration between Pillen, his team, the Greater Omaha Chamber, our board and Public Policy Council, private-sector employers and other key partners to address one of our state’s most pressing challenges: retaining and expanding primary jobs and talent.
This proposal builds directly on the work of Omaha COMPETES and is designed to help existing Nebraska employers grow by strategically relocating operations and people to our state.
This is about aligning our state economic development tools with the realities of today’s economy and competing with the same urgency and confidence as our peers.
As the 2026 legislative session begins, our state has a choice. We can debate whether growth is worth pursuing, or we can act decisively to secure it. Now is the moment to show the nation that both our region and state are ready to compete, win and grow for the next generation.

(Photo via Ralph Arwood of Calusa Waterkeeper)Have you heard of Dry January? It’s a pledge not to drink alcohol for at least a month, a sign of your resolve to change your ways. But what if we made it about water — and changed it into Dry 2026?
I ask this because of several relentlessly upbeat stories I’ve seen lately about all the new developments planned for this year.
The Fort Myers News Press, for instance, reported last week that “new county-level data released in December foresees massive growth to continue in Southwest Florida based in part on the latest research from the state that looks all the way out to 2050.”
Every time I read one of these stories offering sunny projections about bringing in lots more residents who need new homes and apartments, one question runs through my head: What are they going to drink?
Look, I know the Florida economy operates like the world’s largest Ponzi scheme — in fact, it’s been suggested we call ourselves the Ponzi State. The whole system depends on a never-ending supply of new people buying homes.
We continue packing in new people like we’re stuffing more clowns in a clown car, but I feel compelled to point out that nobody’s making new water to slake their thirst. There’s no wild-haired Dr. Einstein in a lab repeatedly combining one part of hydrogen with two parts of oxygen. It doesn’t work that way.
Instead, we’re facing watering restrictions, shortages, and widespread drought. Yet we act as though there’s still plenty of water for all the new people.
Florida Taxwatch, not exactly a bunch of radical tree huggers, was warning two years ago that Florida is using so much water that parts of the state would start running out if the Legislature failed to act.
Has the Legislature acted? Nope! Our duly elected dimwits have been more concerned about banning Pride flags and restricting drag shows than making sure everyone has water to drink, bathe in, and flush their toilets.
We’re now seeing desperate local attempts to boost the dwindling water supply with experiments that may not work. One to revive the flow of the Suwannee and Santa Fe Rivers has yet to find a source of funding, yet Florida water managers are already counting on it to make up for draining the river basin.
“We’re not just putting all our eggs in one basket,” Ryan Smart of the Florida Springs Council told me. “We’re throwing all our eggs in the air and hoping a basket appears.”
Vast but not infinite
A lot of people in Florida never think about where their water comes from.
If you asked, they’d probably say it comes from the faucet. Or maybe the bottled water section of the grocery store.
The fact is, some 90% of the water we use for drinking, bathing, and watering our lawns comes from under our feet. Utilities suck the stuff up out of the Floridan Aquifer, a vast pool of freshwater covering about 100,000 square miles.
The aquifer is huge, but it’s not infinite. Refilling it takes plenty of rain. And right now, we’re not getting enough.
Nearly 90% of the state is stuck in a major drought. It’s so dry that 14 counties have imposed burn bans, fearing a wildfire could sweep across the dry acreage.
“Don’t count on any significant rain helping improve Florida’s drought anytime soon,” the Tallahassee Democrat warned recently.
Florida’s water planning and policy is under the control of five water management districts run by a bunch of gubernatorial appointees. Those appointees tend to be either developers or agriculture folks who donated to the governor’s campaign, not experts in water supply.
That’s why they rarely say no to any water-use permits, no matter how outrageously large. They’re like Jim Carrey in “Yes Man,” always giving a green light, never a red.
Ryan Smart via Linkedin
We’re seeing the result of that overly positive policy now. Too much pumping from the aquifer — to irrigate golf courses, boost crops, and provide lush suburban lawns — has lowered the pressure in a number of our taxpayer-owned springs, lessening their once-forceful flow.
“The aquifer is enormous, so we have the luxury of sinking more wells and sinking them deeper,” Smart told me. “Unfortunately, the spring vents all stay the same depth.”
While our water managers rush to accommodate the developers, he said, nature is the one that suffers.
How dry we are
Instead of the Ponzi State, we call ourselves the Sunshine State, but that’s a lie we tell the tourists.
Many of our cities get more annual rainfall than famously soggy Seattle. Four are in the top 10 cities for rainfall in America. The state is hit by about 58 inches of rain every year.
Except right now, our precipitation has dried up as if by prestidigitation.
If you look at the Florida drought map, you’ll see 91% of the state is in the iron grip of a drought. Much of the state shows up as yellow (“abnormally dry”), tan (“moderate drought”), or orange (“severe drought”) from the lack of rain.
The worst spot is around Tallahassee, where conditions are as red as a stop sign, which means “exceptional drought.” No, that doesn’t mean Florida’s legislators drank up all the water. They prefer stronger beverages.
Dave Zierden via FSU
Florida’s official climatologist, David Zierden, said he foresaw this coming last year when we dodged all the hurricanes.
“That was our first indication that this was coming,” he told me.
The Southwest Florida Water Management District has imposed watering restrictions on Citrus, DeSoto, Hardee, Hernando, Hillsborough, Manatee, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Sarasota, and Sumter counties, as well as portions of Charlotte, Highlands, and Lake counties. Those restrictions are scheduled to continue until July.
“The district received lower than normal rainfall during its summer rainy season and now has a 13-inch regional rainfall deficit,” agency officials noted.
The South Florida Water Management District has also imposed year-round landscape watering restrictions across its 16 counties. One of the areas facing serious limits: Cape Coral, billed in the 1950s as Florida’s “Waterfront Wonderland” because it has 400 miles of canals, more than anywhere else on earth. But that’s all saltwater, not fresh.
The St. Johns River Water Management District is restricting water use, too. That’s three water management districts limiting water use by existing homeowners. Yet not one has limited new development.
We used to plan in advance for the utilities, roads, and other needs of our growth, but that went out the window in 2011. Still, the state has prepared a 2025 water plan, and it predicts that lots more water consumption is coming.
“Between 2020 and 2040, the population in Florida is expected to increase by 24%, from 21.6 million to 26.7 million,” the Florida Department of Environmental Protection plan says. “During this same period, it is estimated that Floridians will require 14% more water, or approximately 0.9 billion gallons of water per day.”
That’s why the plan calls for everyone to start thinking about alternatives.
But those are much more expensive.
The C.W. Bill Young Reservoir via Tampa Bay Water
No more cheap water
I used to cover the state’s largest wholesale water utility, Tampa Bay Water. Over and over, I would hear experts say, “The era of cheap water is over in Florida.”
What they meant was that you could no longer just stick another well down in the aquifer or pump a lot more water out. We saw the consequences of that during the Tampa Bay Water Wars. It led to serious damage, to the point that lakes and wetlands dried up.
Bringing those places back to life required finding alternate water sources. Tampa Bay Water built the state’s largest desalination plant using reverse osmosis to convert salty water into fresh.
Then the utility built a system for skimming freshwater from the Hillsborough River and a reservoir that could hold more than 15 billion gallons of water, making it the largest in the state. That allowed the utility to stop pumping so much water out of the ground.
Thanks to the decreased pumping, the lakes and wetlands that had been sucked dry slowly recovered. But it wasn’t enough.
Now, to meet the needs of all the new people who have moved into the area, Tampa Bay Water got permission from the water district last year to take even more water out of the Alafia River. It’s increasing the amount from 60 million gallons a day to 75 million gallons a day.
As a result, Tampa Bay Water is now in a fight with people in Polk County who want the same water. Welcome to Water Wars II: Electric Boogaloo!
But Polk County is also trying something even wilder.
The C.W. Bill Young Reservoir via Tampa Bay Water
Toilet to springs
A couple of years ago, “Imperial” Polk County was recognized as the fastest growing county in America. WTVT-TV reported that “subdivisions are springing up left and right to keep up with the growing population.”
To keep up with that booming growth, Polk has handed out so many water permits that now it’s become desperate. It’s trying a $600 million experiment: Drill into the brackish lower level of the Floridan Aquifer.
But the product from that level will be saltier than George Carlin’s most famous comedy routine. That means it will require so much treatment that it will be much more expensive — by some accounts, 12 times more costly than fresh water.
One of the odder alternatives is coming from Jacksonville. The place known as the River City is trying to make up for pumping so much water out of the ground in North Florida that it’s harming the springs along the Santa Fe and Suwannee rivers, Smart said. The proposed solution: pumping treated wastewater out of the city and injecting it into the ground.
It’s a controversial idea — Suwannee Riverkeeper opposes it, for one, suggesting, “How about Jacksonville get a grip on its water usage?”
At this point, nobody knows who’s going to pay for this billion-dollar plan or even if it will work. But Smart said state water officials are already considering it the ideal way to make up for the water withdrawals and proceeding accordingly.
Otherwise, they might have to admit that we’ve reached the point where we can’t provide enough water for all the people who are jamming into our state now. Welcome to Dry 2026!
Paving recharge zones
As usual when I have a growth and planning question, I called Wayne Daltry. He was in charge of “smart growth” in Lee County waaaaay back when Lee County cared about smart growth.
Wayne Daltry, via subject
He pointed out to me the other problem with so much of the development that’s occurring right now is where it’s being built.
“Our water recharge areas are being developed, and that’s an issue,” Daltry told me.
Those are the places in the landscape where rainfall can soak down into the ground, refilling the aquifer. If the water can’t soak in, it can’t replace what’s being sucked out. Too often, that water winds up being flushed out into the nearest stream or river and carried away, rather than being retained for consumption, he said.
Slap a slab of cement over a swamp and the rain that does fall can’t penetrate the earth to refill our drinking water supply. Fill in wetlands and they can no longer screen out the impurities flowing toward our bays, streams, and rivers.
Then, when we realize that our water supply has shrunk to the point where we can’t use it, it’s too late.
Fortunately, the solution to all this is obvious. It comes from the brilliant movie “Idiocracy.”
Instead of water, we can just pipe a Florida-based sports drink to every new home in Florida. We don’t have to draw it up out of the ground. We just pay the manufacturer and dump it right into the pipes, so people can get it through their faucets.
Will it be expensive? Sure, but at least nobody will go thirsty. Plus, it’s got electrolytes!",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chiquita-Lock-from-Jason-Pimm--1024x747.jpeg,,,2026-01-22 00:35:25.991868

Renee LaMark Muir,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/22/transparency-and-accountability-are-not-anti-law-enforcement/,Excessive actions by ICE agents in Minneapolis and elsewhere are undermining law enforcement and making good policing harder.,"As a former police officer, I am disturbed by the video showing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Agent Jonathan Ross shooting and killing Renee Nicole Good as she attempted to move her car after being boxed in by ICE and other vehicles. 
Good was not suspected of a violent crime. She was a citizen engaged in her constitutionally protected right to peaceful protest, observing enforcement activity in her Minneapolis neighborhood.

State Rep. Renee LaMark Muir

As a current legislator, I assess this case through the framework Connecticut has built to reduce unnecessary risk, protect civil rights, and strengthen public trust. I am concerned that excessive actions by ICE agents are undermining law enforcement and making good policing harder.
Transparency is essential to public confidence in policing. This incident, like many others, was captured on video by bystanders and by the ICE agent himself. Videos, witness statements, and physical evidence should allow investigators to establish the facts clearly. Due process demands investigations free from political pressure or agency interference.
Transparency alone, however, is insufficient. Accountability depends on whether law enforcement agencies operate under clear, enforceable rules that prioritize de-escalation, officer safety, and preservation of life. When agencies fall short of these standards, they must be held accountable.
Connecticut has embedded these principles into law and training. It is vital that residents understand how the 8,000 highly trained law enforcement professionals in Connecticut respond to these types of incidents.
An officer’s fundamental responsibility is to render aid. ICE agents reportedly failed to provide medical assistance, allow a qualified professional to do so, or even check whether Good was alive. Connecticut law requires officers to provide immediate emergency medical care regardless of custody status or who caused the injury.
Connecticut law forbids shooting at a moving vehicle unless it poses an immediate threat to life or involves the escape of a serious felon. Officers are trained to avoid blocking vehicles, positioning themselves near moving cars, or escalating low-level encounters into lethal confrontations. Supervisors actively manage pursuit and containment decisions to minimize risk.
Tactical discipline is deeply embedded in Connecticut training. Officers are taught to continuously assess threats and anticipate outcomes. They are specifically instructed not to stand in front of or behind moving vehicles, not to step into a vehicle’s path, and not to reach inside vehicles during routine encounters. When genuine danger exists, controlled “felony stop” procedures are used to maximize safety for all involved.
Body cameras are standard practice in Connecticut. State law mandates their use during public interactions because they promote transparency, protect officers through objective documentation, and reduce disputes over the use of force. ICE agents appear not to have department-issued cameras, instead relying on personal cell phones — an approach that would not meet Connecticut’s accountability standards.
Officer identification is required. Connecticut law generally prohibits officers from concealing their identities and requires visible name tags and badges, as well as compliance when asked to identify oneself. Public authority must be visible to remain legitimate.
Professionalism requires disciplined decision-making rather than emotional reaction. This skill supports de-escalation, protects officers and civilians, and reduces unnecessary harm.
When agencies depart from these principles, as ICE is clearly doing, public confidence erodes. Allegations of excessive force, enforcement based on race or ethnicity rather than lawful authority, and misleading reporting undermine the integrity of the justice system and weaken community cooperation.
The Minneapolis incident highlights a troubling question: why should accountability depend on whether an officer wears a federal badge or a local one? Public safety standards and civil rights protections should not stop at state lines or agency boundaries. If Connecticut’s model strengthens public and officer safety, accountability, and trust, then federal law enforcement agencies should be held to the same standards.
As a member of the General Assembly’s Judiciary Committee, I support continued investment in high-quality police training and holding federal agents accountable for actions taken in our state that violate our laws and policing standards.
Transparency and accountability are not anti-law enforcement. They are pro-professionalism, pro-public trust, and essential to the rule of law.

The time to act is now.,"No matter where you may go in Connecticut — stores, parks, restaurants or even schools — there will be people using e-cigarette products called vapes. Currently, there is a vaping epidemic in Connecticut, especially among young people. 
According to the Connecticut Department of Public Health, about 16,600 high school students reported using e-cigarette products in 2023 — even though sales of vaping products are restricted to those 21 and older. The DPH also says that 13.3% of adults age 18-34 vape. Why are these numbers so big?



Walk into any smoke shop in Connecticut, and it can look more like a candy store than a drug store, with bright lights, fun colors and cool art designs. If you look at the products, there are hundreds of different flavors including “Pink Lemonade,” “Tropical Rainbow” or “Orange Creamsicle.” You can even find smart vapes, which let you play games and connect to a phone. These marketing tactics used by vape companies and stores are successful, especially with younger people. The flavors are irresistible, and the pretty colors are eye-catching.
Vaping looks exciting until you realize that most of these products contain nicotine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nicotine is a highly addictive drug that can affect brain development up to age 25. This means that every inhale from a flavored vape has the potential to alter a young person’s developing brain, making addiction more likely and harder to break. What starts as a fun flavor can quickly become a habit that vapers struggle to quit.

Connecticut lawmakers need to ban flavored vape products. Fruity and dessert-like flavors are designed to appeal to young people and should not be sold. Young people are getting their hands on these products too early, increasing the risk of health problems and lifelong addiction.
Connecticut bans the sale of tobacco and vapor products to anyone under 21. But there is no statewide ban on flavored e-cigarettes in Connecticut. A ban has been considered by the legislature but never passed. On the federal level, the Food and Drug Administration has a ban on flavored e-cigarettes in cartridge-based systems (pods), but not on disposable ones.
Some might argue that banning flavored vapes could increase the usage of other tobacco products like cigarettes or nicotine pouches because a lot of adults have switched from cigarettes to vaping. But vaping carries great risks. Many vaping products contain chemicals such as diacetyl, which is linked to lung disease, injury and even death, according to the American Heart Association. The DPH says vapes also contain heavy metals like lead and nickel, which are not things anyone should be inhaling on the daily.
Connecticut has earned an F from the American Lung Association for its cowardice on banning flavored vapes. And Connecticut is one of the few states in the Northeast that hasn’t banned flavored vapes. Connecticut needs to do better for communities that are suffering from vaping epidemics.
Connecticut has fallen behind. The state’s lack of action is hurting the health of a generation. If we want to protect children from nicotine addiction and prevent long-term harm, the time to act is now.

Wes Moore (D) told reporters the state will be forced ""to do more with less"" but will protect core priorities. (Photo Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) unveiled a $70.8 billion fiscal 2027 budget proposal Wednesday that he said increases funds for education, housing and police initiatives, while closing a $1.5 billion budget gap without increased taxes or fees.
The budget, the last of Moore’s curent term, comes as the state grapples with deep cuts to the federal workforce and a stale economy.
“We know the numbers and Maryland is going to be forced to do more with less,” Moore said at a news conference to release the budget. “But here is what I want everyone in the state to understand: Being fiscally responsible and being fiscally disciplined does not mean we stop investing in what matters most to the people of the state of Maryland. It does mean that we’re going to be more targeted. We’re going to be more data driven about how we invest.”
The budget relies on cuts and fund transfers or swaps of bonds for cash.
“This budget does not raise taxes or fees on Maryland.” Moore told reporters.
House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) said the budget “is largely based on accounting tricks” that do not make meaningful changes in spending.
“We are spending more than last year, increasing Medicaid and Blueprint education spending, and neither cutting the size of state government nor reducing its costs,” Buckel said in a statement. “Luckily, the stock market and the national economic growth enabled our revenue to continue to grow, creating the illusion that Maryland is on a steady fiscal course, which is not true at all.”

Included in the overall budget is the $27.7 billion state general fund budget — the portion for which the state directly taxes Maryland residents. That’s about $154 million lower than the expected appropriation of nearly $27.9 billion for the current general fund budget, which increased by more than $950 million because of higher than expected spending in programs such as Medicare.
Moore said the budget was developed in consultation with the legislature.
“Our administration did not simply submit this budget to the General Assembly,” Moore said. “We collaborated, and we worked with the General Assembly. The General Assembly members we had the honor of working with, they can see their work, their fingerprints all over this proposed budget.”
To close the projected gap, Moore relies on nearly $1.1 billion in cash transfers. Included in that is $150 million from the local income tax reserve account. Budget officials said the money represents an overpayment to the account that will not have to be paid back.
The budget also includes a number of swaps of bonds for cash.
The state planned to send $167 million to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authorityin the coming year. The payment would have come out of the operating budget. Instead, Moore plans to use the cash to balance the budget. Borrowed money that could be used for other projects such as school construction and renovation will be used for the WMATA payment.
Other transfers include:

$292 million from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund.
$145 million from the Rainy Day fund, taking the balance to 8% of general fund revenues, in line with a legislative recommendation. That amount is higher than the legally required 5% minimum. hhjkii
$187 from the Fiscal Responsibility Fund, an account that holds capital gains taxes — a volatile revenue source.

Moore takes another $100 millions from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund to again give utility customers a one-time payment of $40 to offset high utility bills. The amount is half that given last year.
The SEIF — which is used for energy efficiency and clean energy projects, like programs for low- and moderate-income Marylanders — has ballooned in recent years as utilities haved opted to pay into the fund for “alternative compliance payments” rather than complying with state mandates for the share of renewable energy they must supply.
In fiscal 2025, nearly $365 million worth of alternative compliance payments went into the SEIF, representing about 54% of its proceeds. Previously, these payments had been a minority contributor to the fund.
Solar alternative compliance payments have increased in part because the legislature in 2019 increased the solar energy mandate for utilities, according to a January report from the Maryland Energy Administration. Non-solar payments have soared because energy markets routinely made the alternative compliance payments cheaper than the mandated “renewable energy credits.”
Last year, the governor and legislature faced a $3.3 billion structural budget deficit. The budget was balanced using a combination of cuts, one-time fund transfers and $1.6 billion in tax increases to end the 2025 sessionwith a projected budget surplus of $300 million for the coming year.
But last fall, officials learned the forecast surplus had become a projected deficit approaching $1.6 billion, including $1.2 billion in cash. The administration and lawmakers pointed down Route 50 to the policies of President Donald Trump for the change in the budget.

“Simply put, Donald Trump happened,” said Acting Budget Secretary Yaakov “Jake” Weissmann.
Despite conservative revenue forecasts, Maryland felt the brunt of federal workforce reductions. So far, almost 25,000 federal jobs in Maryland have been cut. Tariffs and inflation also played a role.
Weissman said “what nobody could have predicted was the chaos in D.C. The abdication of responsible governing and the attacks that hurt Maryland more than any other state in the nation, costing 15% of our federal workforce their jobs and increasing budget costs in a variety of ways.”
Del. Jefferson Ghrist (R-Upper Shore), a member of the House Appropriations Committee, blamed the state’s budget problems on profligate spending.
“I have seen nothing in the Governor’s budget proposal that addresses the long-term issues that have created these giant budget holes,” Ghrist said in a statement. “We are just setting Marylanders up for another round of tax increases after the election. It is disappointing.”
The budget also contains some difficult choices including $150 million in cost containments within the Developmental Disabilities Administration. Advocates said the combined cuts including federal match reduces funding by $300 million.
“Since last session, the Moore Administration has engaged with stakeholders to discuss financial and programmatic issues related to DDA programs,” Laura Howell, CEO of the Maryland Association of Community Services, said in a statement. “While those discussions are appreciated, we are concerned about the impact of the proposed FY27 cuts, on top of budget cuts that were sustained in FY26. The current proposal will need to be assessed and refined in order to avoid further negative impacts on Marylanders with developmental disabilities.”
Last year, advocates rallied to restore proposed funding cuts to the Developmental Disabilities Administration.
Local governments will also be asked to dig deeper.
“I would say we’ve worked with our local jurisdictions to come to these solutions,” Moore said. “We’re pushing costs on locals because when locals look at their budgets, they know what percentage of their budgets are also … underwritten by the state. This is just making sure that we are both aligning on priorities and ensuring that there is a measurement of sharing when we think about how we’re going to fund these priorities.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Weissmann, during the news conference, said the budget includes shifting 50% of increased retirement costs in K-12 education, community colleges and libraries to local governments, at an estimated cost of $39 million.
The proposal also flat funds disparity grants to local governments at current year levels.
“Local government aid goes up this year in the budget even with that cost shift,” Weissman said. “Our local governments are receiving more money this year from the state than they did last year.”
Community colleges will also see some state funding formulas capped at a maximum of 3% based on enrollment.
Republican Minority Leader Sen. Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) expressed concerns about shifting costs to local governments. While the budget does not appear to raise taxes or fees, “there is a lot beneath the surface that gives us pause.”
“The proposal shifts additional responsibilities to counties and municipalities, putting local governments in a position where higher local taxes become more likely. It also relies on moving and raiding funds to support ongoing spending,” Hershey said in a statement. “Now that the budget is in the hands of the General Assembly, we’ll see how it ultimately takes shape — but what’s missing is a firm commitment from the Governor to stand against any tax or fee increases that could be added during the legislative process, especially given what Marylanders experienced last year.”
Legislative budget analysts will dissect the budget for House and Senate fiscal committees Monday.
In December, the Joint Spending Affordability Committee recommended the governor hold the line on hiring. The panel asked that Moore create no new positions and fill only critical jobs.
But this budget creates 419 new positions, and converts almost four dozen contractual jobs into state employees. These increases are offset by the elimination of 207 jobs.
Moore is also seeking to recouple some business tax provisions in President Donald Trump’s signature tax-cut legislation. The budget anticipates that Maryland tax code will adopt three provisions in the federal law: the research and experimentation expenditure deduction; small-business expensing; and the business interest deduction.
Doing so will reduce state revenues by about $100 million. Budget officials said they believe the reductions will be offset $132 million by decoupling from two other tax provisions in the bill. A large portion of that savings goes away in three years as some provisions expire.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)A gunshot wound to the left temple likely killed Renee Good, according to an independent autopsy released Wednesday by Good’s family’s attorneys. 
ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Good in her car on Jan. 7 in south Minneapolis as Good and her wife protested ICE agents. 
The preliminary findings of the autopsy, conducted by a “highly respected and credentialed medical pathologist,” per the press release, attests that Good suffered three clear gunshot wounds: one to the left forearm; one to the right breast; and one to the left temple, which exited the right side of her head. 
The autopsy also found a graze wound from a bullet, but did not specify the location. 
The shots to the arm and breast were “were not immediately life-threatening,” according to the autopsy results. 
The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office has not yet released its autopsy results.
Federal prosecutors are not expected to press charges against Ross. President Donald Trump and other top officials have said Ross was acting in self-defense. 
Federal agencies are blocking state and local law enforcement from accessing evidence, creating obstacles for any potential state charges against Ross.
Good’s family is represented by Antonio Romanucci, who represented the family of George Floyd with Ben Crump and won a $27 million civil settlement with the city of Minneapolis. 
Video of the shooting shows Ross fired the shots as Good was trying to drive away. (Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has called Good a “terrorist” who was trying to hit Ross with her car.)
After Ross shot Good, ICE agents did not allow a man who said he was a physician to help Good. No one attempted to provide CPR until more than 10 minutes after Ross shot her, according to MPR News.

Senate Bill 2403 would authorize the Bank of North Dakota to issue an emergency low-interest operating loan of up to $5 million to a hospital in financial distress. The bill was proposed by a trio of District 31 lawmakers to stabilize the Jacobson Memorial Hospital in Elgin. 
The hospital is in danger of closing its doors and is operating payroll to payroll due to years of financial mismanagement and leadership turnover, a representative of the hospital’s board testified Wednesday. 
“Keeping this hospital operational will save lives,” said Rep. Karen Rohr, R-Mandan, one of the bill sponsors.

Some lawmakers expressed concern the most recent audit and other financial information available for Jacobson Memorial Hospital is from 2023. Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, and Rep. Keith Kempenich, R-Bowman, said they hope the state-owned Bank of North Dakota will scrutinize the hospital’s financials before approving a loan. 
“I do think we should approve this bill. It’s an important one,” Cleary said. “But I do have serious concerns that we don’t have more up-to-date financial information about this organization.”
The Joint Appropriations Committee recommended a do pass for the bill with an amendment. While the original bill proposed $10 million for the program, enough for two $5 million loans in case another hospital needs support, the amendment cut the funding in half. 
Matt Hager, who joined the hospital’s board 11 months ago, told lawmakers Wednesday the board is in the process of implementing cost-cutting measures and reforming billing practices, and parted ways with the former CEO in November. 
But the hospital is $4 million in debt with interest rates between 7% and 15%, according to documents submitted by Hager. The loan authorized by the bill would be capped at 2% interest and would enable the hospital to restructure its debt, allow its business reforms to take effect, and give it time to take advantage of the Rural Health Transformation Program funding in the coming years. 
“We can completely turn the tide and take Jacobson from surviving to thriving,” Hager said. 
The hospital expects to reach positive cash flow by December 2026, the board member testified.

The Jacobson Memorial Hospital provides care to residents of Grant, Morton, Sioux, Hettinger and Adams counties. The hospital employs 130 people, representing 5% of Grant County’s population, and contributes an estimated $11.2 million to the local economy directly and indirectly, according to numbers provided by Hager. 
The hospital’s closure would likely have a domino effect and force the shutdown of clinics in Elgin, Richardton and Glen Ullin. The patients responsible for an estimated 800 emergency room visits annually would have to travel an hour or more to the next nearest hospital. The local ambulance service, staffed and operated by the hospital, covers 900 square miles and also would likely close, according to Hager’s testimony. 
“If we do not receive your approval today, we will not quit,” Hager said. “We will continue to pursue every avenue while operating the hospital as efficiently as possible.”
The bill will now go to the floor for consideration by the full Senate, which convenes at 8:30 a.m. Thursday.

House Bill 1624, sponsored by Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, mirrors a constitutional ballot measure that would require the state to cover the cost of lunch and breakfast for all K-12 students.
The Together for Free School Meals coalition is gathering signatures for the measure with hopes to have voters decide the issue during the November election.
 
North Dakota Monitor special session coverage


House members of the committee voted 17-5 and Senate members voted 8-7 in support of Nathe’s bill. His proposal attempts to put the meal program in state statute, rather than the state constitution, which would make it easier for lawmakers to amend if the cost becomes unsustainable.
But several lawmakers expressed concerns Wednesday that even in statute, a meal program would be difficult for lawmakers to cut in the future if the state could not afford it. Some expressed concerns about potential drops in state oil tax revenue. The bill is projected to cost $65 million for the 2026-27 school year. 
Another bill concerning school meals, House Bill 1627, sponsored by Rep. Ty Dressler, R-Richardton, would increase the state’s free and reduced school lunch program to include families earning up to 300% the federal poverty limit, which is about $96,000 for a family of four.
Lawmakers were not able to reach consensus on Dressler’s bill and advanced the measure to the House without a recommendation. The House is scheduled to convene at 8:30 a.m. Thursday.

Rep. Jon Nelson, R-Rugby, was among those who favored Nathe’s bill.
“We can bet yes or no whether it (the ballot measure) will pass or not, but we’re playing Russian roulette with that decision, if we allow the constitutional measure to go forward,” Nelson said. “And I would hope we would allow future legislatures to change it, if they have to.”
House Minority Leader Rep. Zac Ista, D-Grand Forks, said providing school meals helps families who are struggling with affordability right now.
“I think there can be some joy at the prospect of an opportunity to send $65 million back to the taxpayers,” Ista said. 
Sen. Jonathan Sickler, R-Grand Forks, said his local school district is cutting back electives and raising extra curricular fees due to budgetary issues.
“It’s an issue of priorities,” Sickler said. “And the feedback I’m getting from people in my district is the priorities are different than passing free lunch and free breakfast at this point.”
Rep. David Monson, R-Osnabrock, voted against the measure and called Nathe’s bill “pure socialism.”
“I really hate this bill,” Monson said. “How does every democracy or republic end? People start voting free money for themselves.”

Immigration crackdown betrays the rule of law, accountability and respect that draw new citizens to the U.S.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  David Moats: America’s promise of freedom is being tested.","This commentary is by David Moats, of Salisbury. He is editorial page editor emeritus at the Rutland Herald, where he won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for a series of editorials on Vermont’s civil union law.



Twenty-three new citizens from 12 countries took the oath of allegiance to the United States at the federal courthouse in Burlington on Jan. 14. They came from four continents and represented a slice of America as diverse as might be expected. 
What united them was their pledge—to a nation and a Constitution establishing freedom, equality, and the rule of law.
In the context of our time, such a pledge might require a leap of faith. No mention was heard that day of death and intimidation on the streets of Minneapolis, or of the crackdown on immigration that has swept up thousands across the country. 
Instead, it was a day to celebrate immigration and the freedom and opportunity that drew the 23 new citizens here—from Jamaica and Brazil, from South Korea and Vietnam, from Iraq and Sri Lanka, from Nepal and Peru, from Slovakia and France, from Canada and the United Kingdom. 
Kevin J. Doyle, U.S. magistrate judge, presided over what he called a “very joyous” day when the “essence of our American democracy” was on full display. 
His own parents were naturalized citizens, immigrants from Canada, seeking the opportunity and freedoms that have drawn immigrants here for centuries. He said the day’s ceremony offered a chance “to reflect on those freedoms with fresh eyes.”
It’s worth considering the preconditions that allow those freedoms to flourish in a democracy. One is respect for the individual, embodied in laws protecting individual rights and restraining the arbitrary power of the government. 
Lying, on the other hand, is an act of disrespect—a government that lies to the people disrespects the people. The killing of Renee Good by an agent of Immigration and Customs Enforcement was bad enough; the lying that followed was symptomatic of the corruption and rot pervading the present administration. 
Consider the way that law enforcement officials, under ordinary circumstances, are required to act. Officers making an arrest must have a warrant or cause, which means arrests are not arbitrary. 
When action by an officer results in death or injury, an inquiry necessarily follows to determine if there was justification for the officer’s actions. Oversight of law enforcement is a necessary protection for the people, and responsible law enforcement officials know it.
Law enforcement officers are trained in how to react in all kinds of dangerous situations. Recourse to deadly force is sometimes warranted, but seldom. 
A motorist disobeying an officer’s orders and driving away is not committing a capital crime. All it would take to hold the motorist accountable would be to take down the license plate number and issue a warrant.
But instead of holding law enforcement accountable, President Trump and other high officials scarcely paused before they turned their wrath on Renee Good, accusing her of being a domestic terrorist and of threatening the lives of ICE agents. 
They issued these accusations in the face of video recordings that the world could see, showing the unnecessary and wanton killing of someone whose only offense was to try to avoid trouble by driving away.
In the aftermath, federal officials have said they will continue to block or impede any state or local efforts to hold ICE accountable for Renee Good’s death. 
It’s worth asking what would happen in Vermont should a similar incident occur here. The ICE presence is not as overwhelming in Vermont as in Minnesota, but anti-ICE protests are frequent, and they can be expected to continue as long as the Trump administration’s unnecessary and brutal crackdown continues. 
Vermonters ask simply that people in Vermont, citizens or not, be respected. Thousands of immigrants from Latin America live here, an integral part of the economy and community. Whether or not they have documentation, they deserve respect, as do Vermonters standing up in their defense. 
ICE agents complain about the lack of respect that people are showing them. They ought to search their souls.
The lack of respect originates from the top—from the lies told by the president and others—and from the brutality of the sweeping crackdown. 
Responsible police officers know that their arrival on the scene inevitably inspires anxiety and fear. It goes with the territory. Officers generally have thick skins, and they learn to deal with people’s fears by de-escalating tense situations and trying to put people at ease. That isn’t what’s happening in Minnesota.
Many of the 23 new citizens at the latest naturalization ceremony come from places where civil unrest has been a fact of life. In some of those places, democracy is an aspiration rather than a reality, and the government can’t be counted on to protect dissidents.
The United States has had a long tradition of protest, citizens raising dissident voices to oppose injustice. It also has a long tradition of cracking down on dissident voices. 
The Palmer Raids of 1919 and 1920 came in response to the Red Scare. The white supremacist opposition to civil rights protests was visible in the film record of fire hoses, billy clubs, police dogs, and in Klan-inspired bombings and murders.
It is the freedom to protest—in opposition to lies and brutality—that inspires people at home and around the world. The people of the United States need to make good on the promise of freedom and respect that continues to draw new citizens to this country.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Just over half of Maryland’s hospitals were able to reduce their emergency department wait times last year, but state officials acknowledged that more work is needed as the state pushes to improve Maryland’s infamously lengthy emergency room wait times.
The remarks came at a joint meeting Wednesday of the Senate Finance and the House Health committees Wednesday. They also come almost two years after lawmakers created a commission to reduce average emergency department wait times, which have traditionally been among the longest in the nation,
“I would urge some expediency to this,” Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Anne Arundel and Howard) said during the joint hearing. “This is a problem that’s facing all of us and all of our districts.”
Extended emergency room wait times was just one of the issues brought up in the four-hour joint committee meeting Wednesday, with most of the discussion centered around the complex maneuvering as the state shifts to a new hospital payment model.
Marylanders have for years faced long waits in hospital emergency departments, with some patients facing upwards of 24-hours in emergency room lobbies before seeing a provider for their urgent health needs.
Lawmakers look to take wide-ranging approach to reducing Maryland’s emergency room wait times

Officials with the Maryland Department of Health and the Health Services Cost Review Commission have been studying the issue for years and looking for solutions to help bring wait times down.
One solution is to make sure the emergency department is not the first option patients look to when they need care. Health Secretary Meena Seshamani testified Wednesday that the Moore administration has been taking steps to improve access to primary care and preventative care, so that Marylanders can receive health services before they land in the emergency rooms.
Jonathan Kromm, executive director of the Health Services Cost Review Commission, said that 22 of Maryland’s 41 hospitals improved their emergency department length of stay over the 2025 calendar year. He said one of the main drivers of extended emergency room wait times are patients he referred to as ER “boarders,” or patients who spend an inordinate amount of time waiting for follow-up care and tying up available beds in the process. Kromm said that hospitals have been taking steps to free-up beds more frequently.
“These are patients who are staying in the ED for beyond the point at which they’ve been seen and diagnosed by a provider,” Kromm said. “They are awaiting either admission to an in-patient bed, or they are awaiting a transfer, or they are awaiting some other type of discharge or transition of care.”
Kromm told lawmakers that the Emergency Department Wait Times Reduction Commission, a state task force established in July 2024, will finalize a list of “concrete recommendations” for hospitals by the end of the year on reducing emergency room wait times.

“It’s a very real problem,” he said. “There’s no reason we should be at the very bottom, if not, close to bottom, of states when it comes to ED wait times. We really need to move this quickly. It’s been a year and a half and we need some recommendations.”
Meanwhile, Del. Aaron M. Kaufman (D-Montgomery) worries that the federal budget reconciliation bill HR 1, also called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” could undo some of the progress state hospitals have made in reducing their wait ER wait times.
Under HR 1, new work requirements for Medicaid eligibility and other measures may lead to thousands of Marylanders losing their health care coverage. Those without insurance tend to delay health care until their situation is more dire and end up in the emergency room.
“Thank you for your commitment to get people to a bed faster, because I was on a gurney once for 13 hours in the ER while I was waiting for a bed,” Kaufman said. “But I fear that the gains we have made have the potential to fall away as a result of the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act.
“Because instead of getting people’s strep throat and ear infections taken care of at urgent care or some other entity, people will no longer be able to afford their insurance so they’ll come to the emergency room,” Kaufman said.

Mike Dunleavy speaks during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Jan. 21, 2026. (Photo byJames Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy is expected Thursday evening to detail his plans for a long-term plan to balance Alaska’s expenses and revenue.
“There will be a temporary, seasonal sales tax concept put forward for discussion with the legislature,” Dunleavy said Wednesday during a cabinet meeting open to reporters. 
Will state lawmakers approve that idea?
“I don’t have the answer to that until we start having discussions,” he said.
Since 2015, Alaska’s annual budget process has frequently been snarled by low oil prices that have made it difficult for legislators and governors to balance the state’s books without spending from savings. 
Alaska relies on oil revenue for almost a third of its general-purpose revenue, and for most of the past decade, the price of North Slope crude has been relatively low. 
Alaska has never had a statewide sales tax, and it hasn’t had a statewide income tax since 1980. 
Since 2018, the state’s No. 1 source of general-purpose revenue has been the proceeds of the Alaska Permanent Fund, followed by oil. 
Dunleavy’s proposal will mark a major shift for the governor, who is term-limited and in the final year of his second term. For his first seven years in office, the governor has attempted to resolve the long-term imbalance in state finances by cutting services and spending. 
On the rare occasions that legislators have passed new tax measures, Dunleavy has vetoed them, saying he will accept no tax bills that are not part of a complete fiscal solution.
The governor is expected to unveil his proposal for a complete solution on Thursday. He said he views any tax measures as a temporary “bridge” until the North Slope begins producing more oil and a proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline comes to fruition.
“The proposal and the fiscal plan has multiple components, and basically what it is, it’s a road map to inject stability, especially over the next five years when revenue is not quite what will be in the out-years,” he said.
In addition to proposing a statewide sales tax, the governor is expected to propose bills changing oil taxes and the Permanent Fund dividend.
“There’s always room for negotiation, but there’s two sides. That (goes) both ways,” he said.
Dunleavy’s remarks came during a Wednesday cabinet meeting that saw the leaders of state departments praise Dunleavy and point to ways in which the state’s position has improved since he entered office.
Crime is down, commissioners said, statewide employment is expected to reach a new historic high this year, and the state’s gross domestic product is also up.
Alaska remains near the bottom of national rankings in educational performance and violent crime, but Dunleavy said he wanted to emphasize that many of the state’s problems are improving.
“We wanted to make sure that people in Alaska know that … there’s a lot happening. These people are working hard. State employees are working hard. There’s a lot going on,” Dunleavy said. “It is a safer place. Is it the safest place in the country? No. That’s a motivator to keep going. We are creating more jobs. Can we, should we, do better? Absolutely. Keep going.”

Steve Conway, a liberal lion and unapologetic voice for labor throughout a 34-year career in the Washington state Legislature, announced Wednesday he will not seek reelection this fall.
“This will be my last session in the Legislature, and I can tell you, it was a hard decision,” he told colleagues on the Senate floor. “I have to turn the page, start a new chapter. I love all of you. I have loved this place.”
Conway, 81, of south Tacoma, has represented the 29th Legislative District in Pierce County since winning a special election in 1993. He spent 18 years in the House before winning the Senate seat in 2010 following the retirement of Rosa Franklin. He is the longest actively serving Democrat in Washington’s state Legislature, according to the Senate Democratic Caucus.
Democratic state Rep. Sharlett Mena, D-Tacoma, is expected to run for the seat. 
“She has my full support,” said her district seatmate, Rep. Melanie Morgan, D-Spanaway. 
Morgan, who is in her eighth year and one of the caucus’s senior members, said the two lawmakers did discuss the situation. “We thought that would be best for the district,” she said.
The strongly Democratic district encompasses south and east Tacoma, Parkland, parts of Spanaway and east Lakewood. The reservation of the Puyallup Tribe is partly in the district.
Conway is vice chair of the Labor and Commerce Committee and serves on the Ways and Means and Rules Committee. He is also Senate president pro tem.
His announcement was anticipated as he had not raised any money toward reelection since July 2024. In December, he told the Standard he would make his decision public at the end of this year’s legislative session.
On Wednesday, as he walked off the floor, he said he knew people were talking and wanted to make it public. He’s hanging up his legislative cleats to be with family, knowing he would be 86 years old if he did another term. 
“My wife needs me. My family needs me,” he said.
Conway graduated from the University of Oregon and served as a Fulbright fellow at the London School of Economics.
Prior to entering elected office, Conway worked as a labor relations specialist for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local 81. 
In the Legislature, he’s been a stalwart voice for workers, helping develop the state’s collective bargaining laws, unemployment insurance program, workers’ compensation system, apprenticeship program, and Paid Family and Medical Leave program.
Conway also serves on the legislative committee that provides oversight for the state’s pension system and on the Joint Committee on Veterans’ and Military Affairs.
In his tenure, he’s abetted efforts to expand the University of Washington Tacoma, build the LeMay Car Museum, the UW Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies, and most recently, the Asia Pacific Cultural Center.

This requires a healthy state budget with adequate revenue, and for state lawmakers to disinvest in programs that cause harm. 
Yet, for decades, Washington has spent billions of taxpayer dollars subsidizing a sentencing system that prioritizes length over common sense. House Bill 1125, a bill that lawmakers will consider this legislative session, would establish a responsible, merit-based process for courts to evaluate whether continued incarceration still serves the public, especially when a person has demonstrated substantial rehabilitation and presents a low risk of reoffense.
This proposed legislation addresses a costly human reality: people — many of them older, medically vulnerable, or long rehabilitated — remain incarcerated for decades under punitive policies that no longer reflect Washington’s laws, sentencing standards, and public-safety evidence. Many are serving terms determined by sentence enhancements that lawmakers have since reformed or repealed, or plan to. At a time when we’re facing state- and federal-level budget crises, putting money toward this kind of long-term incarceration is not just inhumane, it’s fiscally reckless. 
Decades of criminal legal policies that favor white people with wealth and power have disproportionately driven incarceration rates up for people of color, people with disabilities, and people living in poverty — concentrating harm in communities already facing systemic barriers.
In 2024, Washington spent an average of $75,576 per year to incarcerate a single person — an 84% increase since 2019. Costs are even higher in older or higher-security facilities, where annual expenses can exceed $115,000. For people who are seniors or are living with serious medical conditions, the cost of incarceration can be at least three times higher per person due to the rising price of medical care and specialized housing. Altogether, Washington now spends close to $1 billion annually to incarcerate about 13,000 people in state corrections, many of whom have already served decades for convictions that would receive far shorter sentences today.
As corrections spending grows, lawmakers are forced to make cuts elsewhere — often to higher education, housing assistance, behavioral health care, and youth programs that directly support long-term public safety and economic stability.
Recent higher education cuts show the impacts of these tradeoffs. For this biennial budget, lawmakers eliminated $89 million from the Washington Student Loan Program, making college less affordable for Washington families. Dollars funding incarceration cannot be used to reduce tuition, expand financial aid, or stabilize public universities, all of which should be public priorities to educate the next generation under a finite budget.
Despite these rising costs, outcomes do not improve. Research consistently shows that excessively long sentences do not deter crime. People tend to age out of the years when interpersonal criminal offenses are most likely to occur. Studies of individuals released after decades of incarceration — particularly those sentenced as youth — show exceptionally low rates of reoffense.
HB 1125 allows courts to evaluate certain cases after a person has served at least 10 years, based on extensive evidence of rehabilitation and merit. Eligibility is not automatic; it must be earned, and petitions are assessed individually. Some of the more extreme categories of offenses — including aggravated murder and persistent offender sentences — are excluded from eligibility. 
The bill prioritizes individuals whose circumstances make continued incarceration both least necessary and most costly: older people, those with serious or terminal medical conditions, and people sentenced as children or young adults to extraordinarily long terms. Anyone whose term is modified must complete a minimum of five years of community custody, ensuring accountability, supervision, and structured reentry support.
HB 1125 will expand survivor support, recognizing that sustainable public safety requires both accountability and healing—and neither is served when prison budgets grow unchecked while survivor services are cut. Federal support for victim services has been slashed by more than 50% since 2018, forcing many programs to reduce services or close altogether. HB 1125 would allow Washington to redirect resources toward prevention, stability, and healing, while ensuring that individuals earn the opportunity to be evaluated based on rehabilitation and accountability. 
Washington’s budget crisis gives us a clear choice: continue funneling money into extreme sentences with little public benefit, or adopt an approach that strengthens communities and stops using taxpayer dollars to punish an aging and sick population. HB 1125 is an obvious and necessary path forward.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Prison-Flag-2019-700x467-1.jpg,,,2026-01-22 00:35:25.991868

(Will Ruzanski/Utah News Dispatch)Chanting echoed through the Capitol’s marble halls as transgender Utahns and their allies marched from the front steps to the rotunda on Wednesday, calling on lawmakers to halt a set of bills targeting transgender people. More than 60 people participated in the protest. 
Anti-transgender bill among ‘most harmful and outrageous’ Utah LGBTQ+ advocates have seen

“We’re here because trans people are continuously being attacked in Utah and across the country. Frankly, we’ve had enough,” said Veronika DaVil, a drag artist who organized the protest.
This marks the fifth consecutive year with multiple bills targeting transgender people from Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature. One bill in particular — HB183, which seeks to implement sweeping changes to gender and sex designations, eliminating protections for transgender Utahns — has been described as the “most harmful and outrageous” bill LGBTQ+ advocates have seen. 
“I’m anticipating a big fight,” said Rep. Sahara Hayes, D-Millcreek, Utah’s only openly queer legislator who has publicly said she’s the partner of a transgender woman. While speaking to reporters on Wednesday, she described the bill as “possibly the most egregious anti-trans bill that I’ve seen being run by the state at all.”

DaVil told Utah News Dispatch transgender people are a “marginalized community that keeps being attacked over and over again to distract from larger issues,” emphasizing that “people need to stand up for the trans community because they can’t do it by themselves.”
“This is such a small community,” she said. “Attacking trans people won’t make rent cheaper. Attacking trans people won’t make our groceries more affordable. It is a smoke screen.”
Rep. Jen Dailey-Provost, D-Salt Lake City, expressed her concerns with HB183 during House Democrats’ media availability, saying it “could not be more mean spirited, misguided.”
Kree Arias, a transgender man and member of the grassroots activist group Utah March, described LGBTQ+ groups as being “under attack.” He told Utah News Dispatch that protesters chose to come to the Capitol during the Legislature’s first week back in session to increase visibility for the community.
“We are here to take a stand and make sure that people are aware that we are here, and we’re not going anywhere,” he said.

Arias worries Republicans in Utah’s Legislature won’t listen to queer input, saying, “I feel like saying things is just going to be repetitive.”
“I would like to just sit down with them and be like, ‘hey, you know, this is who we are,’” he said. “I don’t want to talk about our transness or our gayness, or any of that. I want to talk about who we are as people. We’re brothers, we’re sisters, we’re uncles.”
He said the transgender community in Utah is here to stay. “We’re people, and this is what we’re about, being ourselves, being beautiful and proud,” he said.

Legislative Management convened an interim committee in the fall to guide the state’s grant application and prepare the proposal, House Bill 1623.
The Rural Health Transformation Program, passed by Congress last year, sets aside $50 billion through 2030 for states. Each state is guaranteed a minimum of $500 million and is eligible to receive up to $1 billion.
 
North Dakota Monitor special session coverage


The federal government in late December awarded North Dakota $199 million for the first year of the grant.
The state plans to dedicate $33.4 million of the award award on technology, $116 million to expand health care access in rural areas, $32.2 million to address workforce issues and $17.1 million to promote healthy lifestyles.
The budget bill, as currently written, gives the department the authority to move money between these categories as needed.
Interim Health and Human Services Commissioner Pat Traynor said organizations can use the money for a wide variety of purposes. A community gym could apply for a grant to purchase new equipment, for instance, Traynor said.
Clinics could seek grant money to purchase automatic sweepers and moppers to free up staff to handle other tasks, too, he added.
Traynor also suggested that health care facilities apply for a grant to improve their cyber security.
Carlotta McCleary, spokesperson for the Mental Health Advocacy Network, testified in support of the bill. McCleary said she hopes the program money will be used to invest in improving children’s mental health services across the state — including for crisis intervention programs, peer support groups and temporary housing.
Tracee Capron, executive director of HIA Health, said her organization hopes to use grant money to expand its palliative care and hospice care to rural and tribal communities across the state. 
“What’s held us back from expansion was having the resources,” she said in testimony before the Joint Appropriations Committee.
The state must obligate all $199 million by Oct. 30 and spend it within the following year.

“Make sure your entities know when DHHS comes out with applications, they need to apply,” Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, a Williston Republican and co-chair of the Joint Appropriations Committee told lawmakers.
All grant applications must be approved by the federal government.
Grant money will be provided on a reimbursement basis. Once the state and federal government agree to fund an expense, a local organization will spend the money and submit receipts for reimbursement afterward.
Traynor said the agency won’t be adding more full-time employees to help implement the program. Instead, it will hire contract workers. 
“We’re not gonna grow state government,” he said.
Gov. Armstrong urges lawmakers to stay focused on rural health care as North Dakota session opens

Traynor said the department does not know how much it will cost the state to stand up the grant program, but cannot spend more than 10% of its award on administrative costs.
The budget bill authorizes the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services to spend roughly $397.9 million for the 2025-2027 budget cycle — the amount the state expects to receive for the first two years of the Rural Health Transformation Program. The legislation would become effective immediately upon its passage.
Lawmakers approved an amendment brought by Rep. Don Vigesaa, R-Cooperstown, to allow the state-owned Bank of North Dakota to provide up to $40 million in short-term loans to approved grant applicants while they’re waiting for their expenses to be reimbursed by federal money.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The Maryland Office of the Public Defender laid out a legislative agenda Wednesday that calls for more funding for the office as well changes to sentencing and search laws, among others, that will help public defenders to their jobs.
“We are tired, bone tired, of fighting a system that was designed to fail the very people that we represent,” Public Defender Natasha Dartigue during a chilly rally on Lawyers Mall.
Dartigue, joined by lawmakers and advocates, recalled the words of the late author and activist James Baldwin, who said, “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”
“So we’re here today to face it, to speak with truth and conviction as to what Marylanders need to know and hear, and what our dedicated representatives here in Annapolis need to do in the remaining 83 days of session,” she said.
That includes providing more resources for her office and passing  legislation to end the state’s practice of automatically charging youth as adults.
Dartigue is also calling for passage of Del. Charlotte Crutchfield’s (D-Montgomery) “Know Before They Knock” bill, which would require that police or social services workers provide oral and written notice to parents or caretakers of their rights if they are involved in an investigation of alleged child abuse or neglect. The bill failed to get out of committee in 2025 General Assembly.
The rally was joined by several lawmakers, including Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County), Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery) and Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), the new chair of the Judiciary Committee, who spoke in support of the public defenders. Others, like Del. N. Scott Phillips (D-Baltimore County), pressed for their own bills that are supported by the office.
Phillips, one of the first speakers at the rally, and Sen. Charles Sydnor III (D-Baltimore County) are both reintroducing bills this year that would reclassify some “non-safety related” offenses listed as secondary traffic offenses instead of primary violations, that would allow police to make a stop. Those include infractions like driving without an illuminated license plate, having excessive window tint or expired plates.

Drivers could still be cited for any of those violations, but only after being pulled over for another, primary violation.
Sydnor, who also attended Wednesday’s rally, presented his bill Tuesday during a nearly two-hour hearing of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee. He said this year’s version – Senate Bill 55 – would keep driving without a functioning headlight or taillights and driving in a bus-only lane as primary violations.
Sydnor emphasized that his bill seeks to not only reduce racial disparities in traffic stops but also protect officers.
“Categorizing non-safety related traffic stops that are disproportionately enforced on Black and brown Marylanders will enhance public safety by refocusing strained police resources on serious traffic offenses that threaten road safety and rebalancing police workload towards violent crime,” Sydnor said Tuesday.
“Through ongoing dialogue, we have significantly narrowed and altered this legislation from last year, and have struck a strong and smart balance with equity and safety concerns,” he said then.
‘Not what exists in Maryland’
The Governor’s Office of Crime Prevention and Policy’s traffic safety dashboard showed that in 2024, Blacks made up about 31% of the state’s population but ccounted for 42.4% of the 537,226 traffic stops that year. In comparison, whites made up almost 57% of the state’s population, but accounted for 38.1% of all traffic stops.
The dashboard also showed that while there were fewer traffic stops overall in 2023, at almost 483,000, the racial breakdown was essentially the same, with Blacks accounting for 43% of stops and whites making up 39.2%.
A polite, but firm, back-and-forth dialogue took place between Dartigue and Sen. William Folden (R-Frederick) at Tuesday’s hearing, when Dartigue reiterated how Black Marylanders are stopped more often than other drivers.
“I’ve heard of it from every person that came up, and I appreciate that,” said Folden, a recently retired police officer. “What I’m telling you is there’s other things that you are missing and it’s not about officer safety.
“It’s not even really necessarily about officer resources being applied elsewhere. It’s about stopping them from enforcing certain traffic laws that result in stops that potentially lead to other unfortunate arrests,” he said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“It would be a non-issue if everyone was stopped equally, but that is not what exists in Maryland,” Dartigue said.
The traffic-stop legislation got a boost Tuesday with testimony from Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) who offered several amendments, that include allowing a police officer to pull over a driver who commits more than one secondary violation and requiring that an officer inform a driver for all the reasons for a traffic stop.
“We think that we can achieve common ground, consensus around all these amendments to make [the bill] stronger,” he said.
No hearing dates have yet been set for Phillips’ version of the bill, which has been jointly assigned to the Judiciary and Environment and Transportation committees.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Natasha-Dartigue-1-21-2026-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-22 04:37:18.885640

Whether it delivers real affordability will depend less on process and far more on what happens if meaingful recommendations hit the Legislature.","GOV. HEALEY made two splashy health care policy announcements last week. The question now is whether there is steak behind the sizzle.
First, she asked the Division of Insurance to draft regulations barring commercial insurers from requiring prior authorization for prescriptions and care involving many routine and essential services. Second, she announced the creation of a 30-member Health Care Affordability Working Group, charged with developing “concrete proposals to reduce health system costs and ultimately make health care more affordable for patients, families, and employers.”
Eliminating prior authorization for routine care is, frankly, a no-brainer—and a path that some of our insurers already were on. The creation of a new Affordability Working Group potentially represents a much bigger development. Given the severity of the health care affordability crisis facing Massachusetts households, businesses, and the state budget itself, we should all hope this initiative leads to significant policy breakthroughs. But hope alone won’t get us there. 
One way to assess the likelihood of success is to view the announcement through the lens of some skeptics. What follows is a composite of the arguments that I have heard since the announcement from some consumer advocates, health policy experts, and a few business and health care leaders. Most of them share my hope that the working group produces meaningful recommendations that lead to concrete action – but are worried that too often in these situations the status quo prevails.  
The Political Skeptic 
“Here goes Gov. Healey, kicking off an election year with a big announcement about health care affordability and access. It plays well politically, aligns neatly with national Democratic messaging, and allows her to say she’s taking action. But let’s be honest: Prior authorization isn’t disappearing. Plenty of patients will still face it, just now for a narrower set of services. And though the state Medicaid program now says it will also eliminate prior authorization for routine services, that still leaves state employees covered through the Group Insurance Commission without such relief.” 
“As for the new affordability working group, we’ve seen this movie before. Even if it produces solid ideas, there’s no guarantee the Legislature will act. The state’s large and dominant hospital systems seem to always be able to thwart meaningful cost-containment legislation from moving forward. And until recently, health care hasn’t exactly been a signature issue for this governor—except when crisis forced her hand, as with the Steward collapse. If she’s serious, why not file legislation now and fight for it?” 
The Cost Skeptic 
“Getting insurers out of the exam room is a good thing. But let’s not oversell the savings. The scope of the prior authorization prohibition is limited, and health care utilization – and therefore costs — may even increase. Administrative savings will be modest since insurers and providers will still need staff for non-routine authorizations. 
“And let’s not forget, people in self-insured employer plans—who make up the majority of privately insured residents—may still face these requirements. Employers, not insurers, set the rules there. So this reform may feel good, but it’s unlikely to bend the cost curve in a meaningful way.” 
The Institutional Skeptic 
“Why do we need a new health care affordability working group at all? We’ve had the state Health Policy Commission since 2012. Its staff has produced some of the most rigorous analyses in the country, documenting how Massachusetts—after early success—has now fallen back into unsustainable cost growth at the system, employer, and household levels. 
“The problem isn’t a lack of diagnosis. It’s a lack of a clear prescription in the form of legislative action. The Health Policy Commission has made serious recommendations—on price growth, market power, and payment reform—but the Legislature has punted on nearly all of them. Other states have moved ahead with versions of these ideas — Maryland, Rhode Island, California, Oregon, Washington, and others. Massachusetts is now playing policy catch-up. 
“And let’s not forget the Primary Care Task Force, created just last year. Legislative leaders involved in that effort have already signaled that its recommendations are likely to advance. If the new working group is going to add value, it must look beyond primary care and tackle tougher issues: health care provider price growth, hospital global budgets, pharmaceutical pricing, pharmacy benefit manager practices, site-neutral payments, and out-of-network billing.” 
The Governance Skeptic 
“Yes, it’s encouraging to see stronger employer representation on the working group. Employers are absorbing double-digit premium increases year after year. But the group is still dominated by traditional health care interests—providers, health care systems, and unions—whose financial stakes are deeply embedded in the status quo. 
“That raises a real concern: Will this group be able to advance recommendations that meaningfully cut against the interests of those in the room—especially large hospital systems and biopharma companies that have repeatedly prevailed on Beacon Hill? 
“There are also open questions about leadership. Working group co-chair Lisa Murray, the head of Citizens Bank of Massachusetts, may bring a strong commercial insurance affordability lens. But what about her co-chair, Kate Walsh? As former secretary of health and human services and, before that, a health system CEO, will she be guided by the fiscal realities she witnessed during recent bailouts of Medicaid and the Group Insurance Commission? Or by a health care provider mindset that has long treated revenue growth as the system’s primary survival strategy? And will her new role as a Blue Cross of Massachusetts Board member have any impact on her policy thinking and the guidance she gives to the working group?”
The Real Test
All of this complexity makes skepticism understandable. Massachusetts doesn’t suffer from a shortage of commissions, task forces, or data. What it lacks is follow-through—particularly when reforms threaten entrenched financial interests. 
For now, the announcement of the new working group offers promise, not proof. Whether it delivers real affordability will depend less on process and far more on what happens if meaingful recommendations hit the Legislature. 
If the group simply repackages well-known analyses or avoids taking on the important cost drivers, it will fail to move the needle. If it produces a focused set of politically difficult but economically necessary recommendations—and the governor uses her political capital to insist on action—this effort could mark a turning point.

The trial for Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr., the only defendant yet to face a jury in the seemingly never-ending Mississippi welfare fraud case, began Jan. 6. During the second week, on Jan. 14, the lead defense lawyer in the case fell ill, causing U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves to pause the proceedings. 
Later, the defense team argued for a mistrial, saying it was unclear when lead attorney Scott Gilbert would be able to return to the courtroom. Reeves ruled Wednesday a mistrial was not necessary, that DiBiase’s other lawyers could handle the case moving forward, and that the existing jury could remain intact.
DiBiase is facing 13 criminal counts including conspiracy, wire fraud, theft of federal funds and money laundering within a broader alleged scheme to raid the state’s federal public assistance agency. He received roughly $3 million in federal funds from the agency through what prosecutors call  “sham contracts,” while DiBiase argues he was a lawful contractor. 
At the time Reeves paused the trial, the defense was still in the process of cross-examining former Mississippi Department of Human Services Director John Davis, who was instrumental in pushing funds to DiBiase and his family members. Auditors questioned roughly $100 million in welfare spending under Davis’ leadership.

In addition to star witness Davis, the jury has heard from a former inspector general with the welfare agency, David Barton, and two officials from the federal agencies that oversee the safety net programs DiBiase allegedly raided – the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Children and Families.
The prosecution first called Davis on Jan. 9 in its effort to build a case – using many long, sentimental text messages between Davis and DiBiase – alleging the wrestler ingratiated himself with the then-welfare director in an attempt to strike it rich off the federal public assistance program. 
The defense began questioning Davis on Jan. 12, displaying documents and social media posts to assert that DiBiase intended to carry out the services he was contracted to provide. Davis’ testimony supported many of Gilbert’s points, such as the fact that the men did not try to conceal what they were doing.
Another lawyer representing DiBiase, Eric Herschmann, alleged during his argument for a mistrial Tuesday that Gilbert’s cross-examination of Davis was so effective, the prosecution was considering the possibility of discrediting him on the stand during its redirect.
Herschmann argued that bringing a new lawyer up to speed on the case, which involves 6 million pages of records, would be impossible to do in a short period of time. He also claimed the parties have identified 100 witnesses who could be called during the trial.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/09110154/DiBiase-5.jpg,,,2026-01-21 19:57:13.320667

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Matthew Mueller)Addiction Recovery Care, or ARC, Kentucky’s largest provider of addiction treatment, has been hit by a federal lawsuit in New York, alleging it committed “massive fraud” in Medicaid and Medicare billing and is now scrambling to raise nearly $28 million for a civil settlement with the federal government.
The allegations are included in a lawsuit by Angelica Capital Trust against ARC and its owners Tim Robinson and his wife Lelia, of Louisa, claiming the company advanced ARC $8 million which ARC failed to repay as promised.
“ARC is wrongfully withholding this money because it is in desperate straits,” said the lawsuit filed Jan. 12 in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
It asks the court to freeze the funds it says ARC owes Angelica, incorporated in Delaware and based in the Bahamas. It also alleges ARC has threatened bankruptcy to avoid being forced to repay the money.
An ARC spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a reply to the lawsuit, ARC and the Robinsons ask the court not to freeze the money, saying it would “disrupt the crucial health care services ARC provides to hundreds of patients.”
It does not mention the fraud allegations or the pending $27.7 settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, as claimed in Angelica’s lawsuit.
But Angelica’s lawsuit claims that the federal fraud investigation began after certain parties in 2023 filed a federal “qui tam,” or whistleblower suit alleging fraud on the part of ARC. Such lawsuits typically are filed under seal while the government investigates.
The FBI has said as recently as this month an investigation of ARC is ongoing.
ARC, once Kentucky’s fastest growing addiction treatment company, has foundered in recent months amid reports of the FBI investigation into possible health care fraud and financial problems that have forced it to close facilities and lay off employees.
In October, ARC announced it had reached an agreement to sell the company to Ethema Health Corp. of Florida, but on Dec. 31, announced the deal had fallen through.
The potential sale was what prompted ARC to seek the $8 million from Angelica, its lawsuit claims. ARC wanted the money to improve its ability to sell the company, the lawsuit states.
So ARC entered into a contract with Angelica in which the trust firm agreed to buy from ARC about $8 million worth of tax credits ARC expected to receive from the IRS. The purpose was for ARC “to get cash quickly” to make it look better to the potential buyer. In turn, ARC would repay Angelica when it received the funds from the IRS, according to the lawsuit.
ARC received the $8 million from the IRS on Dec, 2, but ongoing efforts by Angelica to collect the money failed, and by mid-December, ARC told Angelica its deal to sell the company had failed and it was attempting to negotiate a sale with a new buyer, the lawsuit states.
On Dec, 30, ARC lawyer Jessica Burke said ARC hoped to close a deal with a new buyer by Jan. 31, and also “threatened that ARC would declare bankruptcy” if Angelica didn’t agree to a delay in repayment, according to the lawsuit.
By early January, “it was clear that ARC was playing a shell game of some sort,” the lawsuit states.
Online federal court records show a judge held a hearing Jan. 21 on Angelica’s request for a temporary injunction to bar ARC from “misappropriating” any of the trust company’s funds but do not show the judge has entered a ruling.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — A South Dakota legislative committee defeated a proposal Wednesday at the Capitol that could have produced more revenue from the state’s taxes on gold mining.
Tax revenue from gold extraction has stayed stagnant in recent years, even as gold prices increased. Sen. Mike Rohl, R-Aberdeen, proposed that the severance tax rate change from $4 per ounce of extracted gold to a half percent of the market value of the gold extracted.
The current tax was set in 1994, when the price of gold was about $400 per ounce. A separate law establishes a sliding scale up to an $8 severance tax if the price of gold reaches $800 per ounce, Rohl said, but the authors of that bill likely didn’t imagine that the price of gold would go far past that.
Gold production increases at mine in South Dakota’s Black Hills

The price of gold is now about $4,800 per ounce. With Rohl’s proposed tax, companies would effectively be paying about $24 per ounce at current prices.
“I think this is actually a pretty modest increase,” Rohl said. “It’s following the actual framed intention of the tax on severance of gold in the state.”
The current severance tax rate generated $784,000 for the state’s general fund last fiscal year, Rohl said. Another state tax of 10% on the net profits from the sale of precious metals mined in the state generated about $9.8 million, he said.
The Wharf Mine near Lead is the only active, large-scale gold mine in the state. The mine is owned by Coeur Mining, which reported selling $228 million worth of gold from the Wharf Mine in 2024.
The first million raised from Rohl’s proposed tax would be added to the state’s general fund. Beyond that, the money would be deposited into a proposed rural water infrastructure fund. Rohl said the state doesn’t have a consistent source of funding for water projects.
“It’s somewhat fitting to trade one resource that has value to the state for another resource that has value for the state,” Rohl said. “I would argue that’s water.”
Opponents of Rohl’s bill worry about disrupting a gold mine that provides jobs and contributes to local businesses and the community.
“Mining is not just a part of our community, but it’s the reason we exist,” said Robin Lucero, the city administrator of Lead. “They are our largest community partner.”
The Senate Taxation Committee voted 7-0 to reject the bill.
The committee also voted 7-0 to defeat one of what will be many property tax proposals this legislative session. Sen. John Carley, R-Piedmont, introduced a bill that would have lowered property tax mill levies to zero.
“This bill is not serious public policy,” Yvonne Taylor of the South Dakota Municipal League told the committee. “It is not worthy of your time.”

North Dakota Monitor special session coverage


The federal government has the right to rescind some of North Dakota’s award if the state doesn’t follow through with passing the policies, or changes them substantially.
A joint committee of lawmakers on Wednesday gave all four policy bills a do-pass recommendation.
One proposal, Senate Bill 2402, would allow pharmacists to prescribe some medications to patients and order some lab tests.
“The program seeks to improve health access and quality in our rural areas,” said Mike Schwab, executive vice president of the North Dakota Pharmacists Association.
Lawmakers approved an amendment brought by Sen. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, with the support of the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy and the North Dakota Board of Medicine.
The amendment requires a pharmacist to notify a patient’s primary care doctor if they prescribe medication or order lab tests.
The purpose of the amendment is to make sure that pharmacists communicate with doctors about treatment they provide, since doctors have background information about patients that pharmacists don’t, said Sandra DePountis, Executive Director of the North Dakota Board of Medicine.
“The pharmacist does not have access to your patient records, they are not doing an examination of the patient and they are not privy to that conversation that you are having as a patient with your health care provider,” DePountis said.
Gov. Armstrong urges lawmakers to stay focused on rural health care as North Dakota session opens

The amendment also puts limitations on some of the new powers it would grant to pharmacists.
For example, the bill would allow pharmacists to be able to switch patients’ drugs to a substitute expected to have a similar therapeutic effect.
Roers’ amendment specifies that pharmacists could not make those substitutions with certain categories of drugs, including antipsychotics, antidepressants, chemotherapy agents and Schedule II controlled substances like stimulants. 
Roers said the changes won’t impact the state’s funding from the federal government.
Joan Connell, a pediatrician and former pharmacist, told the committee she supports expanding patients’ access to care but has reservations about the bill.
She questioned how the state will measure the success of the program. Connell also said the proposal presents a conflict of interest to pharmacists who could gain income for prescribing medication.
Lawmakers on Wednesday also recommended the passage of House Bill 1621, which would require North Dakota students to participate in the presidential physical fitness test. 
The problem for some lawmakers is the federal government has not specified what the presidential physical fitness test will include. Lawmakers expressed concerns the original bill could be unconstitutionally vague, commits North Dakota to a program without knowing the details and may not exempt students with disabilities. 
“We’re not even sure what’s in the program yet,” said Sen. David Clemens, R-West Fargo, who unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to exempt non-public schools from the requirement. 
The dilemma was solved by a pair of amendments that authorize the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction to establish the criteria for the fitness test and create exceptions. 
The requirement would take effect prior to the 2027-28 school year if the bill passes. 
Another bill forwarded by the committee, House Bill 1622, allows the state to join a physician assistant licensure compact.
The goal of the proposal is to make it easier for physician assistants licensed in other states to work in North Dakota.
Sen. Judy Lee, R-West Fargo, said that North Dakota is already a part of several other licensure compacts, including those for nurses, counselors, flight attendants and EMS personnel.
Additionally, the committee recommended the passage of Senate Bill 2401, which would require doctors to receive one hour of education on nutrition and metabolic health as part of their continuing education.
The four bills will be considered by the full Legislature on Thursday.

On Wednesday, Auditor Mike Foley sent a 26-page letter to Bellevue Mayor Rusty Hike and the City Council of Nebraska’s third most populous city. It laid out concerns uncovered during a probe spurred by tips alleging that certain city vehicles were sold to high-ranking officials or their relatives, contrary to Bellevue’s typical process and at an apparent discount.
“This appears to have been a brazen attempt by some entitled senior city officials to enrich themselves at the expense of local taxpayers,” Foley said in a statement. “It is a slap in the face to all Bellevue residents, who deserve better.”
Bellevue has different opinion 
Bellevue officials, however, said an independent evaluation sought by the city showed no violation of city policy or improper sale of public property.
In a statement provided Wednesday by a city spokesperson, Bellevue said it was taking steps to reinforce safeguards that ensure compliance with state law and city policies governing the sale of surplus property.











It is both frustrating and disappointing when the agency purportedly tasked with ensuring government transparency acts so opaquely with the public.


– City of Bellevue statement 



But, the statement said, officials were disappointed that Foley “omitted key facts” and “presented conclusions that do not reflect the full record.”
“It is both frustrating and disappointing when the agency purportedly tasked with ensuring government transparency acts so opaquely with the public,” the statement said. “Such misrepresentation of the facts threatens to irreparably damage the reputation of the city.”
Foley’s team dug its heels deeper, replying that the Auditor’s Office “strongly disagrees with the city’s claim that its policies were not violated.” 
Findings pertaining to the questionable transactions in 2024 and 2025 were forwarded to the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, Sarpy County Attorney’s Office and Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission.

At the crux of the probe is an online auction process used by the city. Soliciting competitive bids for surplus property on a national web portal called GovDeals aims to ensure the greatest return. The payoff goes back into city coffers and can reduce taxpayer burden for other purchases.
A Bellevue City Council member said that GovDeals, reportedly used by the city for more than a decade, also is supposed to mitigate concerns about possible conflicts of interest because city employees would bid on an item the same as other interested individuals, the audit report said.
Foley alleges that in a few instances, certain officials directed a Bellevue employee who handles the auction process to remove vehicles from the auction website prematurely. He said that allowed a subsequent purchase by that official or a relative at an apparent discount. 
Said Foley: “City personnel who want to buy surplus government property should bid on it like everyone else, not manipulate the auction process for their personal benefit.”
The investigation named City Administrator James Ristow and City Finance Director Richard Severson as taking a part in what Foley alleged to be “conspicuous mishandling of public property.”
Three vehicles in question 
The property in question included a 2010 Chevrolet Tahoe SUV, a 2001 Ford F-550 truck with a dump flat bed and a 2017 Ford F-550 bucket truck. A city worker responsible for posting surplus city vehicles on the auction site reportedly told Foley’s team that he withdrew the three offerings from the online auction at the direction of Ristow and Severson. 
The vehicles in question, according to the auditor’s report, now are owned by a Ristow relative, Severson or his wife, and Willow Springs Ranch LLC, which lists Severson as its registered agent. Attempts to reach Ristow and Severson were directed to the Bellevue media spokesperson, Phil Davidson, who provided the city statement. 











I think the taxpayers are owed a full explanation. What are the consequences of the people doing this?


– Mike Foley, Nebraska state auditor



The probe showed that the vehicles had initially been listed for sale on the online auction platform but were withdrawn and placed in “inactive status” at the request of the city. Reasons provided for the withdrawals included “placed back into service” and “not selling at this time.” 
But, the report said, “the city did, in fact, sell those automobiles.” It laid out details: 
The 2010 Chevrolet Tahoe was withdrawn from auction six days after it was posted, when the high bid was $4,250. About a month later, Bellevue sold it for $5,000 to Ristow’s father. 
The auditor report said the city had set the initial minimum auction price for the Tahoe at $8,500. The auditor report also said that an average going rate for such a vehicle, according to carfax.com, was $10,809, twice the amount charged by the city.
“The city appears, therefore, to have sold this vehicle at a considerable discount to the city administrator’s father, doing so outside of the online auction platform normally used for such municipal sales,” the report said.
Bellevue, in its response, said values used by the auditor wrongly rely on comparisons to private, consumer-owned vehicles. The city says those are not equivalent to government fleet vehicles typically driven under demanding conditions and sold “as-is,” often requiring immediate repairs and maintenance.
For example, it said, the 2010 Tahoe had an issue with the oil monitor that did not allow it to be driven more than 10 miles an hour.
‘Odd’ sequence of events
In the case involving the 2001 Ford F-550 truck and flat bed, the audit said the city withdrew the truck from auction seven days after posting. At the time, more than 20 bids had been placed, the highest being $4,800. 
The auditor called it “odd” that the city sold the vehicle the next day. The new owner was listed as Severson’s Willow Springs Ranch. The city had set the minimum auction price at $7,500, the same amount Severson’s company paid for it. According to the audit letter, similar trucks were going for three times more than that sales price.
Bellevue said the flatbed “was extremely rusted,” a factor that helped determine the final sales price. 
The third vehicle in question, the 2017 Ford F-550 bucket truck, had been on the auction site for nine days, attracting 17 bids with a high offer of $18,000. 
Three days after the bucket truck was taken off the auction site, the city issued Severson a sale invoice totaling $25,000. That was about $10,000 less than the minimum auction price the city had set for the vehicle, the auditor said.
Bellevue said the bucket truck had been taken out of service due to safety issues and the turntable for the boom lift would not pass certification.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Foley’s team said auction listings were handled by longtime city employee Thomas Woodard, who bought his own surplus city car in 2024 for $1,000: a 1996 GMC Sierra C2500 pickup. Foley said the vehicle was never offered on the GovDeals website and may have been worth more. The auditor’s letter said the purchase invoice showed the transaction was approved by Ristow.
Woodard reportedly told the audit team the Sierra truck was badly rusted, the oldest in the city’s fleet and a replacement had already been acquired. 
Police captain’s ATV
In another case, a Bellevue police captain paid $1,070 for an abandoned 2022 Polaris Sportsman 450 ATV that had no title and had been in city possession for more than two years.  
Foley said that the vehicle also was held from public auction and “may have been worth considerably more.” The audit letter said Ristow approved the sale.
Bellevue said the ATV required $2,000 in repairs and still is not fully operational.
Other surplus Bellevue property, including mowers, bicycles and a boat were sold to city employees, businesses or other municipalities without being offered for auction on GovDeals, Woodard told Foley’s team, according to the audit. 
The audit team’s letter said its review “points to the apparently improper sale of the city’s personal property through the deliberate circumvention of the city’s normal surplus asset disposal process.”
Foley notes that state statute prohibits public employees from using their positions for personal financial gain beyond their lawful earnings. 
Foley said his team’s efforts to talk further with Ristow and Severson were unsuccessful. He said Severson directed them to the city attorney and that Ristow did not return the team’s phone calls. Bellevue posted its response on the city website late Wednesday. 
“I think the taxpayers are owed a full explanation,” Foley told the Examiner. “What are the consequences of the people doing this?”

It is expected to continue growing even as the state is required to make an extra effort to reduce its inmate population under the requirements of a 2018 law activated for the first time last year when the state prison vacancy rate fell below 3% for 30 consecutive days. 
Legislators on the Joint Budget Committee expressed concern that the department is not making an effort to reduce the prison population and instead is asking for more beds while the department is struggling to fully staff prisons. State Sen. Judy Amabile, a Boulder Democrat, suggested there are hundreds of people in state custody “who don’t need to be there because they’re not dangerous.”

“I understand we have people there. We need to feed them. We need to take care of them. We need to get them medical care,” Amabile said. “But until there is a plan, or plans, to address why the releases are lagging the admissions, and why that’s changed, and what we can do about that, it’s very hard for me to support more beds.”
Amabile expressed concern that the department has not sought any legislative solutions to improve its population struggles or additional funding for treatment programs that would make certain people in custody eligible for parole. Justin Brakke, a legislative budget and policy analyst, said the state “should consider legislation to either reduce admissions or increase releases or both” if it does not want to keep funding more prison beds. 










Limited prison capacity is of course a challenge for staff, but we are in the midst of a staffing crisis that’s compromising safety for our members, the incarcerated population, and the public, and adding more beds is only going to make things much worse.


– Hilary Glasgow, executive director of Colorado WINS


The Colorado Criminal Justice Reform Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy group, and Colorado WINS, the union representing state workers, urged the committee to deny an increase in prison beds. Hilary Glasgow, executive director of Colorado WINS, said the union has never opposed a request for additional prison beds and that it is “not a position we take lightly.”
“Limited prison capacity is of course a challenge for staff, but we are in the midst of a staffing crisis that’s compromising safety for our members, the incarcerated population, and the public, and adding more beds is only going to make things much worse,” Glasgow said in a statement. 
The DOC is not underfunded, rather it is underperforming, according to the coalition’s deputy director, Kyle Giddings. 
“At a time when the state is about to make deep cuts to higher education, healthcare, and many other programs Coloradans depend on, a moral budget would invest in people and communities — not in broken bureaucracies,” Giddings said in a statement. 
The coalition is supporting legislation yet to be introduced that intends to strengthen the 2018 prison population management law.  
State Rep. Kyle Brown, a Louisville Democrat, said during the committee hearing he wants an explanation from the department or the state parole board about why parole releases have dropped. He wants a more comprehensive plan from the department to better manage the prison population instead of just increasing the number of beds. 
The committee approved 50% of the department’s request for funding to pay local jails for the beds they use to house people awaiting intake to a state prison, as well as 50% of its request for medical care. The jail backlog improved after the committee approved a supplemental request for additional beds in September, but it went back up to higher levels shortly thereafter. 
State Rep. Rick Taggart, a Grand Junction Republican who voted in favor of additional beds, said he was worried that the committee’s denial of additional prison beds will put a greater burden on the county jails already struggling to house people awaiting intake to the department. State Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Weld County Republican, also voted in favor of additional beds.
The DOC will be able to ask the committee to reconsider its decision on the supplemental requests during its meeting on Monday.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A state Senate panel advanced — but did not endorse — bans on hemp-derived intoxicants and kratom on Wednesday at the Capitol in Pierre.
Both bills were sponsored by Sen. John Carley, R-Piedmont. 
The Senate Health and Human Services Committee voted unanimously to put the two prohibition bills in front of the full state Senate with no recommendation. Committees generally give a “do pass” recommendation to the bills they send out for a floor vote.
The votes came one day after the Senate Judiciary Committee offered its unqualified support for a bill meant to restrict the sale of certain hemp-based products to people older than 21. That bill came from Attorney General Marty Jackley.
Bill to ban sale of pot-like Delta-9 to minors is on path to easy passage

In testimony about Carley’s bills, business owners and consumers of products like hemp-derived THC seltzers and kratom said they helped people kick opioids or alcohol. They also mentioned sales taxes collected on consumable products and the value of hemp to South Dakota farmers. That led some committee members to oppose the bills and sparked failed attempts to block the proposals. Ultimately, however, the committee opted to let the state Senate weigh in. 
“We need to have a conversation about this on the floor,” said Sen. Curt Voight, R-Rapid City. “I think it rises to the level of a legislative decision.”
Possession, sale or use of kratom or THC consumables under each proposal would be a class 2 misdemeanor, punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
Tighter rules on hemp products
The first bill, Senate Bill 61, aims to act as an outright ban on the possession, sale or use of any intoxicating hemp products in the state outside of licensed medical marijuana dispensaries.
Such products are typically produced by altering or distilling cannabidiol, or CBD, found in the hemp plant to produce forms of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, which is the intoxicating compound found in greater abundance in the marijuana plant.
Many of the gummies, vape cartridges and other products made using hemp-derived THC variants like Delta-8, Delta-9 or Delta-10 are sold primarily in smoke shops, but THC seltzers are often available at bars, liquor stores or grocery stores.
The products essentially act as a workaround for the prohibition of marijuana in South Dakota by anyone who lacks a medical marijuana card, Carley said. The senator is also a member of the state’s Medical Marijuana Oversight Committee, which has taken testimony from medical cannabis providers about the impact the unregulated market has on their operations.
“This actually is harming the licensed marijuana businesses,” Carley said.

Carley had the support of the South Dakota Police Chiefs’ Association, South Dakota Sheriff’s Association and a group called Protecting South Dakota Kids.
Opponents included representatives for hemp retailers and hemp growers and a handful of business owners, who said the bill’s ban on any products with more than 0.4% THC by weight would remove many non-intoxicating products from store shelves, including topical creams.
“All this is a hemp and CBD ban,” said Matt Yde, who sells CBD in Sioux Falls but does not offer intoxicating products. “I would have to close my store, because I would have to remove 90% of my products.”
Steve Siegel of the South Dakota Trial Lawyers Association said he’s had many friends who’ve switched to THC seltzers from alcohol or pain killers. He said their popularity shows consumer demand, and getting a medical marijuana card can be expensive and onerous.
“These drinks should be regulated. But they’re selling like wildfire,” Siegel said. “They’re a phenomenal alternative to alcohol.”
Carley responded by saying the state shouldn’t be encouraging people to switch from one mind-altering drug to another.
He was “sorry to hear” about people who’d been addicted to painkillers and alcohol, but said instead of switching to a THC alternative, “They need some friends there. They need some church. They need some God in their life, or even ice cream or tea.”
Enforcement question
State law already bans the sale and production, but not the use, of adulterated THC derived from hemp plants. Lawmakers passed that bill in 2024.
It’s unclear how Carley’s bill criminalizing possession and use would impact enforcement.
An official opinion on the matter came at the request of the city of Brookings, which operates a municipal liquor store and inquired about the possibility of selling Delta-9 THC drinks at the store.
Attorney General Marty Jackley wrote an official opinion in November that said THC drinks containing hemp-derived Delta-9 THC may be illegal if the intoxicating compounds were created by distilling CBD oil. 
Law banning sale of some near-pot products takes effect, but won’t prevent every legal high

Without testing, the opinion says, the question of the legality of any particular hemp-derived drink “cannot be answered.”
Carley pointed to that letter in his testimony and said his bill would “help clean this up, so that both the public and the attorney general can have a better way of controlling this.”
Jackley’s office did not testify for or against Carley’s bill. 
Later Wednesday, in an emailed statement, Jackley’s office told South Dakota Searchlight that “we appreciate Sen. Carley bringing this issue to the forefront,” and that Jackley will “continue to work with all legislators on legislation that addresses age-appropriate restrictions and guardrails around these products.”
The issue of testing remains, however.
“Generally speaking questions about whether a specific product is ‘intoxicating’ or otherwise prohibited often still come down to what the product actually contains, which is typically established through reputable laboratory testing,” the statement says.
In an interview after the hearing, Carley said he understands that the products are likely being sold illegally already. Adjusting the current law’s verbiage to specify that hemp-derived THC is meant for medical marijuana users will clarify its intent for law enforcement and the business community, he said.
“This just simplifies it for everyone,” Carley said. “If you want to sell this, it needs to be in a dispensary.”
Kratom ban
As with hemp-derived THC, lawmakers in South Dakota have whittled around the regulatory edges of kratom for several years.
Lawmakers passed a bill to ban the sale of kratom to people younger than 21 in 2021. They voted to set potency limits and require safety and dosing labels, and to ban adulterated derivatives of the drug, in 2025.
Kratom products, most forms of which are legal in South Dakota, are made from the leaves of the kratom tree, which is native to Southeast Asia. Sold as powders, pills or in shot-sized drinks sometimes mixed with other ingredients, kratom products can have stimulant or intoxicating effects, depending on the dosage and plant variety used. Kratom can be found in smoke shops, but is also sold in convenience stores across South Dakota.
Kratom faces increasing scrutiny from states and the feds

It can be used to alleviate pain, anxiety or to treat opiate addiction, Carley said, but it can also be abused, lead to addiction and kill people if used improperly.
The Department of Health has tallied at least six deaths from kratom use, Carley said. Health department spokeswoman Tia Kafka told South Dakota Searchlight after the hearing that those deaths came in 2024. Lawmakers passed their latest round of kratom restrictions the following year.
Pointing to a fact sheet from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and a list of states that have banned kratom outright — including, this month, the state of California, whose health department declared its sale illegal — Carley said it’s time for South Dakota to pull the product from shelves. His bill to do that is Senate Bill 77.
“This is an emerging drug issue in the United States,” Carley said.
Michigan resident Susan Eppard testified that she’d lost a son to kratom leaf powder, not to the adulterated versions of kratom lawmakers in South Dakota have already banned.
“Kratom caused him to have a seizure, go into cardiac arrest, and die a violent death on his kitchen floor in front of his girlfriend,” Eppard said.
Matthew Lowe, executive director of the Global Kratom Coalition, said most of the issues associated with kratom use have been tied to the adulterated product. He also said that 18 clinical trials have shown natural leaf kratom to be safe, and that South Dakota’s move to regulate the products’ labeling may well be enough to mitigate any harms that might come from abuse.
“I think we need to focus on what has been passed and create a safe marketplace before we walk down the path of prohibiting natural kratom leaf entirely,” Lowe said.
Debate focuses on business impact, uncertainty 
Sen. Jamie Smith, D-Sioux Falls, supported moves to block both bills in the committee, in part based on concerns about impacts to businesses. Worries about the loss of access to CBD products was a particular concern, he said, given the Carley bill’s THC per container dosage limits.
“We’re doing something per container, and we don’t define the size of the container,” Smith said. “That’s bad legislation.”
Sen. Tim Reed, R-Brookings, meanwhile, said it may be too soon to move on kratom, given testimony about how people can use it to replace opioids or treat pain.
“I’d hate to take a product away from people who are using it responsibly,” Reed said.
Sen. Kevin Jensen, R-Canton, represented the majority on both bills, opposing moves to stop the bill in committee. Kratom specifically has become a problem drug for young people in South Dakota, he said, because “it’s so easy to get” in spite of the age limits.
The impact on business and sales tax collections from users of kratom or THC products, he argued, shouldn’t carry weight in debates on drug abuse.
“When we’re looking at public safety, I don’t want to hear about sales tax revenue,” Jensen said.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/EM8A9668-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-21 19:57:13.320667

Chris McDaniel, left, speaks with Sen. David Givens, right, earlier this month. (Kentucky LRC, Public Information)One of the leaders of the GOP-controlled Kentucky Senate has filed a bill that once again moves oversight of the Jefferson County Public Schools from the school board to the board’s superintendent. It models a similar 2022 bill the Kentucky Supreme Court struck down last year. 
Senate President Pro Tempore David Givens, R-Greensburg, told reporters after the Senate had adjourned Wednesday afternoon that while there are “no differences” between his Senate Bill 1 and the law struck down by the Kentucky Supreme Court, he’s confident this version will meet constitutional muster. 
When the state’s highest court struck down the previous law that singled out Jefferson County Public Schools, Justice Angela McCormick Bisig wrote in the majority opinion that justices were not saying “the General Assembly may never enact legislation addressed to only one particular type of county or form of county government, but rather only that it cannot do so unreasonably.”
Givens said SB 1 includes a long list of reasons why Jefferson County Public Schools should be treated differently through legislation. 
“We open with 42 reasons very specifically of why this — the largest school district in the state, impacting the largest number of students and receiving the highest level of state general fund monies of any district in the state — should be treated differently,” Givens said. “On top of the education shortfalls, we’re now seeing the fiscal shortfalls.”
Those reasons listed in the legislation include that the district operates one of the “one of the largest public-sector budgets” in the state; that the school district operates a transportation system serving tens of thousands of students that has seen “repeated transportation failures”; and that the school district has a substantial and growing budget shortfall, “driven in part by undisciplined spending practices, reliance on temporary federal funds, and delayed corrective action.” 
Jefferson County Public Schools is grappling with a $188 million shortfall in the 2026-2027 budget. The Jefferson County Board of Education voted Tuesday to accept a draft budget that implements $142 million in cuts including the closure of two elementary schools. The school district has also dealt with delayed buses for years in part because it struggled to recruit bus drivers. That longstanding issue, combined with a number of changes including newly-designed bus routes, led to disastrous results during the first day of school in 2023: some students did not get dropped off from school until 10 p.m. A U.S. Department of Justice probe found the delayed bus drop offs disproportionately impacted Black, Latino and multilingual students. The district’s spokespeople have said bus drop off times have since improved.
Neither Corrie Shull, the chair of the board of education for the school district, nor the district’s spokesperson, Caroyln Callahan, responded to an email requesting comment on the bill.

Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, also touted the filing of another education bill, Senate Bill 3, which would require school districts in the state to publish various financial reports on their websites including the employee contract for each district superintendent. The bill would also specify dates for when a superintendent would have to present a draft budget to a school board, and such a budget would have to include a reserve fund worth 2% of the district’s budget. 
“It’s really just about financial transparency, it’s about good stewardship, and it’s common sense measures that our taxpayers want to know, that their tax dollars that they work hard for are being utilized in the most responsible way to educate the students of Kentucky,” Tichenor said. 
Fayette County Public Schools, the state’s second-largest school district serving Lexington, has wrestled with a budget shortfall. Tichenor said Wednesday afternoon she’s not spoken with Fayette County schools’ leadership about her bill. The Kentucky State Auditor’s office is conducting special examinations of both Jefferson County and Fayette County school systems.
The bills’ low numbers reflect that both SB 1 and SB 3 are considered priority legislation by the Kentucky Senate. Givens expects more education-related bills to be filed as the legislative session continues.  
“Education policy is one of the biggest places that we have to operate in, and sadly enough, it’s one of the largest issues that we’ve seen shortfalls in,” Givens said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/mcdaniel-givens010626-1024x713.jpg,,,2026-01-21 19:57:13.320667

All three were suspended with pay Dec. 19 pending the outcome of Durham Public Schools’ review of the case, DPS Superintendent Anthony Lewis said in a statement Wednesday.
The case involved a 6-year-old autistic girl at Eno Valley Elementary School who is referred to as D.G.M. in court documents. The child was allegedly tied to a chair by a teaching assistant in November 2024. 
According to court documents, a Spanish-speaking custodian photographed the student tied to the chair and shared the photograph with a Spanish-speaking teacher. The teacher shared it with the school’s secretary, who slipped a copy under Principal Tounya Wright’s door.
It was unclear from court records Wednesday whether the teaching assistant accused of tying the student to a chair has been charged with a crime. 
Two teaching assistants were named in a December 2025 search warrant that allowed Durham Police to search the school district’s central office and digital records. Charges were filed against only one of them but dismissed by the Durham District Attorney’s office in November. 
The grand jury found there is enough evidence to bring criminal charges against Wright, the principal; Ayesha Hunter, senior executive director of employee relations for Durham Public Schools; and Tanya Giovanni, deputy superintendent of administration. They’re accused of obstructing the “investigation and prosecution” of the child abuse incident involving the six-year-old.
According to court documents, one or more of the individuals “knowingly provided false or misleading information statements under oath” during Durham Police Department’s investigation of the incident.  
“The evidence further demonstrates that there were significant delays and inconsistencies in the timeline for reporting the incident to law enforcement and other authorities, contrary to statutory requirements for immediate reporting of suspected child abuse,” according to the search warrant.
In his statement, the superintendent said because the case involves personnel issues and ongoing legal proceedings, there are limits on what he can share publicly.
“What I can say clearly is this: protecting students is our highest responsibility, and it guides every decision we make,” Lewis said. “Any concern involving student safety must be handled with urgency, care, and full cooperation.”
Wright was indicted on three potential charges of felony obstruction of justice and one potential charge of perjury. Meanwhile, Hunter potentially faces six charges of felony obstruction of justice and two charges of perjury. Giovanni was indicted on five counts of felony obstruction of justice.
Court records show Giovanni had a court appearance Wednesday and bond was set at $10,000. Hunter and Wright have arraignments scheduled for Feb. 5, according to court records.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Durham-Central-Offic2.jpg,,,2026-01-21 19:57:13.320667

[…]","Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger speaks at a budget hearing Wednesday at the state Capitol. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderElection season in Georgia is here, with statewide primary elections less than four months away and the campaigning for those contests well underway.
But as Georgians prepare to cast their ballots, a key question remains unclear: Will the state be able to eliminate QR codes from ballots to comply with a 2024 state election law?
During the second day of budget hearings at the state Capitol, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger appeared before lawmakers to discuss Gov. Brian Kemp’s proposed budget for his office. The hearings will continue into Thursday, with Attorney General Chris Carr and other law enforcement and public safety-related agency heads scheduled to present. 
Kemp’s budget proposal for the secretary of state’s office includes $1.8 million for optical character recognition technology that can be used to scan the human-readable text on ballots and $5 million toward a hand count verifying the outcomes of two statewide races during the 2026 cycle, Raffensperger told lawmakers Wednesday. 
“These funds strengthen election integrity, transparency and public confidence,” Raffensperger said. “We are requesting that these funds be made recurring to ensure Georgia can continue to conduct audits that verify election outcomes that reinforce voter confidence.”
However, the plan appears to fall short of  a 2024 law that prevents QR codes from being used to tabulate ballots after June 30. However, lawmakers failed to appropriate the funds necessary to make the switch before the Legislature adjourned last year. 
The use of QR codes on ballots has faced criticism from cybersecurity experts and proponents of hand-marked paper ballots, who say that ballots should be counted based on text that can be deciphered by humans.
During the 2025 legislative session, Raffensperger estimated that updating all the necessary equipment to implement that change will require roughly $66 million in state funds, more than double the $32.5 million estimate that was floated when lawmakers considered the proposal in 2023. The money would be used to fund the purchase of 33,000 new ballot printers, along with new optical scanners and updated memory cards needed to tabulate ballots with human-readable text. 
Lawmakers weigh seismic changes to Georgia’s voting equipment

Election administrators have told the Georgia Recorder that they need a minimum of six months to comfortably implement the new technology. Under that timeline, any changes to Georgia’s voting equipment would need to be finalized by mid-April.
Under Raffensperger’s proposal, ballots would continue to be tabulated using QR coded, while the hand recounts and text audits would help verify the QR codes’ accuracy. However, this plan received pushback from some Senate Republicans, who argue that it would not fulfill the requirements of the law.
“In November of this year, when our voters cast votes, what are we certifying?” said Sen. Greg Dolezal, a Cumming Republican and cosponsor of the 2024 measure. “Are we certifying a ballot that is being tabulated with a QR code or not?”
“The General Assembly has not funded a single dollar to upgrade the system,” Raffensperger replied. “If you do fund that system, then we could talk about alternatives. But it’s not been funded and it’s not reflected in the governor’s budget.”
Other election bills, including a proposal to switch Georgia’s voting system to hand-marked paper ballots and new restrictions on AI-generated election misinformation, are left pending from last year. The Senate Ethics Committee, which hears most election-related bills, is scheduled to hold its first meeting of the 2026 legislative session Thursday.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) House lawmakers voted 64-28 Wednesday to approve a bill that would block companies from using eminent domain to build carbon sequestration pipelines in Iowa.
The bill now goes to the Senate, where Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh has introduced his own bill aimed at addressing the eminent domain issue.
The House passed a similar bill last year, along with a more complex bill aimed at protecting property rights, limiting carbon sequestration pipelines and addressing issues with the Iowa Utilities Commission. Only the second bill was taken up, and ultimately passed, by the Senate before Gov. Kim Reynolds vetoed it. 
This year’s bill, House File 2104, was expedited by House Republicans who have been open in their opposition to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, which was granted a permit and the right to eminent domain by the Iowa Utilities Commission in 2024.

Opponents of the bill, including Summit Carbon Solutions, have said it will kill the project aimed at transporting carbon dioxide from biorefineries in Iowa and sequestering it underground. The Iowa corn and ethanol industries argue that without the pipeline, they are excluded from needed new markets. 
Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, led the bill and said the use of government power to seize property “for a private economic development project is not constitutional.” 
Holt argued that if the government is to take private property, they have to prove that it serves a public purpose. 
“The CO2 pipeline project, which, according to its supporters, will be a great benefit to agriculture and to our economy … but that does not make it a public use project. It is not essential for the functioning of our society, and it serves no public purpose,” Holt said. 
Rep. Chad Ingels, R-Randalia, who shared that he is a fourth-generation farmer, said a “yes” vote on the bill was “not in the best interest of the public.” 
He argued that eminent domain has been allowed in Iowa for the construction of drainage ditches, agricultural tile lines and railroads. Eminent domain requires landowners to allow easements on their property for a “just price” set by a county commission.
“Through this process, it looks like previously, private companies have utilized eminent domain for a private gain, while also improving the public good,” Ingels said.
Ingels argued that the market access the pipeline project would allow, for Iowa farmers who are in a downturned market, would be a “public good for all of Iowa.” 
“Having better markets for our products, worldwide markets for our products, is not only in my family’s best interest … It’s in the best interest of our state and the young people wanting to come back and farm,” Ingels said. “I believe with a yes vote, and if this was signed into law, it would block this project.” 
Ingels noted that since South Dakota enacted a law similar to HF 2104, the Summit project has not been able to move forward through the state. 
The carbon pipeline and eminent domain issue held up legislative proceedings last year when a group of Republican senators refused to vote on key budget items until the Senate held debate on the issue. 
Leading up to the start of session, lawmakers said they planned to prioritize the eminent domain issue and called for unity among Republican lawmakers. 
Rep. Ross Wilburn, D-Ames, said he would vote against the bill, as he felt it didn’t represent a “comprehensive” approach to the issue. 
In subcommittee and committee hearings on the bill, Wilburn asked his colleagues what had changed since the year prior when the Senate was against the bill and the governor chose to veto it.  
“Governor Reynolds, you missed an opportunity to show leadership and reach out to the minority leaders in the House and the Senate in a bipartisan way to come up with a solution to address property rights and economic development,” Wilburn said during floor debate Wednesday. 
Wilburn, along with 19 other House Democrats, voted against the bill. 
Eight lawmakers were absent or did not vote on the issue.

Rep. Brian Lohse, R-Bondurant, also opposed the bill and said it creates “two, separate regulatory schemes” depending on the contents of a pipeline, and in doing so, “violates the protection clauses of the US and Iowa constitutions.” 
“If we’re going to have regulatory schemes regulating underground pipelines, they have to be applied equally under the equal protection clauses of these constitutions,” Lohse said. 
On Tuesday, Klimesh introduced two bills related to the pipeline issue. One would allow all hazardous liquid pipeline operators to seek out willing landowners for pipeline easements, outside of their approved route, when there is an unwilling landowner in the path. The other would apply a severance tax on carbon dioxide transported by the pipeline. 
Opponents of the pipeline, and proponents of the eminent domain ban, said Klimesh’s bills did not give landowners the protections from eminent domain they feel is necessary. 
Holt, in his closing comments, argued that under current law, and with Summit Carbon Solutions’ already approved permit from the Iowa Utilities Commission property owners who don’t want the pipeline are not protected.
“Those who want the pipeline, they can sign voluntary easements, those who do not, have the constitutionally protected right to refuse — and the government has no right, in this case, to intervene,” Holt said. “The precedent we will set, if we allow private property to be seized for a private economic development project will reverberate for decades to come, and could render property rights safeguards in our constitution meaningless for our children and our children’s children.”

MONTPELIER — Vermont Gov. Phil Scott’s administration is proposing to lay off as many as 19 employees at the state Agency of Transportation in order to save money in its budget for the fiscal year starting in July.
Overall, the governor’s fiscal year 2027 budget would cut 31 transportation agency positions, though a dozen are currently vacant, Joe Flynn, the state transportation secretary, said Wednesday. The plan would save the state just over $4 million.
The secretary was giving the House and Senate transportation committees a first look at the Scott administration’s transportation-related budget proposals for the upcoming fiscal year at a joint hearing Wednesday morning. The governor did not mention the proposed layoffs during his budget address Tuesday, though officials from his administration indicated at an earlier press briefing that some layoffs were likely.

Wednesday’s proposal is notable because it comes just months after the transportation agency cut some of its staff last fall. The agency was required by law to find savings in 2025 after state economists, in July, lowered past projections for how much revenue the state would get to pay for transportation projects. Under its resulting cost-cutting plan, the agency slashed 31 total positions, in addition to delaying some planned projects.
Last year’s cuts resulted in at least five agency employees losing work, Jayna Morse, the agency’s director of administration, told the House Appropriations Committee earlier this month. About half of the positions on the chopping block were vacant, while some workers were able to get other jobs in state government, she said.
The transportation agency currently has about 1,200 employees, Flynn told legislators. 
The proposed layoffs represent the largest group of staff cuts at any one agency across Scott’s new budget plan. They would not take effect until after Scott and the Legislature enact their new fiscal year budget, a process that’s typically completed by May. 
Twenty of the latest proposed cuts would be in the agency’s maintenance division, Flynn said. Eight are in its administrative office. Two are in its division focused on highways, and one is in the division overseeing rail, airport and public transit.
The latest proposed round of cuts comes as the state continues to face major challenges paying for its transportation system.
State transportation revenues are projected to be about $33 million short of the amount needed to access as much matching federal grant funding as possible for transportation projects. In the upcoming fiscal year, if unfilled, that shortage could leave about $165 million in federal dollars on the table, according to legislative analysts. 
In his budget address, Scott proposed plugging about a third of that hole by diverting $10 million in state revenue from taxes on new vehicle purchases to the Transportation Fund. Absent that change, the $10 million would go to the state’s Education Fund.
Each year, a third of all revenue the state brings in from that “purchase and use” tax goes to schools. Scott said Tuesday that he wants to wean the Education Fund off that revenue source over the next five years. His plan drew immediate skepticism from some Legislative leaders, though, who said they worried it would create a hole in the Education Fund that would be filled by property taxpayers who are already burdened with steep bills.
Later Wednesday, Candace Elmquist, the transportation agency’s chief financial officer, told the House Transportation Committee that the state wants nearly all — about $9.3 million — of the redirected tax revenue to pave roads and repair or replace bridges. The remaining sliver would pay for tree trimming along Interstate 89, she said. 
Beyond the $10 million tax revenue shift, last year’s position cuts and the cuts laid out on Wednesday, the agency has proposed filling much of the remainder of its $33 million gap in the coming year by using an accounting mechanism that allows certain funding from the federal government to be used, effectively, as a one-to-one replacement for state revenue, Elmquist said.
The chairs of the House and Senate transportation committees said Wednesday it was too early to say whether they’d be willing to spend money in their proposed versions of a budget to keep the 19 workers in their jobs.
“We’re going to have to measure the pain,” said Sen. Richie Westman, R-Lamoille, one of the committee chairs. “And we’re going to have to judge that versus all of the (other) stuff.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Sens. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville and David Sires, R-Cedar Falls, told reporters Wednesday there is bipartisan interest in taking action to stop anonymous, corporate influence in Iowa elections.
The two senators introduced Senate Joint Resolution 2004, a proposed amendment to the state constitution saying “the people do not intend, and have never intended the powers and privileges of corporations to include participation in election activity, ballot-issue activity, or financial donations to political candidates or political committees.”
It would ban corporations from financially contributing or otherwise participating in election and ballot issue activities, with language specifying this does not stop businesses from being able to manufacture, operate or sell election equipment.

This proposal is specifically a means to combat the impacts of the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which struck down limits on how much money a corporation can directly spend in support of a political campaign.
Many critics of the decision have said Citizens United has given corporations and wealthy individuals the ability to fund elections without their identities publicized, as political action committees and candidates accept contributions from “dark money” groups — often 501(c)(4) social welfare groups or 501(c)(6) trade associations — which do not have to publicly release information about their donors.
Wahls, who is running for Iowa’s U.S. Senate seat in 2026, said in the 16 years since the Citizens United decision, “the floodgates opened, and it became easier for corporate interests and anonymous groups to spend unlimited amounts to influence our elections, often without voters even knowing who is behind it.”
He said the court decision has allowed special interests to set political agendas while the issues impacting most Iowans go unaddressed.
“This proposal is a state-based response to Citizens United and the idea that corporations should be able to spend unlimited money to influence our elections,” Wahls said. “The point is straightforward: Iowa’s democracy should belong to Iowans, not to corporate dark money and not to anonymous political spenders. I’m fighting for this because I believe the public’s business should be done in public, and because Iowans deserve a government that works for them, and when we reduce the corrupting influence of corporate money in our politics, we can create space to actually solve problems, lower costs and rebuild trust.”
Sires, a businessman and former Cedar Falls city council member, said there are many issues he and Wahls do not agree on, but that the proposed amendment was a bipartisan issue. He said polling shows “a majority of Americans in both parties want dark money out of politics,” and the amendment would address that issue in Iowa elections.
“This is a common sense issue and a conservative idea, that government should answer to citizens, not special interests,” Sires said. “Corporations receive special privileges from the state so they can operate in the marketplace, not to dominate in politics. The amendment is about Iowa’s independence and local control and making our election shaped by voters, not corporate money.”
The Iowa amendment language is similar to a proposed 2026 ballot measure in Montana, proposed by the group Transparent Election Initiative. In both proposals, corporations’ power granted through the state charter system would be limited for political campaign and candidate spending. However, states can only control the operation of corporations and businesses within their state.
“What we’re talking about here is corporations that are formed in the state of Iowa and their ability to spend those dollars on political activity,” Wahls said. “… We’re really trying to focus on corporations here in the state of Iowa, because that’s what we have jurisdiction over here in the General Assembly.”
While the proposal discussed Wednesday did not include any language encouraging Congress to overturn Citizens United at the federal level, both Wahls and Sires expressed interest in taking further action that would limit corporate influence and encourage transparency across all elections.
Sires said the measure is an important step in giving Iowans the ability to know where campaign funding is coming from.
“Democracy actually depends on informed voters, but when donors are hidden, citizens can’t evaluate who’s trying to influence them,” Sires said. “Anonymous influence allows powerful interests to shape outcomes without public accountability. … The issue isn’t just spending money, it’s spending money in secret. If you want influence an election, the public deserves to know who you are. Transparency is a small price to pay for democratic legitimacy.”
The proposal would have to gain approval in two consecutive general assemblies and then win approval from a simple majority of voters on a general election ballot before being added to the state constitution.
“It’s a lengthy process, but it needs to start somewhere,” Sires said.

A complaint, expected Jan. 22, will argue the law, which the Legislature adopted in 2024, is unconstitutional. 
The post Wyoming Board of Equalization readies lawsuit challenging residential property tax cap appeared first on WyoFile .","The State Board of Equalization will challenge a tax cap on residential property in court, arguing the Wyoming state law enacted two years ago is unconstitutional. 
The lawsuit is set to be filed Thursday, board Vice-Chairman Marty Hardsocg confirmed to WyoFile. Hardsocg declined to provide other details about the complaint. 
As part of a slate of 2024 tax bills aimed at lowering the burden for homeowners, the Wyoming Legislature created a tax exemption structured as a tax cap. More specifically, the law caps annual property tax increases at 4%, even if the real estate’s value grows at a higher rate. 
Lawmakers argued at the time that structuring the cap as an exemption would provide a way to work within the confines of the Wyoming Constitution while still providing immediate relief to taxpayers struggling with ballooning taxes from swiftly rising housing prices. The forthcoming complaint is expected to allege otherwise. 
As outlined in the Wyoming Constitution, it is the board’s responsibility “to equalize the valuation on all property in several counties and such other duties as may be prescribed by law.”
Most of the board’s time is devoted to resolving disputes between taxpayers and the Department of Revenue, and reviewing appeals from decisions of county boards of equalization that adjudicate disputes between taxpayers and their county assessors, according to its website. Members of the board are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate.

“Threats directed at Idaho judges and courts have increased significantly in recent years, and while most never materialize, those that do require precautions that can disrupt court operations and delay the delivery of justice,” Bevan told legislators. 
During the 22-minute speech, which he delivered to both the Idaho Senate and the Idaho House of Representatives, Bevan raised concerns about a Dec. 26 shooting at the Shoshone County Sheriff’s Office in Wallace, near the county courthouse and other government buildings. KBOI and other news organizations reported that a suspect began shooting outside the Shoshone County Sheriff’s Office, injuring two members of the public and a law enforcement officer. The 77-year-old suspect was killed following a standoff with law enforcement officers after the suspect entered the sheriff’s office and barricaded himself inside, KBOI reported.

“It’s only been a month since a man approached the Shoshone County Sheriff’s Office and began firing his weapon,” Bevan said. “The nearby courthouse was closed for a state holiday. But had it been open, it is unsettling to imagine county clerks, court staff, the public or judges finding themselves in harm’s way. All of us who serve in public office understand that the risk is not theoretical.”
In a separate incident, the Idaho State Judicial Branch issued a press release in September calling for an end to public threats against a judge who sentenced a defendant who was originally charged with a felony for lewd conduct with a minor child under 16 to probation after a plea agreement for a different charge was agreed upon. Following the sentencing, Idaho court officials say the judge and his family and children were subject to numerous nationwide threats including calls to hunt the judge down.
Idaho court officials said the volume and seriousness of the threats against the judge required additional security precautions at public expense. 
“Legislators, judges and executive officials alike have been reminded tragically that public service can make one a target – especially given the importance of conducting public business in a space open to the public – and that reality places sustained pressure on courthouse security,” Bevan said.
In Wednesday’s speech, Bevan noted that state funds are constrained this year, and he did not bring any specific proposals or funding requests to the Idaho Legislature. But he did ask legislators to thoughtfully consider how best to protect public officials and members of the public who use the court system.
“The state of Idaho has a legitimate interest in the security of courthouses where state employed judges conduct the public’s business,” Bevan said.

Christopher Moon shot himself as law officers arrived at the scene and contacted him by phone, according to a statement from the sheriff’s office in Bonneville County, Idaho.
“At 8:06 am Bonneville County Dispatchers received a 911 call from a man indicating he just shot his wife,” the statement reads. Christopher Moon identified himself, “indicated he had a gun and was going to take his own life,” the statement reads.
“Moments later Christopher was observed using the gun to shoot himself.” Bonneville County Sheriff’s Office
Sheriffs’ deputies from Bonneville County, Idaho, and Lincoln County Wyoming, including a SWAT team, responded to the call, said Sgt. Bryan Lovell, a spokesman for the Idaho county’s sheriff’s office. They found two vehicles parked on Jack Knife Road less than a mile west of the state border.
“Deputies established brief contact with Christopher over the phone, attempting to convince him to surrender peacefully,” the statement reads. “Moments later Christopher was observed using the gun to shoot himself.”
No other people were at the scene or involved, the department said.
Deputies from the two counties closed the area about 2.5 miles northwest of the town Etna, Wyoming, for much of the day.
Jack Knife Road, a rural lane, becomes Creamery Road where it enters Wyoming. The scene is north of the hamlet of Freedom and south of Alpine.
Witnesses posted accounts on social media describing numerous police vehicles racing to the scene, including trailers. Lovell told East Idaho News that several dozen law officers responded.

They have promised that the change wouldn’t cause much pain if the state ends $3 billion in corporate tax breaks. The policy is not a new idea for Georgia — but it’s never gone very far. One […],"Sen. Blake Tillery, a Vidalia Republican, is one of the leaders of a push to eliminate the income tax in Georgia. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderTwo high-profile Republicans running for higher office in Georgia have a pitch for voters: zero state income taxes. They have promised that the change wouldn’t cause much pain if the state ends $3 billion in corporate tax breaks.
The policy is not a new idea for Georgia — but it’s never gone very far.
One of the major reasons is that the math never adds up to many people. Another is that critics question the fairness of the policy.
Neither of those critiques has slowed state Sen. Blake Tillery, R-Vidalia, who is running for lieutenant governor and using the issue as a cornerstone of his race.
Over the summer he chaired a legislative study committee that collected testimony in favor of abolishing the state income tax.  Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, a Jackson Republican looking to move to the governor’s mansion, has endorsed the proposal.
Income taxes in Georgia — currently 5.19% — pay for about 44% of state services. Those income taxes will total about $16.1 billion in the state fiscal year beginning July 1, 2026. Georgia’s biggest outlays go to public education, health care and prisons. These costs rise every year with population.
Tillery’s committee recommended that the legislators scour the 210-page list of special tax treatments  and cut $3 billion in what it called “corporate welfare” from the list to help offset revenue lost by ending state income tax.
Some of these carveouts, however, benefit regular Georgians, as auditors note in their Tax Expenditure Report. For example, groceries are not taxed at the cash register in Georgia, something that saves all residents money but costs the state approximately $1.2 billion in lost potential revenue.
Tillery’s campaign ads that center his support for eliminating the state income tax are careful to point out that he does not propose sales taxes on groceries. He promises that he won’t raise any sales taxes and won’t cut out any special treatment for retirees or members of the military.
Tillery told The Current GA that he proposes using Georgia’s budget surplus and cash to start reducing income taxes this year in a process that would eliminate the burden over several years. Much of the proposal depends on the assumption that the state’s economy would grow and that its revenues would grow because residents would have more cash, more and more spending power; and that there are Georgians who don’t work but would change their minds and start doing so if there were no income tax. Residents from surrounding states would also be attracted to move here for tax reasons, he believes.
Tillery told The Current GA that the “cool” part of his plan is that it could be instituted now, while the hard policy debates could be delayed.  “You could actually wait until you’re in a stronger political position in year two to actually address [credits and exemptions],” he said.
While he has not published a plan or bill with specifics about how the state should make cuts, the Tax Expenditure Report offers list of what’s possible — whether it’s good, wise or popular policy is a different question.
Georgia could find $4.6 billion if it taxed the machinery, supplies and equipment that manufacturers use to make anything from toilet paper to cars. However, economists say regular Georgians would end up paying for that change through higher retail prices.
The state could also find revenue by taxing services offered by companies in the state. By and large, Georgians don’t pay sales taxes on manicures, haircuts, tattoos, legal advice, dental exams, and the like. Instituting those kinds of taxes would be a huge change that doesn’t have strong champions in the Republican-led state legislature.
Such radical change would likely rile up professional groups and their lobbyists, small business owners and every constituent who begins to understand that medical bills might be taxed.
 More valuable to the 1%

Meanwhile, some economists are already lining up to detail all the ways in which Tillery’s proposal would hurt Georgians, not help them.
Ending income taxes “is not fiscally possible without leaving most Georgians worse off economically,” said Danny Kanso, the vice president of public policy at the nonprofit Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. The think tank has opposed eliminating state income taxes for years, on the grounds that the biggest benefit would go to people with the biggest incomes.
State data shows that state income tax bills for most Georgians range from a few hundred dollars to about $8,300 each year.
The top 1% of earners, however, pay on average $33,135 or more in state income taxes.
Kanso says it’s not possible to recoup what would be lost from ending state income taxes and keep the same level of services provided by the state without raising taxes in some other way.  In places like Florida, Tennessee and Texas, which don’t levy state income taxes, residents pay higher sales taxes, for example.
 A closer look at loopholes 

Each year, the state legislature directs state auditors to evaluate a few of the state’s special tax treatments.  Auditors measure how much the tax measures cost the state, versus its benefits.
Looking at the impact of the film tax credit, for example: auditors found that 92% of film work in Georgia could be attributed to the special tax credits. If that loophole is closed, filmmakers would be very likely to leave the state for higher subsidies elsewhere, the auditors concluded.
Airlines, on the other hand, would not be expected to rush to abandon Atlanta’s massive airport if the state forced a sales tax on jet fuel, the auditors concluded. However, the amount of money that such a new tax would earn the state ‚ about $64.8 million, is a drop in the bucket for total state revenues.
Non-profit hospitals are exempt from many state taxes which add up to about $170 million a year.  But the payoff isn’t commercial, it’s community: those hospitals must provide public benefits such as charity care, community health improvements, professional education, subsidized health services, and research.

 Other Republicans, other plans

It’s unclear how far Tillery’s proposal will go during the legislative session this spring, given that there is plenty of competition for spending the state’s budget surplus.
Outgoing Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has already proposed tapping into reserves for a one-time rebate for taxpayers; and a budget that would fit in a new, smaller income tax rate of 4.99%.
House Speaker Jon Burns meanwhile has proposed cutting property taxes, not eliminating income tax.
And it is very hard to change special tax treatment, even for something as unpopular as data centers.
In 2024, legislators voted to pause special tax treatment for data centers.  Gov. Brian Kemp vetoed that.  For more than a decade, Georgia Republican leaders including Kemp have repeated that Georgia is the No. 1 state for business, citing a trade magazine ranking. Low taxes are Georgia’s selling point.

(Kate Russell for Source NM)Two days into the 30-day legislative session, public safety has emerged as a top priority for many of New Mexico’s elected officials.
Lawmakers dubbed Wednesday Public Safety Day at the Legislature. Business owners, politicians and law enforcement officials addressed a packed committee room in the Roundhouse regarding what they see as a need for tougher criminal penalties for felons who own guns and increased pre-trial detention — measures that Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, whom New Mexico Republicans labeled an “unlikely ally,” called for in her State of the State address.
In Curry County, juvenile cases referred to a probation officer increased from 307 in 2020 to 508 in 2025, Clovis Police Chief Trevor Thron said. More than 100 juvenile cases last year were felonies, he noted. He said juvenile crime strains rural departments as officers often have to leave their regular patrol routes and travel several hours to transport juvenile suspects to detention centers in Albuquerque, Doña Ana County or San Juan County.
“We’re pulling two folks off the streets to transport (someone) hundreds of miles away,” he told Source NM. “Law enforcement in general is already taxed and understaffed.”
9 medical compact bills advance in committee
A New Mexico House committee on Wednesday advanced nine bills to authorize the state to enter into health care licensure compacts after a bipartisan push to pressure Senate Democrats into approving more than two such measures this session.
Interstate compacts allow licensed professionals to practice across state lines. Lawmakers in November began drafting compacts for physicians and social workers but on Wednesday, lawmakers advanced bills for compacts that would impact:

physician’s assistants
audiologists and speech-language pathologists
physical therapists
occupational therapists
dentists and dental hygienists
emergency medical services personnel
professional counselors
psychologists
social workers

Senate Democrats have previously been reluctant to focus on more than two compacts, contending that it could overburden the state Regulation and Licensing Division. The Senate Judiciary Committee in the afternoon advanced Senate Bill 1, known as the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact Act and praised revisions to the bill after killing several compact-focused bills in 2025.
Sen. Crystal Brantley (R-Elephant Butte) at the committee meeting said she was encouraged by the House committee’s actions and was disappointed that the Senate didn’t have its own bills on licensed professionals like EMTs.
“For rural New Mexico, we need EMTs. It is very important that we adopt all of those compacts as quickly as possible,” she said.
We’re also watching…
The Senate Finance Committee discussed Senate Bill 2 Wednesday afternoon. The proposed legislation would fund New Mexico’s highway infrastructure projects with increased registration fees for passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.
A September analysis of New Mexico’s roads found they were in their worst shape in “recent history.” Legislative Finance Committee analysts at the time warned lawmakers that they expected State Road Fund revenue to slow in the coming years, due in part to electric vehicle owners who don’t need gas and therefore don’t pay gas taxes.
A recent report from the Washington, D.C.-based transportation research nonprofit TRIP found the state has $7.5 billion in unfunded transportation projects. In 2017, that figure was $1.3 billion, the report says.
The Senate Judiciary Committee also advanced a proposal, SB3, to change the definition of the phrases “harm to self” and “harm to others” in the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code and the Assisted Outpatient Treatment Act. Behavioral health advocates told lawmakers they were concerned the bill could be used to forcibly commit people to treatment they don’t want or need to receive. The committee advanced the bill with slight amendments.
Mexico-New Mexico Advocacy Day

Hugo and Lily Cortés, a Juárez-based duo, performed “Qué Bonito Es Santa Fe” outside the Roundhouse Wednesday morning as part of “Mexico-New Mexico Advocacy Day.” Lawmakers said the crowd was the largest Mexican delegation to ever visit the Roundhouse.
“We share history, we share values, we share customs, we share a commitment to making life better for every single person,” House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) said during the event. “No matter how divisive the federal administration might be right now, no matter how dark some of these times are for our communities, New Mexico will continue to stand strong in our commitment, in our ally, in our connection to our brothers and sisters south of the border.”
Looking ahead
The House Consumer and Public Affairs Committee on Thursday will discuss House Bill 9, the Immigrant Safety Act. The bill — sponsored by Reps. Eleanor Chávez (D-Albuquerque), Angelica Rubio (D-Las Cruces), Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe), Marianna Anaya (D-Albuquerque) and Sen. Joseph Cervantes (D-Las Cruces) — would ban immigrant detention in New Mexico. Cervantes last year killed a bill that would have enacted such a ban.
The New Mexico Department of Justice earlier in January said that an agreement between Torrance County and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain immigrants is “likely improper and invalid” and said Torrance County officials likely violated the state’s Open Meetings Act when they voted in December to renew their contract with ICE. 
Should such a ban pass, it’s not yet clear whether it would apply to ICE facilities with private contractors, such as CoreCivic.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/copsbykaterusselk-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-21 18:57:29.980055

Mike Hagar speaks during a legislative subcommittee meeting on Jan. 21, 2026. (Photo by Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas law enforcement officials said Wednesday 48 people have been held on immigration detainers due to state police’s participation in a federal immigration program since September. 
Lawmakers at a legislative hearing sought more details from State Police about the cost of training officers to participate in the program, with one lawmaker saying she hoped there were no barriers preventing more departments from participating.
“We should be acting as aggressively as we possibly can to make sure everybody’s trained, everybody’s participating, everybody’s on the same page to execute the president’s agenda,” said Republican Sen. Missy Irvin, who co-chairs the legislative subcommittee overseeing State Police. Arkansas State Police entered an agreement last summer with federal immigration authorities, granting it limited immigration enforcement power through the 287(g) Task Force Model program. 
The program is a “force multiplier” that allows state and local agencies to enforce limited immigration authority during routine duties, according to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement site.
Through the agreement, state police can contact ICE if it believes a person it comes into contact with during traffic stops, pursuits, investigations or other routine enforcement activity may be in the country illegally. ICE can then put an immigration detainer on that person.
Arkansas State Police entered into the agreement after a state law passed during last year’s legislative session required state police, the Department of Corrections and county sheriffs to do so. 
Arkansas National Guard requests immigration enforcement authority

President Donald Trump has made deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally one of the cornerstones of his second term. His administration has sent thousands of immigration enforcement agents into major Democrat-run cities with a stated goal of arresting and deporting immigrants with criminal convictions. 
However, those without criminal histories and U.S. citizens have found themselves caught up in the crackdown as well. Most recently, the shooting death of a woman in Minneapolis by an ICE agent sparked nationwide protests.
Neighboring Tennessee is moving to do more in the immigration crackdown as well. Republican lawmakers there recently unveiled plans for bills that would require public institutions such as public schools, vehicle registration offices and city governments to track and report immigration status.
Arkansas State Police Director Col. Mike Hagar told legislators that since the 287(g) agreement was signed, all but a handful of state police troopers have completed the required 60-hour training. 
Sen. Joshua Bryant, a Republican from Rogers, said that with the fiscal session approaching, he wanted to know if expenses related to the programs were being tracked for state police and the county jails that hold immigrants for Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
Hagar said he believed county jails were being reimbursed, but was unaware of how much they were being reimbursed. Troopers did the 60-hour training in between regular calls for service during their shifts, he said. ASP spokesperson Cindy Murphy said in an email that the 287(g) training was added to troopers’ regular training requirements, so they were not seeking reimbursement from the federal government for those costs.
“It’s not had an impact on our agency as far as operations are concerned,” Hagar told lawmakers.
Hagar said federal immigration resources in Arkansas were “very minimal,” and that most of those resources were taken up by picking up immigrants in local jails to take them to federal immigration detention.
Sen. Terry Rice, a Republican from Waldron, said that while he supported efforts to deport immigrants who have committed crimes, he was also concerned about the potential for state police to assist federal immigration authorities in detaining immigrants without criminal histories. 
“Is there anything outside of your daily work that y’all are doing currently in coordination with federal agencies, Homeland Security, ICE, as far as going out and just seeking anything more than people with criminal charges?” he asked.
The agency was not participating in any operations like the one Rice described, Hagar said.
He said troopers have been told there is a difference between an immigrant who was brought here as a child and who doesn’t have a criminal history, and an immigrant who is arrested for a crime.
“We’ve explained to them that we expect them to use good judgment and common sense discretion that they have under the law,” Hagar said. “And you know, we trust that they’re going to take that responsibility seriously.”

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThe head of Georgia’s Division of Family and Children Services faced questions from lawmakers Wednesday over the agency’s multi-million dollar deficit.
As of last month, the department faced a projected shortfall of about $85 million by the end of the fiscal year on June 30, leading to restricted services for families and terminated contracts with nonprofits since November.
DFCS serves vulnerable children and families including by investigating abuse and neglect, administering aid like food assistance and managing foster care and adoption.
John DeGarmo is the founder of an advocacy group called the Foster Care Institute and a foster parent to more than 60 children in Georgia. He also runs a Facebook page for Georgia foster and adoptive parents with nearly 8,000 members.
DeGarmo said many of those members are foster parents looking for help right now.
“They’re very, very troubled, they’re very concerned, they’re very disappointed and they’re very frustrated with the budget cuts,” he said. “They’re also very disappointed and frustrated that there’s been so much silence on it from DFCS. I had several today on the page say that they’re not getting calls for placements, they’re having a lack of transportation right now, and a lot of foster parents are very, very worried.”
Speaking at a budget hearing Wednesday, Department of Human Services Commissioner Candice Broce, who oversees DFCS, said that by cutting some provider contracts, the agency now projects a deficit of around $48 million by the end of the fiscal year.
Broce characterized the terminated contracts as wasteful.
“It’s not going to be, frankly, well received, but it is nonetheless the truth that those particular providers were either not doing what we had contracted for, or we could take the capacity in-house, or it was duplicative,” she said.
She said about four or five contracts had been canceled.
Gov. Brian Kemp’s recommended budget attempts to address the shortfall by including a $41 million increase in spending for out-of-home care for children removed from their families in the current fiscal year and $21 million for next year.
Broce said part of the reason for the shortfall comes down to difficulty accessing health care for foster children. She said the agency serves children with complex needs and has little power to control costs.
“They have pending charges. They have gang affiliation. They have a runaway risk or a history of it. They have a history of sexual exploitation,” she said of the most at-risk children in DFCS care. “They have fire-starting behaviors. They have low IQ or some combination of all of those things. And it’s well known that providers willing to serve those children have incredibly strong negotiating power – if we find one, you better believe I’m going to write a check.”
Broce said judges often call for services beyond what DFCS recommends, which also drives costs up. She gave examples including judges ordering more parental visitations than recommended, adding costs for transportation, or ordering multiple drug tests per week for parents, even in cases in which drug use is not suspected.
“Judges will, from all across the state, order DFCS to provide specific services and specific care, and usually we agree with what they order,” she said. “Sometimes we don’t. If we don’t, we need to appeal if we can. That’s very rare. Or we need to comply, because one of the consequences of non-compliance with a court order is jail for our case workers, or perhaps me. Hopefully not.”
Joel Lyon is the owner and CEO of ProFamily, a mental health agency that works with DFCS with the goal of preventing families from being separated. Lyon said he has seen the number of providers in his network shrink by about 30%. That includes clinical and paraprofessional staff as well as people who provide in-home services.
Speaking after Wednesday’s meeting, Lyon said he is “cautiously optimistic” that the shrinking in the projected deficit is a sign that families could soon be receiving the same level of services as they did before. He said he is also hopeful lawmakers will see this situation as an opportunity to improve those services.
“The families that we work with are desperately in need of help, and we would love for the Legislature to really understand how we can best help them,” he said.
State Rep. Katie Dempsey. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
But DeGarmo said he’s not encouraged by the projected deficit’s apparent shrinking because he fears the reduction will come at the expense of programs that benefit Georgia families.
State Rep. Katie Dempsey, a Rome Republican who chairs the subcommittee that oversees the DFCS budget, echoed that concern to Broce.
“If the contracts are kept terminated, we begin to see a reduction, a big reduction, there’s no doubt, (it’s a) huge challenge,” she said. “But what happens to those children and those families? And that’s the concern that’s overpowering this room right now.”
Broce is scheduled to appear before Dempsey’s subcommittee Friday.

(Photo by Getty Images)A far-reaching education bill that requires students to learn about “human embryological and fetal development,” mandates that school administrators allow law enforcement on their campuses, and prohibits schools from spending money on diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts cleared the House Student Academic Success Subcommittee by a partisan 12-5 vote.
Filed by Fort Pierce Republican Rep. Dana Trabulsy, HB 1071  has been referred to two other House panels for consideration before a full House vote. Sen. Erin Grall, a Republican from Vero Beach, has filed similar legislation in the Senate. That bill, which has yet to be heard, has been referred to three Senate committees.
The requirement that students in grade 6-12 be taught about “human embryological and fetal development” is a carry-over issue from last year that didn’t pass the Legislature. 
Anti-abortion ‘Baby Olivia’ video could become required viewing for some schoolkids

Specifically, HB 1071 would require that students be shown a one-minute ultrasound demonstrating development of fetal organs and a three-minute computer-generated video describing conception and the stages of human development. The committee tagged on a lengthy amendment that, among other things, would require the information to be medically accurate.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has fought pushes in other states to air what is known as the “Baby Olivia” video, noting in a statement to CNN last year that, “like much anti-abortion misinformation, the ‘Baby Olivia’ video is designed to manipulate the emotions of viewers rather than to share evidence-based, scientific information about embryonic and fetal development.”
Another complaint is that the videos measure pregnancy from the moment of fertilization instead of from the first day of the last menstrual period. The shift makes fetal development appear two weeks longer than it would be in a clinical setting, where health care providers measure pregnancy from the last menstrual period.
Trabulsy said the Department of Education, headed by Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas, would develop rules to determine which fetal instructional materials will be shown to Florida students. 
She encouraged legislators and members of the public attending the meeting to keep abreast of that process, noting that the department will have to publish notice of its  proposed rules.
She also promised she’d work hard to ensure the DOE didn’t choose the pre-existing “Baby Olivia” video to show students.
“I hate Baby Olivia, too. I think it’s a terrible video,” Trabulsy said. “I don’t want it. I don’t like vendor-specific, prescribed, legislation, so it’s not going to be ‘Baby Olivia’ when I get involved in the rulemaking. I just don’t like it,” she said.
But she did defend the teaching mandate.
“I don’t know what we’re scared of. We are just teaching about human development,” she said. “You know we teach how tadpoles become frogs and we teach how in a cocoon the moth becomes the butterfly but we’re not supposed to talk about how embryos become a baby.”

The “human embryological and fetal development” teaching requirement wasn’t the only provision in the bill to draw criticism.
Trabulsy amended the bill to order local school districts and charter school governing boards to to “cooperate with law enforcement campus visits, including the use of canine units.”
The amendment continues: “Such policies must prohibit a school administrator from denying law enforcement officers …  access to a district or charter school campus.” 
Law enforcement is defined as any person who is elected, appointed, or employed full time by any municipality or the state or any political subdivision thereof; who is vested with authority to bear arms and make arrests; and whose primary responsibility is the prevention and detection of crime or the enforcement of the penal, criminal, traffic, or highway laws of the state.”
That provision caught the eye of Sunrise Democratic Rep. Lisa Dunkley, who asked Trabulsy whether it would require school administrators to allow ICE officers on campus.
Trabulsy erroneously said that ICE agents aren’t allowed in schools. She said she offered the amendment because some schools aren’t allowing K-9 units on campus.
“That’s not what the intent of this amendment is. If we need to make it more clear in the future so that it gives you a comfort level I am happy to do that,” Trabulsy said.
The amended bill also would:

Ban laboratory schools from using racial or sex set-asides, preferences, or quotas in their admissions policies, requiring instead that admissions criteria emphasize merit and achievement with no regard to “race, sex, creed, color, or national origin.”
Prevent a charter school implementing a school improvement plan from dismissing a student based on academic performance.
Eliminate a requirement that school advisory councils created by the district be representative of the ethnic, racial, and economic community served by the school.
Ban public schools (including charter schools), school districts, charter school administrators, or school direct-support organizations from spending any money to  purchase membership in, or goods and services from, any organization that discriminates on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or religion.
Preclude public schools (including charter schools), school districts, charter school administrators, or school direct-support organizations to promote, support, or maintain any programs or campus activities that advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion, or promote or engage in political or social activism.

Equality Florida lobbyist Jon Harris Mauer said the prohibitions went too far.
“We’re concerned as drafted the funding provision on diversity equity and inclusion and political or social activism is far too broad. It’s unclear what problem this is solving. These activities tie education to real world problem solving, drive personal growth ,and encourage critical thinking. Having a politically and socially active community should be a goal of our education system, not something we are undermining,” he said.

The workers, who typically process applications and check for immigration fraud, have not performed ICE enforcement work before, a USCIS employee said.

At least seven U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services employees based in Vermont have been told they will be temporarily reassigned to Minnesota to help with expanding enforcement actions there, according to an employee.
The employee, who has worked at a USCIS office in Vermont for several years and is not one of the reassigned employees, spoke to VTDigger on the condition they not be named due to fear of retaliation. 
The workers, who typically process applications and check for immigration fraud, have never been sent to another state and have not previously performed the enforcement work federal immigration agents are doing in Minnesota, according to the employee.
“It’s a dangerous situation” for them, the employee said, adding that the workers’ reactions range from fears about having to work in a high-risk site to being resigned about accepting the temporary reassignment.
U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., who recently received similar reports, said she is “outraged” to hear of Vermont workers being sent out of state to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“At a time when aggressive ICE operations in Minnesota have already led to deadly force and widespread fear in our communities, I am outraged to hear that Vermont USCIS employees are being sent to Minneapolis to play ICE enforcement roles that fall far outside of their mission or their training,” Balint wrote in a statement Saturday. “These are highly skilled public servants who came to this work to help people navigate the immigration system fairly and lawfully, not to do dangerous door-to-door enforcement.”
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security “must explain why this is happening and ensure Vermont public servants are not being put in harm’s way or being compelled to carry out work they did not sign up for,” she added.
Balint’s office has received reports from USCIS employees in Vermont about other ways in which the Trump administration has been undermining and overburdening them in the past year. 
This includes holding them to performance metrics regarding the number of cases they can process, limiting by country the cases they can work on, forcing a return to overcrowded offices that in some cases involve 50 mile commutes, denying reasonable accommodations and violating their collective bargaining agreement, spokespeople from Balint’s office said.
“With the shift in mission, it has moved from demoralizing to dangerous for both applicants/legal immigrants and USCIS employees,” Catherine White, communications director at Balint’s office, said in an email.
While USCIS, ICE and Homeland Security did not address specifics, a USCIS spokesperson confirmed the agency is increasing personnel in certain areas to support ICE enforcement.
“USCIS is proud to support ICE with volunteers who have extensive expertise to help enforce our immigration laws and confront national security threats. In addition, USCIS is surging personnel to support its fraud detection efforts in hotspots across the county,” Matthew Tragesser, a national spokesman for USCIS, wrote in a Tuesday email.
Anti-ICE protests have erupted across the country, including in Vermont, since 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis this month. About 300 people protested in frigid weather outside the ICE facility in Williston on Tuesday evening.
ICE has since significantly ramped up immigration enforcement in Minnesota with more than 3,000 federal officers dispatched there as part of President Donald Trump’s promised crackdown. 
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Monday that the department had arrested “over 10,000 criminal illegal aliens” in Minneapolis, including 3,000 in the last six weeks — numbers that some experts doubt are real, The Hill reported.
Lawyers allege that detainees are being denied legal counsel there and an appeals court has suspended a decision that restricts the aggressive tactics used by ICE against protestors in Minnesota.

“We deserve a career with respect, longevity, value and fair compensation,” said Jay Peak child care manager Shannon Edmonds-Folsom.

Toddlers can enter a state of conflict every 20 minutes, Shannon Edmonds-Folsom told lawmakers Wednesday morning. It’s a symptom of their gradual development, the child care manager at Jay Peak Resort said — and it’s part of what makes caring for young children such a challenging career.
“Sounds like the Senate,” quipped Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast.
But Vermont’s youngest senators-in-the-making are seeing better care than ever, experts and child care providers told Lyons’ Senate Health and Welfare Committee Wednesday. Since Act 76 expanded the state’s child care subsidy program in 2023, the industry has added 100 programs and 1,700 care slots in Vermont, according to Aly Richards, board chair of the Let’s Grow Kids Action Network.
The main focus of the advocates who streamed into a cramped Room 17 was the state’s child care workforce. Though Richards estimated that 400 new jobs had opened up in the sector since 2023, she called recruitment difficulties “the primary constraint” for the project of bringing affordable, high-quality child care to all Vermonters.
Lawmakers were seeking input on S.206, a bill sponsored by Lyons that would create a rigorous state licensure system for child care providers, with increasing requirements for higher tiers of certification.
In practice, the measure would create a “clear and supported career path” for early childhood educators, argued Let’s Grow Kids Action Network Executive Director Emilie Tenenbaum. But along with higher standards, she said, the state must continue to strengthen scholarship and apprenticeship opportunities for Vermonters training to be child care providers.
“Better qualifications means better outcomes for kids,” she said.
Others raised concerns that the proposition might disadvantage employees who don’t go through traditional degree programs — particularly those already in the workforce. Greater Burlington YMCA’s Danielle Harris recommended the state create alternative licensure pathways that honor demonstrated competence in caring for kids.
But all parties were in agreement Wednesday that Vermont’s corps of child care professionals needs help to keep up with the growing industry.
“We deserve a career with respect, longevity, value and fair compensation,” Edmonds-Folsom said.

In the know
“So I don’t know about you, but I’m angry. I’m really, really angry,” said Sen. Becca White, D-Windsor. 
She spoke to a packed Cedar Creek room convened by activists for immigrant rights, lobbying for legislation they said would protect immigrants in Vermont as national tensions over President Trump’s immigration agenda rise. 
White had some strong words for Republican Gov. Phil Scott — and called on him to do more. 
“We have a governor who, in good times, talks about demographics and supporting immigrant communities. In good times, gives a State of the State where Afghan refugees are giving him a standing ovation for protecting them. And then remains silent when that same group of people is being targeted,” White said. 
To be sure, Scott rejected Trump’s requests to send the Vermont National Guard to Washington, D.C., and to have the troops do clerical work for ICE. Scott also later called Trump’s use of the Guard unconstitutional, though he has remained silent on other matters. 
Leah Brenner, an attorney for the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, said she’s seen people detained by federal authorities in Vermont struggle to access medical care or get in contact with attorneys because of a lack of language interpretation services. 
Her organization, along with activist organizations Migrant Justice and the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont, voiced support for two bills in the Senate that could bar civil arrests in certain locations and prevent federal immigration agents from hiding their identities when operating in Vermont. 
They also declared support for another bill, S.144, that aims to limit the scope of law enforcement making traffic stops. The bill was introduced in the Senate Judiciary Committee last year but never made it out.

On the move
The Senate approved a set of further changes Wednesday to a bill that would require disclosures on certain AI-generated media. The bill, S.23, first passed the Senate last year and then cleared the House with some changes. But the Senate never took up those revisions before the Legislature adjourned in June. 
Compared to the House’s version of the bill, the Senate version approved Wednesday would apply a disclosure requirement to AI-generated media depicting any person — not just political candidates, as the House’s version called for. (In both versions, the media would have to be published in the leadup to an election for the requirement to take effect.) The Senate also expanded the disclosure requirement to apply to issue campaigns, such as a local budget, and not just a person’s bid for office.
Another change in the Senate’s version adds language to the bill meant to make sure the text or audio of a disclosure would be visible or audible to people with disabilities.
S.23 will now head back to the House for further consideration.

A Muslim group is blasting his pardon.,"Pro-Palestinian protestors and Jewish worshipers scuffle in West Orange on Nov. 13, 2024. (Courtesy of the U.S. Department of Justice)One day after former Gov. Phil Murphy pardoned a Jewish dentist accused of assaulting a pro-Palestinian protestor outside a West Orange synagogue, the dentist says he is “profoundly grateful” to Murphy and a Muslim civil rights group is condemning the ex-governor for sending “a deeply troubling message.”
Murphy pardoned Moshe Glick, who heads a nonprofit called Israel365 Charity, on Tuesday during his final hours in office as part of a yearlong clemency initiative.
Glick, 53, had been charged by the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office with aggravated assault, bias intimidation, and weapons offenses after police accused him of bashing a Muslim protester in the head with a metal flashlight during a fracas outside Congregation Ohr Torah in November 2024. Pro-Palestinian activists were there protesting the sale of Jerusalem properties, according to a police report. The injured man got four staples to close a head wound, the report says.

Selaedin Maksut, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations of New Jersey, said Wednesday that Glick’s pardon “sends a deeply troubling message at a time when all faith communities are facing heightened threats and deserve assurance that the law will be applied fairly and consistently.”
“This is not about politics — it is about principle,” Maksut said in a statement. “Selective accountability, especially in cases touching public safety, weakens confidence in our justice system. The prosecutors were doing the right thing, and Governor Murphy stifled justice from taking its course. Our state must be clear: no one is above the law, and no community’s safety or dignity is expendable.”
The case won national attention after President Donald Trump’s administration last September sued the pro-Palestinian protesters and accused them of assaulting Jewish worshippers that night, a complaint that includes a starkly different description of the incident than how West Orange police and the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office characterized it. The lawsuit says Glick hit the alleged victim to stop him from attacking a worshiper.
“The aggressor was actively choking an elderly man. Had that assault continued, the outcome could have been catastrophic,” Glick told the New Jersey Monitor.
Glick’s attorney Michael Bachner said his client is “profoundly grateful” to Murphy and noted that Glick had not been convicted of a crime.
“The charges against Moshe were meritless. What began as an act of defending a person from violent assault outside of his synagogue has ended with the truth prevailing. This prosecution was a gross overreach, selective prosecution, and an attempt to criminalize Jewish self-defense amid rising antisemitism,” Bachner said.
A spokesman for the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office did not return a request for comment.
Essex prosecutors indicted another man, David Silberberg, on similar offenses after police accused him of pepper-spraying the same victim. Silberberg, 65, of Millburn, did not receive a pardon, and his case remains ongoing. His attorney did not respond to a request for comment.
Glick was among 148 people who Murphy pardoned or commuted the sentences of Tuesday.
West Orange has declined requests for copies of the police-worn body camera footage of the incident outside the synagogue.

Clark Center for Kentucky History in Frankfort, Kentucky, on Jan. 7, 2026.

The committee met for the first time during the 2026 session on Wednesday, largely to discuss rules for its review and accept the petitions. 
Goodwine said “the petition has no merit and should be dismissed” in a statement to the Lantern shared by her attorney. 
The impeachment petition against Goodwine stems from a case that the high court reversed to strike down a 2022 law after initially upholding it before Goodwine joined the court in 2025.

Meanwhile, Republican senators introduced a bill that mirrors the law deemed unconstitutional. Senate Bill 1, carried by Senate President Pro Tempore David Givens, R-Greensburg, would shift powers of the elected local school board to the appointed superintendent in Jefferson County Public Schools. 
Givens told reporters that the bill would “strike the balance of what (justices were) saying was not constitutional before.” 
“They found it unconstitutional because they felt like we didn’t give sufficient reason for treating Jefferson County differently,” Givens said, adding that the bill opens with 42 reasons why the state’s largest district should be treated differently than others. 
State law requires the House to review petitions for impeachment it receives from citizens. Other Kentucky officials facing an inquiry this session are Marshall County Family Court Judge Stephanie Perlow and Ballard County Jailer Eric Coppess.
An attorney for Goodwine, Carmine Iaccarino, said in a statement to the Lantern that the justice was aware of the petition. 
“Justice Goodwine takes seriously her obligations to the Court, the Rule of Law, and the People of Kentucky, as well as her personal and professional reputation, and rejects the baseless allegations in the petition,” he said. “Justice Goodwine will respond to the petition if asked to do so by the House committee, but the petition has no merit and should be dismissed.”
In a 4-3 decision last month, the Kentucky Supreme Court overturned the 2022 law, which only applied to JCPS under specific criteria. However, both sides in the case argued a decision for or against the law could impact other state policies. 
The attorney for the school board, David Tachau, argued that if the court’s original ruling stood, it could pave the way for lawmakers to widely use “special legislation,” or narrow state legislation that impacts a county or city and is prohibited under the Kentucky Constitution. Matthew Kuhn, solicitor general in the state attorney general’s office, declaring the law unconstitutional argued it could have broad implications, such as undoing the laws that allow merged city-county governments in Lexington and Louisville.
The court had ruled 4-3 in favor of the law in 2024, with former Chief Justice Laurance VanMeter voting with the majority. Goodwine replaced VanMeter on the court after he did not seek reelection. 
The latest ruling is in line with previous decisions by the Jefferson Circuit Court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which found the law unconstitutional. 
Goodwine faced criticism ahead of the court’s December decision in the case. Goodwine’s campaign for Supreme Court received support from Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and his political action committee.
In October, a Louisville attorney and GOP official, Jack Richardson, filed a petition with the clerk of the Kentucky House calling for Goodwine’s impeachment for not recusing herself from the case. According to a report from Louisville Public Media, Richardson said it was improper for Goodwine to rule on the case after an independent political action committee heavily funded by the Louisville teachers’ union backed ads to help elect her in 2024.
Impeachment committee meets
House Majority Whip Rep. Jason Nemes, R-Middletown, sent a letter to Republican House Speaker David Osborne Tuesday to recuse himself from the impeachment proceeding into Goodwine, as his campaign had accepted donations from Richardson previously.

Nemes is the chair of the House committee. Vice Chair Rep. John Blanton, R-Salyersville, will oversee in Nemes’ stead. A Lantern reporter observed Nemes exiting the meeting room while the committee remained in executive session Wednesday to continue discussions about the rules and petitions. Nemes also later had Blanton lead the vote on accepting the petition against Goodwine and making it public. 
The three petitions, as well as rules the committee adopted, would be online later Wednesday evening, Nemes said. 
Before the court’s latest ruling, Nemes wrote an op-ed for the Louisville Courier Journal saying that the court’s ruling against the law would “not only determine the future of Jefferson County’s schools but could also unravel critical local policies that benefit urban, suburban and rural communities.”
Other officials who have faced petitions calling for their impeachment in recent years include Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, but the House committee voted to dismiss them. 
In 2023, the Kentucky Senate voted to impeach a former prosecutor, Ronnie Goldy, who asked a defendant for nude images in exchange for prosecutorial favors in its first impeachment trial in more than a century. The Senate can begin an impeachment trial after the House approves charges.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily blocked an injunction Wednesday that prevented federal immigration officers from retaliating against demonstrators.
A Friday ruling by U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez had prevented the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement from detaining or tear gassing people who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest, including observing Operation Metro Surge, which is the feds’ name for the incursion of over 3,000 immigration officers and agents in the Twin Cities.
The Wednesday decision granted Homeland Security its request for an administrative stay of Friday’s preliminary injunction. Ten of the 11 judges in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, which granted the stay, were appointed by Republican presidents, including four judges appointed by President Donald Trump.
The court decisions stem from a December lawsuit filed by six plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU. The six named plaintiffs were all observing ICE last year, either in cars or on foot, when they were threatened, pepper-sprayed or arrested by federal agents, according to the lawsuit.
The Trump administration argued in a motion filed on Tuesday that the lawsuit is based on five incidents in December that plaintiffs can “only speculate may recur,” and that plaintiffs can’t establish constitutional violations. Homeland Security said that the district court’s finding of a pattern of misconduct by ICE agents was “overblown.”
Federal immigration agents are facing backlash from local leaders, businesses and residents for their behavior as raids have ramped up in Minnesota.
The killing of 37-year-old Renee Good at the hands of federal agent Jonathan Ross has galvanized the opposition to the federal operation.
In the past few weeks, federal agents have shot a second person during an arrest; arrested U.S. citizens including a barely-clothed 56-year-old Hmong man who was misidentified by officers; and deployed tear gas and other chemical irritants against observers, protestors and bystanders, including at Roosevelt High School during dismissal hours after Good was killed.
Homeland Security also argued that limiting federal officers’ ability to retaliate puts officers and the public in danger. As an example, the government argued that tailing federal agents’ vehicles — an increasingly common tactic among community patrollers looking to disrupt ICE operations — is an “inherently dangerous activity.”
Menendez, in the preliminary injunction, had declared following ICE vehicles to be a legal and protected activity that does not justify a vehicle stop or arrest by agents.
The Reformer spoke to a protester, a U.S. citizen, who was detained for hours last week after following ICE vehicles and was never charged.
Susan Tincher, one of the named plaintiffs of the December lawsuit, drove to the scene of a reported ICE raid in north Minneapolis on Dec. 9 and exited her car. According to the lawsuit, she stood on the sidewalk six feet away from the nearest officer and asked the agents on the scene if they were ICE. The officers moved towards her, ordered her to “get back,” then pulled her to the ground. Officers handcuffed Tincher while she was face-down in the snow, according to video of the event reviewed by the Reformer. 
The agents took Tincher to the Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling; shackled her legs; cut off her wedding ring, bra and boot laces; and held her in a cell for five hours before releasing her.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_637-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-21 18:57:29.980055

(Photo by Jacob Wackerhausen/Getty Images)Iowa lawmakers moved multiple bills out of subcommittee Wednesday determining residency requirements for the nursing and law programs at the University of Iowa, adding to legislation passed last session for the university’s medical school.
House Study Bill 530 would require the UI College of Nursing to ensure at least 80% of its students accepted to its nursing program are residents of Iowa and implement priority admission to Iowa residents. House Study Bill 532 would apply the same requirements to the UI College of Law, except the residency requirement and would include those who were enrolled previously in an Iowa public, private or community college.
The term “resident of Iowa” is also defined differently between the two bills, with House Study Bill 530 describing it as someone who graduated from a high school in the state. House Study Bill 532 expanded that to include people who have lived in Iowa for at least four consecutive years before the classes they’re applying to are set to begin.
Both bills would have the university include “an applicant attestation” in which applicants would identify themselves as an Iowa resident or nonresident, or someone who’s interested in working in Iowa after graduation. The UI would also need to submit annual reports on the programs with information on how many residents were accepted or not and why any applicants weren’t accepted.
Iowa Board of Regents State Relations Officer Jason Chapman had similar comments at both subcommittee meetings, saying the board is concerned about potentially limiting the number of nurses and attorneys working in Iowa through recruiting fewer out-of-state students to the programs. These rules would also create greater competition across the state between higher education institutions.
Both the nursing and law programs currently admit people based on merit, he said. During the meeting on House Study Bill 532, Chapman said the university would “likely have to lower some of the admission standards to be able to get the number of students this would require.”
“We’re concerned about what it will do for recruiting potential students to the state to fill the jobs that we have need for in the state, and the potential unintended consequences of what it will do for some of the other programs in the state as well,” Chapman said during the House Study Bill 530 meeting.
Iowans for Affordable Healthcare lobbyist Phil Jeneary was the only person during public comment in either meeting to show support for a bill, saying during the meeting on House Study Bill 530 Iowa has a health care worker shortage and the group is “certainly supportive of trying to keep as many Iowa students here as possible.”
Rep. Timi Brown-Powers, D-Waterloo, said during the House Study Bill 530 meeting she would not support the legislation for the nursing program, saying she’s worried about potentially limiting the number of young people who would otherwise move to, and hopefully stay in, Iowa.
Subcommittee chair Rep. John Wills, R-Spirit Lake, said he understood his fellow lawmaker’s concerns, but he recommended the bill move to the full Iowa House Higher Education Committee.
“As far as having people move into the state of Iowa, however, a good majority of those people that come to Iowa to go to our schools then go back to their home state,” Wills said.
Iowa judicial branch lobbyist Caitlin Jarzen expressed similar views on the legislation relating to the UI law school, with the branch registered as “undecided” on House Study Bill 532. She said those in the judicial branch would be interested in seeing additional data on how this legislation could keep graduates of the law school in Iowa, as currently they are unsure whether this bill would be successful in that aim.
Rep. Ross Wilburn, D-Ames, participated in the subcommittee on House Study Bill 532 alongside Wills, acting as subcommittee chair again, and Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison. Wilburn said during the meeting he’s unsure of the intent behind the bill.
UI College of Law Dean Todd Pettys, who said during the meeting he received a request from the Iowa Legislative Services Agency to develop a fiscal note for the legislation, told the subcommittee he believes the bill, if passed and depending on how admissions qualifications would change, could lead to the UI losing $7 million t0 $11 million in tuition revenue.
One concern Pettys shared was of the quality of applicants the UI would have to admit if the legislation was signed into law, and whether as many students would see success on the bar exam — something that could leave students without necessary credentials and an average of $90,000 in debt and hurt the UI’s reputation as a quality law educator.
About two-thirds of the roughly 330 Iowa students wishing to go to law school apply to the UI, Pettys said, around half of whom accept the UI’s offer to attend classes. Many Iowans look to leave the state for their law education, and he said he’s worried this bill could just end up redistributing Iowans between Drake University’s law school and the UI without keeping more students in the state.
Of the out-of-state students attending the UI’s college of law, Pettys said around one-fifth of them stay in the state after graduating, which he sees as “critical to meeting the growing needs of Iowa.” The legislation would most likely change these numbers, and gut enrollment at the UI, he said.
“I’d hate to see the state’s law schools taken in the wrong direction,” Pettys said. “It’s going to make it even harder to recruit the kind of talent that I think you’d likely want representing Iowans in different matters.”
Holt said he’d love to see any information Pettys could share with lawmakers, and he looks forward to receiving the fiscal note.

(Contributed photo)Bill Hill, the former superintendent of the Bristol Bay School District, is running for Alaska’s lone U.S. House seat as an independent, he said by phone on Wednesday morning.
Hill joins a race that includes incumbent Republican Rep. Nick Begich III and two Democratic challengers — pastor Matt Schultz of Anchorage and history teacher John Williams of Fairbanks. The deadline to enter the race is June 1.
Under Alaska’s election system, the top four finishers from the August primary election will advance to the November general election, where voters are allowed to rank their picks in order of preference.
“I want people to know I’m an authentic Alaskan who’s concerned about our state and our nation, and I want to stand up and I want to represent everyday Alaskans in Congress,” Hill said. “I think we need to end the idea that having a millionaire in Congress who cozies up to billionaires is right for Alaskans. People like that don’t know what our lives are like, and so we need a real Alaskan in Congress, and I’d love to represent that.”
Named as Superintendent of the Year in 2023 by the Alaska Superintendents Association, Hill is a Dena’ina Athabascan who grew up in Kokhanok on Iliamna Lake and later moved to Naknek. He worked as a public school teacher in Juneau, as a commercial fisherman and schools superintendent. 
“I guess, how I see my first self first is as an Alaskan. And I think, like many Alaskans, I’ve just had a breadth of experiences,” he said. 
In an interview with the Anchorage Daily News, Hill declined to say whether he will caucus with Republicans or Democrats if elected to the House.
That’s a key question. Most U.S. House seats in the United States have been firmly gerrymandered or polarized in favor of one party or another, leaving a relative handful that can easily switch control from election to election.
Alaska leans Republican and isn’t currently included in a widely referenced list of swing districts, but it has been shifting toward the middle in recent years, and if President Donald Trump remains unpopular among Alaska voters, that trend could accelerate. 
The House is closely divided between Republican-controlled and Democratic-controlled seats, and if Alaska becomes a swing state, its House seat would be important to control of the House.
By text message, Hill said, “I am committed to getting the best deal I can for Alaska. For that reason, I’m not going to pick a caucus ahead of time. I’m not going to give up that leverage. That’s Alaska’s leverage, and I’m going to use it.”
Asked about his specific priorities, he said he wants to “find ways to lower costs to Alaskans. I mean the price we pay at the pump or the grocery store or child care, and especially health care. I mean, if I was in Congress, I’d be voting to extend the ACA tax credits and lower the cost of premiums to Alaska.”
Campaign finance records show Hill has contributed financially to the campaigns of Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris. In 2022, he financially supported Democratic Alaska gubernatorial candidate Les Gara.
Asked about those contributions, he said, “I have a great concern with the way that billionaires impact our government, and I’m really frustrated by the lack of response from elected officials … and I want to fight that power. I want to be there to make sure that we get the government back working for the people. And I might not agree with people who are doing the fighting, but I think that’s a primary fight for the American and Alaskan people,” he said.

Kathy Rice, R-Black Hawk, speaks in the South Dakota House of Representatives on Feb. 4, 2025, at the Capitol in Pierre. (Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Legislators in South Dakota’s House Education Committee heard concerns Wednesday at the Capitol in Pierre over two bills that could change the ways high school students earn credits for graduation, but the committee advanced the bills to the full House of Representatives.
The bills would allow the substitution of a varsity sport for a physical education credit, and an agricultural class for a science elective.
Physical education credits
The first bill, introduced by Rep. Kathy Rice, R-Black Hawk, would allow students to earn a half credit of physical education for participating in varsity sports. In order to graduate, public school students must complete one-half credit of physical education.
Students from Rapid City testified in favor of the bill. Weston Howard, a student-athlete at Stevens High School, said the policy would free up a period during his school day to focus on studies. He spends hours outside of regular class time at practices and tournaments, and sometimes misses school to travel for competitions.
“I don’t see myself as just an athlete. I am a student first,” Howard said. “When I miss class time, my focus should be on catching up academically, not being required to spend even more time on physical activity I already am doing every day.”
But Joseph Graves, the state’s secretary of education, said there may be some unintended consequences that come with the bill. A major focus of physical education classes is developing lifelong skills and habits, he said.

“The truth is no sport can possibly cover the high school PE standards,” Graves told the committee.
Thirty-one states allow varsity sports to substitute for physical education, but some of those states, like Utah, require more credits for that subject.
Graves also worries about the teaching credentials of coaches. Few coaches have a specific focus in teaching physical education, and many are volunteers who work in other sectors outside of education, he said.
The bill doesn’t establish any grading scale or require that the people grading students be certified teachers, Graves said.
“That’s a pretty severe break from everything else we do,” he said. “South Dakota has a very strong standard where if you’re going to be a teacher in South Dakota, you’re going to have a certificate.”
Rob Monson, executive director of the school administrators association, urged legislators to defeat the bill and allow education leaders in the state to work together on rewriting the state’s education standards.
“We are in a precarious position when legislators start to set standards, graduation requirements,” he said. “We have a great process with the Board of Education standards.”
The committee advanced the bill on an 8-7 vote.
Science credits
Rep. Kaley Nolz, R-Mitchell, brought a bill to the committee that would allow students to substitute an agriculture class for a science elective, although the credit could not take the place of a biology course.
She said it replicates a law that allows students to replace a science credit with a computer science course.

“We’re just adding to something that we’re already doing,” Nolz said. “I’m very encouraged by the potential this legislation holds for strengthening agriculture education.”
The bill might nudge more students toward careers in agriculture, Nolz said.
The language of the bill doesn’t establish exactly what content requirements an agriculture course would have, and that’s one of the concerns Graves had with the proposal.
The legislation is “unnecessary,” he said.
The Department of Education has a process already in place that allows career and technical education courses to replace a core content course like a science, math or fine arts requirement.
The committee advanced the bill on a 12-3 vote.

(File/Spenser Heaps for the Utah News Dispatch)COLUMBIA — School district officials who oversee students’ breakfasts and lunches asked a panel of senators to hold off on changing the state’s school meal requirements until they see how federal changes work.
Senators did not take a vote on the bill Wednesday, instead deciding it needed more discussion after district officials and nutritionists warned that it could make children’s lunches harder to buy or more expensive.
The bill, which passed the House unanimously at the end of last year’s legislative session, would ban any foods containing any of a list of nearly a dozen food dyes and additives from school-provided meals and those supplied by third-party vendors. Students would still be allowed to pack a lunch containing whatever they wanted.
Suppliers sending food to schools would have to list ingredients beyond saying an item contains “artificial colors” or “natural flavors.”
The proposal follows a federal push to “make America healthy again,” which has included connecting school districts with local farmers for ingredients and, outside of schools, barring people on grocery assistance from buying certain unhealthy foods and drinks.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture in July 2024 put in place new rules that, among other changes, limited how much added sugar and sodium certain school meals can contain. The rule doesn’t take full effect until the start of the 2027-2028 school year, giving schools time to comply.
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has suggested more sweeping changes to school meals. He unveiled new dietary guidelines this month focused on whole grains, proteins and healthy fats, which could precipitate changes to lunch regulations.
School district officials and nutritionists who spoke Wednesday emphasized they supported the idea of making children’s lunches healthier. Breaking from federal regulations, however, could make food harder to get and more expensive, they said.
In Greenville County School District, the largest in the state, cooks already prepare meals from scratch using fresh fruit, vegetables and meat. Still, about 70% of the food used in students’ meals wouldn’t qualify under the bill, said Ron Jones, who oversees food and nutrition for the district.
For the most part, that would be because of the ban on umbrella terms for ingredients, he said. Jones has asked suppliers to give more specifics than saying food contains “natural flavors,” but they decline, he said.
If the district’s vendors couldn’t meet the requirements, that would leave the district scrambling to find food, potentially forcing schools to pay a premium for meals, Jones said.
Vendors would have to pay fees for violating the bill. Even if a supplier could meet the requirements, the penalties may scare them off because of the potential for human error in the process, Jones said.
“Even programs that are already leading the state and the nation in healthy, scratch-cooked, responsibly sourced meals would be forced to significantly reduce menu offerings,” Jones said.
School meal manufacturers typically work on a large scale to make sure all the food is uniform, affordable and sustainable, said Wanda McDowell, vice president of sales for Super Bakery, which supplies food for school meals.
When federal changes happen, they generally include plenty of time for suppliers to adjust, and vendors must comply. Without those incentives, suppliers are likely to drop in-state customers and look for those in other states, McDowell said.
“While well-intentioned, state-by-state requirements risk fragmenting our industry,” McDowell said.
Most of the dyes on the list, which include the outlawed Red No. 3 coloring, have natural alternatives, McDowell said. But others don’t yet. Titanium dioxide, for instance, is commonly used to whiten foods and has no known alternative, she said.
Although the dye isn’t essential for foods, it’s difficult to find suppliers who don’t use it in products like pasta sauces, and seeing undyed versions of foods might scare off children who aren’t adventurous eaters, she said.
“Kids have been taught to eat with what?” McDowell said. “Their eyes.”
If the USDA is moving in the direction of requiring healthier meals nationwide, changing the state’s rules becomes unnecessary, said Cindy Jacobs, who oversees child nutrition for Laurens County School District 56.
“Give them a chance,” Jacobs said. “Give us a change to figure out where this is going with the USDA.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/summer-meals.jpg,,,2026-01-21 18:57:29.980055

Hundreds of politicians, staffers and lobbyists attended the annual “back to session bash” Thursday, funded by tribal groups, sports betting companies and other special interests aiming to influence them. 


Assemblymember Tina McKinnor stood at the free tequila bar.
The Inglewood Democrat had asked for three glasses of Patrón El Alto, “the pinnacle of luxury” priced at roughly $150 a bottle. She kept one glass, leaving the other two for her staffers.
Her aides had been rubbing elbows with a lobbyist for AT&T and hurrying him to the bar for a drink. The lobbyist had been chit-chatting with a CalMatters reporter. But when McKinnor arrived to give him a hug and whispered in his ear, the chit-chatting stopped altogether. The lobbyist and the lawmaker know each other well: For two years, McKinnor was the author of an AT&T-sponsored bill to phase out most landlines the company is required to maintain in California. The bill died each time, but McKinnor has promised to bring it back this year.
The signature event at the beginning of each year of legislative action is one of many political extravaganzas at which lawmakers and their staff are invited to mingle with special interests. It offers a glimpse into the perks available to California politicians and shows how special interests buy access to policymakers who they hope to influence. 
McKinnor’s exchange with the lobbyist Thursday night happened in the private VIP room inside the “Back to Session Bash,” a swanky party that each year draws hundreds of California politicians, lobbyists and staffers. They puff on fine cigars, feast on free food and fancy (also free) drinks, bop to live music — sometimes even joining performers on stage — and share laughs and chatters, all on the tab of special interests, and all away from the public eye.
McKinnor’s chief of staff Terry Schanz, who was also at the party, told CalMatters her attendance “at any reception has zero impact on her policy decisions.”
“There are dozens of receptions in Sacramento every week,” he said in an email to CalMatters.

While the wining and dining doesn’t necessarily amount to a quid pro quo, it allows lobbyists to build a rapport with politicians and their staff so it’s easier to get an audience later, said Jack Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College and a former staffer in Congress and in the New York state Legislature.
“If you can be bought with a plate of shrimp, you’re not worth buying,” Pitney said.
“The rapport lubricates the deal-making,” he added. “The personal contact and relationship gives them access that isn’t easily available to somebody coming out of the cold.”
Last week’s party, hosted by the California Tribal Business Alliance, began in 2005 as a way to connect tribal leaders with policymakers, said alliance executive director Chris Lindstrom. Over the years, it evolved into one of the capital’s most popular gatherings. One first-time attendee this year remembered hearing about the bash as a place one goes to “to get messed up.” But the party in recent years has been quieter than before, especially following the resignation of three state lawmakers amid accusations of sexual harassment in the capital in 2017. 
Each year, the alliance invites all legislators and their staffers, along with constitutional officers, those who work at the governor’s administration and local elected officials who “regularly interact with tribal governments and tribal government programs,” Lindstrom told CalMatters. Attendance often exceeds 1,000, he said, with VIP access reserved for tribal leaders, state lawmakers, other officials and event sponsors. 
Lindstrom said the event promotes relationship-building and helps lawmakers understand challenges tribes face and stressed that the alliance complies with reporting requirements under state law. 
“This shared understanding supports better-informed policy decisions affecting the health, welfare, and well-being of California’s first peoples and helps avoid unintended consequences that can arise when policies are developed without early tribal consultation or engagement,” Lindstrom said.
California tribes have significant political clout and have contributed at least $23.5 million to those running for state office between 2014 and 2024. The business alliance itself has contributed $2.5 million to candidates, ballot measure committees and other committees since 2004, according to campaign finance data from the California secretary of state’s office. The alliance was one of 82 groups that fought for a controversial bill in 2024 allowing tribes to sue card rooms over claims of tribes’ exclusive rights to host certain table games. 
This year, the RSVP-only event took place at Sacramento restaurant Cafeteria 15L. It was sponsored by: 

Wilton Rancheria
Viejas Casino and Resort, run by the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians
Sycuan Casino, run by the Sycuan Band of Kumeyaay Indians
Pala Casino, run by the Pala Band of Mission Indians
Southern California Tribal Chairmen’s Association
Sports Betting Alliance
FanDuel
DraftKings 
Native-owned oil company First American Petroleum
conservation nonprofit Ducks Unlimited, and 
San Luis Rey Indian Water Authority

Many of those sponsors have had business before the Legislature in recent years. Together they have contributed a total of $130.5 million to candidates, ballot measure committees and other political committees since 2001, data shows. 
The two sports betting corporations donated the most among all sponsors, with FanDuel shelling out $35.6 million and DraftKings $34.4 million. The tribes sponsoring the event have made at least $59.1 million in political contributions in California since 2001, the data shows.

Three CalMatters reporters signed up for the event online and identified themselves as journalists to attendees they spoke to. The reporters stayed at the event from 6:40 p.m. to 9:40 p.m. While by no means a comprehensive list, these are the state lawmakers we saw at the party:

Sen. Jesse Arreguín, an Oakland Democrat, chair of the Senate Human Services Committee and Public Safety Committee and incoming chair of Senate Housing Committee
Sen. Josh Becker, a Menlo Park Democrat, chair of the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee and incoming chair of the Senate Human Services Committee
Assemblymember Tasha Boerner, a Solana Beach Democrat and chair of the Assembly Communications and Conveyance Committee
Assemblymember Sade Elhawary, a Los Angeles Democrat
Assemblymember Mike Fong, an Alhambra Democrat and chair of the Assembly Higher Education Committee
Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez, a Los Angeles Democrat and the Assembly Majority Whip
Assemblymember Ash Kalra, a San Jose Democrat and chair of the Assembly Judiciary Committee
McKinnor, chair of the Assembly Public Employment and Retirement Committee
Assemblymember Darshana Patel, a San Diego Democrat
Assemblymember Chris Rogers, a Ukiah Democrat

Last year, 22 state lawmakers each reported their attendance at the 2024 bash as a $110 gift from the alliance for food and drinks, according to a CalMatters analysis of their latest available Form 700s, which they use to report income, sponsored travels and gifts. Assemblymember Joaquin Arambula, a Fresno Democrat, reported the value at $220. Some chiefs of staff to legislators also reported being at that year’s bash.
On Thursday, the venue was packed a few minutes before 7 p.m. as more guests poured in through the main entrance, checking their winter coats to dance, some in suits and cocktail dresses. Each patron received two drink tokens to use for any drink below $15 at any of the several bars. 
But almost everything inside, including the alcohol, was already free: The espresso martinis to keep you awake; the drunken chicken and portobello mushroom tacos; the shrimp BBQ skewers, the mac and cheese and mini burgers. A bourbon tasting bar featured four options: Angel’s Envy Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, Maker’s Mark Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, Dewar’s 12-year-old blended scotch whiskey and Bulleit Rye Frontier Whiskey. 
Next to the bourbon, wafts of cigar permeated the air. Partygoers picked out roll after roll of cigars among six 50-pack boxes of various JM’s and Española’s Nicaraguan and Dominican cigars, with more unopened boxes waiting.

Deeper in the restaurant was a jam-packed concert featuring Grammy-nominated R&B singer Sisqó, most known for his “Thong Song” in 1999. Some in the front rows were into it; others in the back held up their phones to record him but then began Googling his name. 
Others preferred the quiet. Some public officials huddled outdoors while others ducked into the VIP room and patio at the end of a dimly lit hallway. Security guards stood at the door, checking for red wristbands before letting VIPs in. But as the night went on, no one seemed to be checking anymore. 
In the VIP area, two fire pits kept outdoor guests warm, and more banquet food awaited. A free tequila bar featured several Patrón tequilas as well as the Don Julio 1942, the Clase Azul Reposado, and Tequila Avion Reserva 44.
Most lawmakers spotted at the Thursday party did not return CalMatters’ requests for comment by Wednesday. 
In a statement to CalMatters, Kalra’s office said the lawmaker is not influenced by attending such events.
“For what it’s worth, he’s vegan, doesn’t smoke, and doesn’t even take campaign donations from corporations,” the statement read. 
Kalra’s campaign has reported receiving at least $69,400 from corporations such as Facebook, Google, Airbnb, AT&T, Comerica, Cox Communications and Paramount Pictures since 2016. His office did not answer questions about the contradiction between the statement and those donations by press time.
Most lawmakers had trickled out of the party by 9 p.m. But dozens of staffers and lobbyists remained on the dance floor, grooving to covers of hit songs such as APT, Juice and Finesse. Business cards were scattered on tables next to half-empty drinks. At the bourbon bar, the bottle of Angel’s Envy was gone. No one was staffing the cigar bar anymore; only cigar butts and ashes remained.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/011626-Cafeteria-15L-MG-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-21 18:57:29.980055

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Members of the LGBTQ community and their advocates spoke out in the state Capitol Wednesday against the latest assortment of proposed legislation they call “smoke bombs” — culture war measures targeting the LGBTQ community.
They contend these measures have been crafted to distract Floridians from the “failure” of Gov. Ron DeSantis and his legislative allies to address the “real crisis” facing the state — lack of affordability, a housing emergency, and skyrocketing property insurance costs.
“These distractions are intended to take our attention away from real corruption in the state Florida,” said Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, speaking specifically to a bill (SB 1010) that calls for third-degree felony charges and up to $100,000 in fines for doctors and school counselors if they advise minors to undergo transgender therapies.
“It’s another smoke bomb intended to distract from the current grand jury investigation into the $10 million he laundered for Hope Florida and stole to pay for political advertisements,” Smith added, referring to the investigation into Casey DeSantis’ Hope Florida Foundation that began last fall in Tallahassee. 
That investigation is focused on a $10 million donation the DeSantis administration steered to the foundation from a settlement between a Medicaid provider and the state over alleged overpayments. The foundation is reportedly under investigation for in turn steering money to nonprofits that then gave money to Keep Florida Clean, a political committee headed by Attorney General James Uthmeier, who was Ron DeSantis’ chief of staff at the time.
State Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando, is a candidate for Orlando mayor next year. She said that despite the “hyper politicization” of anti-LGBTQ proposals, the public is more open to that community.
“I had a meeting with Orlando conservatives at the beginning of last year, and later I sat in on a trans support group to hear what their concerns were about policy, about politics, about their communities,” she said. “And despite what you would assume are two very different groups of people, their needs were exactly the same. They want us to focus on affordability. They want us to focus on safety. They want us to focus on good jobs.”
Equality Florida, the state’s leading LGBTQ advocacy group, organized the press conference in Tallahassee, and invited parents of transgendered children to speak. Stratton Pollitzer, the group’s executive director, said SB 1010 goes “much further” than legislation passed in 2023 banning doctors from providing gender-affirming care to patients under 18 years of age.
“This would include councilors and therapists,” he said. “We know that these children have special needs. We heard that from a parent today, who talked about the crippling depression his son faced until they got a good therapist. This creates a scenario where you won’t be able to find a therapist willing to talk to your family at all because they’re afraid of a $100,000 lawsuit.”
‘Sad and angry’
Juan Dominguez said that he and his ex-wife didn’t know why their son Kai was “sad and angry at the world” and neither did the doctors and psychologists who examined him, until they met a doctor in Miami who ultimately concluded that he had gender dysphoria and was potentially transgender. Dominguez says the challenge right now as a family is getting Kai gender-confirming medication, since the 2023 law prohibits physicians from treating minors.
“The state is becoming very challenging to live in if you have a transgender family,” he said, adding that when Kai becomes an adult, he will make a decision about potentially gender-affirming or sexual reassignment surgery. “That’s not to say that he’s going to do it anyways — transgender people don’t necessarily go in the path of surgery right away.”
Among the other bills LGBTQ advocates are opposing this session are HB 347/SB 426, labeled the “Adoption and Display of of Flags by Government Entities” but what Equality Florida is calling simply the “Ban Gay Pride Flag” measure. It would prohibit governmental entities from displaying, placing, or causing to be placed certain flags on real property.
“This is literally the fourth year in a row that they have tried to do this bill, and every single year, we the people have defeated it,” said Smith.
Other bills on Equality Florida’s radar this session include:
HB 641/SB 1642, “Gender Identity Employment Practices,” which Equality Florida labels the “Don’t Say Gay or Trans at Work” bill.
It would enact regulations on pronoun use in public and certain private workplaces. It would shield employees from accountability for anti-trans harassment via intentional misgendering, and prohibit inclusion of a transgender or nonbinary gender option on any job application or related employment form. The bill also would prohibit LGBTQ-related cultural competency training requirements for government workers.
HB 1001/SB 1134 “Official Actions of Local Governments.”
This bill would stop cities and counties from funding, promoting, or taking official action as it relates to diversity, equity, and inclusion; prohibit counties and municipalities from expending funds for diversity, equity, and inclusion offices or officers; and says that county commissioners, city council members, or any other county or municipal official acting in official capacity who violates certain provisions “commits misfeasance or malfeasance in office.”
Equality Florida contends that the bill would effectively ban local governments from a range of actions like hosting or supporting Pride events, offering LGBTQ+ cultural competency training, or recognizing contributions of Black civil rights leaders during Black History Month.
Most Americans support anti-discrimination protections for transgender people, according to a Pew Research Center survey from a year ago. But that poll also found the public favors GOP-backed policies barring gender transitions for minors and compelling trans athletes to play on teams that match their sex assigned at birth.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/0-3-1024x771.jpeg,,,2026-01-21 18:57:29.980055
,DC,2026-01-21 22:50:02+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,ACLU says pregnant immigrant in medical distress deported through Atlanta airport,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/aclu-says-pregnant-immigrant-medical-distress-deported-through-atlanta-airport,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials placed an asylum seeker who is eight months pregnant on a deportation flight Wednesday afternoon, even though she was in medical distress, her attorneys told States Newsroom.ICE officials and the Department of Homeland Security responded to States Newsroom's requests for comment, but did not answer questions about the specific case. Zharick Daniela Buitrago Ortiz, a 21-year-old national of Colombia, has a pending asylum case, said one of her attorneys, Nora Ahmed, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana. Buitrago Ortiz was also represented by the Robert & Ethel Kennedy Human Rights Center. As an asylum seeker, she was going through the credible fear process, a key step to establish an immigrant’s claim for asylum if they can show a fear of persecution or torture in their home country. Asylum seekers are typically allowed to live in the United States while their case proceeds.Buitrago Ortiz is between 32 and 33 weeks pregnant and was deported from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Airport officials did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment. Ahmed said flying late in pregnancy can have serious risks. Buitrago Ortiz earlier had been detained in a center in Louisiana. She was placed by ICE on a flight from there to Atlanta prior to her removal to Colombia, her attorneys said.As she waited for the flight to Colombia, Buitrago Ortiz experienced intense, shooting pain in her back and abdomen, according to her attorneys. They said they were also concerned about the risk to her health and that of her unborn child if she was placed on the flight, which is roughly five hours nonstop. ICE generally has a policy to not detain immigrants who are pregnant unless there are exceptional circumstances. Democrats in Congress have raised concerns about reports of ICE detainment of pregnant immigrants, and urged ICE acting Director Todd Lyons to order the release of any immigrants who were pregnant from ICE detention facilities. Travel during pregnancy can be risky past 28 weeks and can increase the chances of going into labor, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Ahmed said as recently as Jan. 18, there had been no indication that Buitrago Ortiz would be removed from the United States. Ahmed said Buitrago Ortiz came to the U.S. with her family. Her mother received a favorable credible fear interview, meaning an immigration official believed there was a possibility of harm if she returned to her home country. The family arrived in El Paso, Texas, in early November, according to Buitrago Ortiz’s mother, who asked not to be named for fear of harming her own asylum case.Additionally, Ahmed said the father of Buitrago Ortiz’s child was murdered earlier this month in Colombia. “It’s important that we understand that there is a woman in medical distress,” Ahmed said. “The clock is ticking.”",,,,2026-01-21 17:56:42.909784

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)An Iowa Senate subcommittee advanced a bill Wednesday banning materials and instruction related to gender identity and sexual orientation for Iowa 7th through 12th grade students as a similar ban on these subjects for K-6 students is being challenged in court.
Senate File 2003 proposes expanding a portion of Senate File 496, the 2023 Iowa law that bans programs, materials and instruction related to gender identity and sexual orientation for K-6 students. The bill applies to public school districts, charter schools and innovation zone schools. The 2023 law also prohibited books that contain depictions of sexual acts from being available in K-12 school libraries.
Several advocates spoke in support of the measure, saying that issues regarding gender and sexuality should only be discussed with parental consent and oversight. Anita Fischer with the group “Protect My Innocence” said expanding the measure is needed because older students are often the people questioning aspects of their identity like gender and sexuality.

“Especially as the parent of a junior in high school, I hear firsthand about the social contagion of confused sexuality among teens just entering high school,” Fischer said. “What we are seeing, of particular interest, is that it’s freshmen, ages 13 to 15, who are struggling the most. It is worth noting that these are students who are exposed to the very content this bill seeks to address … before legislation had passed (restricting gender and sexuality instruction and materials) for kindergarten through sixth grade.”
Bethany Snyder and her daughter Evelynn Snyder Maul spoke in opposition to the bill, saying it would prevent Evenlynn, a freshman at Valley High School in West Des Moines, from speaking at school about her parents, a queer woman and transgender man.
Snyder told lawmakers silence on LGBTQ subjects in schools does not protect children, but isolates them.
“High school should prepare students for the real world,” Snyder said. “In the real world, LGBTQ people exist, as parents, co-workers, legislators, historical figures and leaders, and families like mine and families like hers. … Our family exists, and no law will change that. You get to decide whether Iowa schools respond to students with honesty and care, or fear and silence. But either way, our family will continue to exist.”
There are multiple lawsuits challenging the 2023 law. One filed by the publisher Penguin Random House and several authors, including Jodi Picoult, John Green and Laurie Halse Anderson alongside the Iowa State Education Association, focuses on the provisions banning certain books from school libraries. Another lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal, challenges the provisions of the law restricting access to books as well as class materials related to gender and sexuality.
The ACLU and Lambda Legal case argues Iowa students’ First and 14th Amendment rights to free speech, free association, equal protection and due process are violated by the law, and that these provisions lead to higher safety risks and discrimination against LGBTQ students.
There is currently an injunction in place on parts of the 2023 law, granted by a federal district court in May 2025. Several advocates told lawmakers the ongoing litigation shows there are major constitutional questions about the restrictions on younger students — and that the restrictions would face even more risk of running afoul of constitutional rights if applied to older students.
Damian Thompson with Iowa Safe Schools said older students have “stronger, well-established constitutional rights” that would be violated if this bill became law.
“High school students can vote soon, they can serve in the military, and they’re expected to understand complex social and health issues as they enter adulthood,” Thompson said. “Federal courts have been consistently clear that students do not shed their First Amendment rights when they enter a public school. As students get older, the state’s authority to broadly restrict access to information becomes more limited, not more expansive.”
Thompson said the proposal would also add new difficulties for schools working to meet curriculum requirements — specifically in regard to requirements on teaching human growth and development.
“Every person has a sexual orientation and a gender identity, whether or not we acknowledge it,” Thompson said. “Iowa law requires instruction in human growth and development, including instruction regarding human sexuality, in grades seven through 12. We cannot meaningfully teach the subject while pretending that these two things don’t exist.”
Danny Carroll with the Family Leader said issues regarding gender have become a “distraction” in public schools.
“Iowans have grown a little bit weary of the distraction — and sometimes very loud and profane distraction — that gender theory has brought on,” Carroll said. “And I think they’re inclined to think, perhaps, we should return our school to some of the fundamentals of learning and put this aside. I can see no way that this would interfere with teaching goodwill, friendship, respect for each other that has always been a part of our public school experience.”
The measure advanced out of subcommittee with Sens. Jesse Green, R-Boone, and Sandy Salmon, R-Janesville, supporting the measure. Democratic Sen. Molly Donahue did not support the measure.
Donahue said she agreed with Carroll calling this issue a “distraction.”
“Iowans are definitely tired of this type of legislation, and we’re seeing that with the voting records, not just in Iowa but across the United States,” Donahue said. “We should be focused on prioritizing public schools, funding, affordability for our people in this state, and making sure that we’re balancing a budget in this state that is currently over $1 billion dollars in deficit.”
Salmon said she supports the measure because there are reasons why a family may not want their children to learn about issues regarding gender and sexuality in K-12 schools.
“Just as not all parents want others to teach their children about sex education, because it involves family religious beliefs about sexuality, so (do) not all parents want others to teach children about sexual orientation and gender identity, because it too involves family religious beliefs about sexuality and sexual ethics,” Salmon said.
The measure moves to the Senate Education Committee for further consideration.

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Capital-Star)U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promoted his often controversial efforts to reform American health before a receptive, partisan crowd in the state Capitol Rotunda Wednesday. 
Piggybacking off of President Donald Trump’s popular slogan, he frequently refers to it as his “Make America Healthy Again” plan.
On a national level, Kennedy has rolled back vaccine recommendations against the broader scientific consensus and promoted work requirements for food assistance programs, though many advocates worry that the added red tape will worsen the nation’s hunger crisis. 
“The Take Back Your Health tour is about telling the truth and recognizing the extraordinary leadership of legislatures who are driving MAHA state by state,” said Kennedy. “It’s all about accountability, and it’s about putting families — especially children — back at the center of American health care.”
A chart from Peterson-KFF’s Health System Tracker comparing health spending in the United States against peer countries.
Kennedy compared the United States with Europe a few times in his speech, noting spending and health disparities between the wealthy regions. 
“Americans pay two-to-three times what Europeans pay, or our peer nations pay, for health care, and yet we have the worst results and the worst outcomes in the developed world,” he said. 
Many European countries with lower spending and better health outcomes have universal health systems or take socialized approaches where government sponsors and funds coverage. Whereas Americans primarily get their health care insurance through their employers — Trump’s budget priority bill over the summer cut funding for government programs like Medicaid.
Government control gives those countries more control over health care spending, and some may refuse to pay higher prices for certain drugs — including semaglutides used for weight loss like Ozempic or Wegovy. A dose of each in 2023 might cost an American $936 or $1,349, respectively, compared to $103 and $328 in Germany, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker.
Securing voluntary agreements from drug companies to lower prices has been a cornerstone of Trump’s health care plan, which would match costs to the “most favored nation.” Kennedy noted that these efforts had been paired with threatened tariffs to push for higher drug prices in Europe.

“We already suffer the highest chronic disease burden on Earth and our children are getting sicker by the day,” Kennedy continued. “It’s the result of decades of bad policy choices that have transformed America’s once exemplary health care system into a sick care system driven by perverse incentives that reward every participant — doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies — with more money for keeping us sick, than they can make from getting us better or preventing disease.”
The United States has higher rates of chronic illness such as diabetes, hypertension or asthma compared to its wealthy peers, as detailed by the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker. The country also leads in obesity, which can be a risk factor for other illnesses. The underlying causes for obesity are still being studied, though stress, food insecurity and lack of time or access to leisure and recreation play a role. 
Kennedy claimed that “most” chronic diseases were “diet preventable or diet induced,” touting his recently introduced food pyramid. 
“We’re telling Americans it’s time to start eating real food,” he said. “They’re getting processed food now. They’re not going to do that anymore; they’re going to get real food, and it’s going to drive changes in the marketplace.” 
 Pa. lawmakers tout MAHA priorities

State Rep. David Rowe (R-Union), who emceed the event, said the legislature sought “commonsense, bipartisan solutions to make healthier food more accessible and health care more affordable.” 
As proof, he pointed to the Healthy PA package introduced by Rep. Natalie Mihalek (R-Allegheny) last spring.
The eight-bill effort had Democratic sponsors for some proposals. Measures included food additive disclosures and labeling, prohibiting products with certain food dyes, a state definition for ultraprocessed foods, banning certain commercial pesticides and incentivizing cover crops.
Just one has advanced through a committee: a resolution to declare August as Wellness Month in the commonwealth.

Some of those ideas have had a better reception in other states, which have moved to ban synthetic dyes and reform nutrition standards to align with the MAHA agenda — part of a nationwide effort to curry favor and gain funding from Kennedy’s agency. 
Rep. Robert Leadbeter (R-Columbia), a cosponsor of one Healthy PA proposal, pointed specifically to House Bill 1131, which would have banned several artificial food dyes from public schools. 
“As a father, I thought of my children and the role that food plays in their development every single day. The role that it plays in their ability to learn and their long-term health … what our children eat matters,” said Leadbeter. 
He invoked the process of hatching an egg as a homeschooled child, which “is not a passive task,” but rather involves extraordinary, daily effort. 
“We must keep at this task every single day. We must keep doing the work even when the results are not immediately visible,” said Leadbeter. “In time, as we have already begun to see thanks to Sec. Kennedy’s strong leadership, we will hatch the future of America’s health and we will eat real food.”
 Visit panned by critics

Despite that bipartisan approach legislatively, several Democrats pushed back against Kennedy’s “campaign of misinformation,” specifically citing his opposition to vaccines. 
“Vaccines are among the most thoroughly studied medical interventions in history. The scientific consensus is clear: Routine childhood immunizations are safe, effective and essential to preventing serious and sometimes deadly diseases,” said Rep. Dan Frankel (D-Allegheny), who chairs the chamber’s health committee. 
“When figures such as Kennedy undermine that consensus, vaccination rates fall – and preventable illnesses come roaring back. The harm from this kind of rhetoric is real and measurable.”
The United States is at risk of losing its status for “eradicating” measles, a highly contagious virus with recent outbreaks in several states as vaccine uptake rates fall. States like Pennsylvania have established their own guidelines in response to Kennedy’s efforts.
Others criticized state Treasurer Stacy Garrity, a Republican candidate for governor, for appearing alongside Kennedy.

“Secretary Kennedy came to Pennsylvania because he wants to bring Washington’s chaos and division to the commonwealth, and Stacy Garrity is campaigning with him because that is exactly what she plans to do as governor,” said Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman Eugene DePasquale in a statement. 
Garrity, who has the endorsement of her party but must win the primary vote in May, is unopposed so far. She’s challenging Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is running for reelection. On Twitter, Shapiro criticized the visit, summarizing the “damage” of Kennedy in his last year, targeting his stance on vaccines. 
“As he visits Pennsylvania today, he should know: we will stand up to his attempts to sow chaos and endanger public health every step of the way,” Shapiro wrote.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2183-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-21 17:56:42.909784

Vermont health care regulators have issued a warning, but won’t intervene, as new leaders at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital work to control a projected $14.5 million annual budget shortfall.
“We want Brattleboro to thrive,” Owen Foster, chair of the state’s Green Mountain Care Board, said during a pair of review hearings that ended Wednesday. “The solution to make sure that happens is the management needs to identify the essential services for that community and it needs to come up with a plan to pay for them. It is not on the board and it is not on ratepayers to do that.”
Regulators, having questioned the accuracy of the hospital’s past financial reports, had ordered the 500-employee, 61-bed facility — the main health care provider for about 55,000 people in southeastern Vermont — to recalculate its current budget or risk becoming the first to receive state intervention under a new law.

At the end of hearings Wednesday, the state board declined to call for an independent observer to step in, noting the hospital had replaced its chief executive and financial officers with acting co-CEOs and budget consultants who are searching for savings and new long-term leaders.
Regulators stressed it wasn’t their role to bail out failing facilities and warned Vermont’s 13 other nonprofit hospitals not to follow Brattleboro’s recent example.
“We’re going to have solvency issues at our hospitals,” Foster said. “If a hospital submits inaccurate and incomplete data, I don’t know that we should be giving rate increases at all. It’s just a bad precedent to set.”
The Brattleboro hospital has reported a string of annual losses since 2021 and entered a state review hearing this past August with fears of another shortfall. But the institution nonetheless unveiled a proposed 2026 fiscal year budget at the summer hearing that estimated $121 million in spending and a $244,529 surplus as of next Sept. 30.
In response, the state expressed fears the hospital “has not accurately or completely answered many questions” and “may be at risk of a sudden solvency crisis,” regulators wrote in an Oct. 1 decision.
Shortly after, the hospital announced CEO Christopher Dougherty was taking an unexplained leave of absence in October before he exited permanently without comment in November. A month later, CFO Laura Bruno departed in a similar manner.
The hospital — one of Brattleboro’s three largest employers — is now headed by two acting co-CEOs: orthopaedic surgeon Elizabeth McLarney and primary care physician Tony Blofson.
“We acknowledge that it’s very serious to have a $14.5 billion deficit,” Blofson said at Wednesday’s hearing. “The goal is to keep the doors open for high-quality and local health care.”
Past and present administrators have blamed the hospital’s fiscal problems on everything from too many unpaid patient bills to their own staff’s rising health insurance costs, spurring them to launch a hiring freeze and let go of several managers.
Interim financial leader David Sanville, a former executive at hospitals in Berlin, Randolph and Windsor, used this month’s hearings to outline an updated $130 million annual budget and current and coming efforts to reduce expenses and raise revenue.
In response, regulators and reviewers have categorized Brattleboro’s new numbers as “an accurate representation.”
“I deeply appreciate your honesty and frankness,” health care advocate Eric Schultheis told Sanville at the hearings. “It’s quite refreshing.”

Ned Lamont proposes CT rent cap for out-of-state landlords,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/21/ct-rent-cap-out-of-state-landlords-ned-lamont/,Lamont's idea to limit rent increases by out-of-state landlords quickly drew opposition from GOP lawmakers and landlords.,"Gov. Ned Lamont on Wednesday said he will propose legislation in the upcoming session to limit rent increases for out-of-state landlords who purchase apartments in Connecticut, an idea that immediately drew opposition from some Republican lawmakers.
Lamont, speaking at a Partnership for Strong Communities event, also criticized President Donald J. Trump’s approach to housing affordability and accused 169Strong, a local group that has argued against zoning reform, of being “really, really unhelpful” by spreading misinformation on housing issues.
“As I try and talk about housing, I also try … to make sure that I’m talking about the most vulnerable in the state,” Lamont said. “I need to get people on board with an aggressive housing agenda.”
In November, the governor signed a wide-reaching piece of legislation that mandates that towns create plans that show how they’ll allow for a set number of units of housing. The law also expands fair rent commissions, offers help to the homeless population, and eliminates parking minimums for some smaller residential developments.
Lamont, who is running for a third term, negotiated the law with town leaders after he vetoed a bill the legislature passed during the 2025 regular session. He later called a special session to pass a bill he said would give towns more control, although the new bill faced heavy criticism from Republicans.
The governor acknowledged that some advocates may be frustrated with him after the veto, but said he hopes the new law helps.
“I want them [towns] to take the lead,” Lamont said. “I don’t want them just to say no. I want them to say yes.”
The governor spoke at an event focused on a new report from the Partnership for Strong Communities about the large number of Connecticut residents who pay too much of their income to rent and the lack of housing choice in the state.
Lamont’s proposal would limit how much out-of-state landlords who buy property in Connecticut can increase rents. He said he wants to keep people in their homes. Many people have faced eviction after the apartment complexes where they live are sold and the new landlord raises rent.
“It’s related to out-of-state buyers, buying up the market, using that monopoly to jack up rents,” Lamont said Wednesday. “I’ve seen that result in homelessness. A lot of seniors who can’t afford it. They get very little notice. They’re pushed out the door. We’re not gonna let that happen.”
Mixed reaction
The proposal, a limited rent cap, will likely face fierce opposition from Republicans in the General Assembly. And bills intended to cap rents have not fared well in the past. 
In 2023, a broad measure to broadly limit annual rent increases failed to get a vote before the Housing Committee. And in 2025, a bill to offer more protections to mobile and manufactured home residents that included rent caps also failed.
Also last year, the state Department of Housing pushed for a bill that would have required that local fair rent commissions consider any rent increase greater than 10% unfair if the apartment had been sold recently and no major renovations were done. The bill didn’t pass.
Landlords have said rent cap proposals limit their ability to renovate and take care of their property while earning the profit they want. 
The Connecticut Apartment Association issued a statement Wednesday saying they oppose any rent control measures.
“Rather than improving the availability of much-needed housing, rent control laws carry the unintended consequences of reducing housing supply and residential mobility, and causing higher rents in uncontrolled units, and reduced quality in controlled units,” said Jessica Doll, executive director of the association, in a statement. 
But tenants say rent increases are sometimes unfair, which pushes them out of their housing.
“For the one-third of Connecticut residents who rent our homes, it’s no exaggeration to say that hearing the governor speak in favor of rent stabilization feels like a light going on in a dark room,” said Luke Melonakos, vice president of the Connecticut Tenants Union. “Half of us are already paying more than we can sustainably afford in rent. A quarter of us are rationing food, medicine, and other basic needs. Speculative investors are running unchecked in our communities, forcing long-term residents out of their homes and tearing at our social fabric.” 
Housing Committee co-chair Sen. Martha Marx, D-New London, said she doesn’t think the governor’s proposal goes far enough. She added that she’s interested in seeing further expansion in the number of fair rent commissions, which are local bodies that have the power to hold hearings to determine whether rent increases are fair. They can order the rent to be lowered.
“We need bold legislation in order to fix the housing crisis that we’re in, and it certainly will help, but it’s not going to make that big of a difference,” Marx said, of the governor’s plan.
Republican leadership for the Housing Committee said they’d be opposed to any rent cap, no matter how limited in scope.
“It’s a very slippery slope,” said committee ranking member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe. He said bills often get expanded. “Once you theoretically let them go and just take a step, they’re going to take five steps the next year.”
Ranking member Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, said the idea would send the wrong message and discourage landlords from investing in Connecticut.
“This is a terrible idea. It will not result in lower rents for anyone. What it will do is discourage the people in the marketplace who are trying to survive from engaging in economic activity,” Sampson said.
Lamont criticizes president, local group
Lamont also criticized Trump’s speech Tuesday on affordability, which he said didn’t clearly enough lay out his plan for housing.
Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order to ban large investors from buying “single-family homes that could otherwise be purchased by families.” He’s also proposed ways to cut interest rates and allow people to use their retirement savings for down payments on homes.
“He’s talking about taking money away,” Lamont said. “You can take money out of your 401K, and use that to overpay for housing. If you’re a senior, rob your retirement.”
However, Trump’s first year back in office was largely focused on immigration and foreign policy rather than housing.
Lamont also joked about the problems that he said a local group called 169Strong has caused. The group galvanized people to call the governor’s office to urge him to veto the first housing bill the legislature passed last year.
Lawmakers and housing advocates have said the group participates in misinformation campaigns.
“There’s a group called 169 that just studied fiction in college. They just are making stuff up. It’s just really, really unhelpful,” Lamont said.
The group in a statement said it is proud of the information it deliver to residents. It also criticized the new housing law passed during the special session, which it said contained many of the same problems as the first bill.
“Our thorough analysis of HB 5002 played a key role in highlighting critical concerns — contributing significantly to Governor Lamont’s decision to veto the bill,” the statement said. “Residents and municipal leaders are wide awake and watching, and what is not ‘fictional’ is the sentiment of the voters of Connecticut who collectively sent thousands of letters to the governor on this issue.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9194-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-21 17:56:42.909784

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)A Wisconsin Assembly committee held a hearing Wednesday on a pair of bills to help mitigate and clean up water contamination caused by PFAS — a class of compounds also known as “forever chemicals” that has been tied to cancer and developmental diseases in children. 
For two and a half years, $125 million set aside in the state’s 2023-25 biennial budget to fund the cleanup of PFAS contamination has sat untouched as the Republican-controlled Legislature, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and a collection of interest groups were unable to reach agreement on how to structure the program and who should be held responsible for the pollution. 
After initial optimism, the first legislative effort died after Democrats and environmental groups complained that the proposal let polluters off the hook. 
While the debate in Madison has dragged on, communities including French Island near La Crosse, the town of Stella near Rhinelander, Wausau and Marinette have continued to face the harms of PFAS-contaminated water. 
When the legislation was introduced again at the beginning of this legislative session, legislators again expressed hope that a compromise could be reached. Earlier this week, the bill’s authors, Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) and Rep. Jeff Mursau (R-Crivitz), released a proposed amendment to the legislation. One of the bills directs how the money in the trust fund will be directed and the other creates the programs through which the money will flow.
At the hearing Wednesday, the duo emphasized how important it was for them to get the money out the door into affected communities and the need for compromise on the issue. 
“The 2023-2025 budget included $125 million to address PFAS contamination and support cleanup efforts across the state,” Mursau said. “Unfortunately, those funds are sitting idle because we have failed to pass the legislation necessary to put them to work. Progress will require compromise. There are stakeholders on both sides of the aisle who may not like these amendments, but that is the reality of divided government, and it is not an excuse for inaction.” 
The pair said the latest version of the legislation is the result of months of negotiations with the Department of Natural Resources and the Evers administration. 
While the legislation still includes the “innocent landowner” provisions that have been at the heart of the dispute, the amended version tightens the definition of who qualifies. Wimberger said the new definition would still allow the DNR to bring enforcement actions against industries including paper companies and airports, but that the current version represents a lot of movement from the DNR and Evers.
“There was quite a bit of coming off the ledge on the governor’s side regarding innocent landowners,” Wimberger said. 
Additionally, the bill creates a number of programs to test for PFAS and fund mitigation efforts by helping individual landowners dig new wells, helping communities upgrade water treatment systems and funding more comprehensive testing efforts. 
But the language of the proposed amendments shows how difficult it has been for legislators to adjust the dial on Wisconsin’s PFAS policy. The bills now have the support of Evers, the DNR and some of the state’s leading environmental organizations, but industry groups including the state’s largest business lobby, Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, and the Wisconsin Paper Council argued at the hearing that the bill would single out certain types of industry for enforcement actions. 
“Substitute Amendment One takes a huge step backwards in terms of protecting truly innocent landowners and passive receivers,” Adam Jordahl, WMC’s director of environmental and energy policy, said, referring to a particular provision of the bill.
WMC in recent years brought and lost a lawsuit that would have prevented the state’s spills law from being applied to entities responsible for PFAS pollution. 
Several industry representatives also threatened that if the amended bills are signed into law, they could invite legal challenges because of “constitutional concerns.” Jordahl said that one of the bills treats municipal facilities such as landfills and water treatment plants differently than private businesses conducting similar activities, which could make the law vulnerable to a lawsuit. 
“This discrimination raises a significant constitutional concern under the concept of equal protection,” he said. “A successful lawsuit raising an equal protection claim could result in the invalidation of those unfairly applied exemptions. Second, as a policy matter, we feel this simply makes no sense. What is the policy justification for treating commercial and industrial or manufacturing facilities differently when they’re conducting the same activities and operating under the same laws and regulations?” 
Paper industry representatives said at the hearing it’s unfair for the bill to single them out because the industry will be subjected to increased scrutiny despite their claims that the business does not cause most PFAS pollution.
Last year, the DNR named a paper mill as the responsible party for the PFAS contamination in Stella, which has seen some of the highest concentrations of the chemicals in the state.
Despite the skepticism from the business community about the latest version of the legislation, lawmakers throughout the Capitol appeared confident that it could finally get across the finish line. 
“I met with Republican lawmakers and the DNR last week about critical PFAS bill changes that will be necessary to garner my support, and I’m really optimistic we’re finally going to be able to get something good done here after months of successful and productive negotiations,” Evers said in a statement. “I’m grateful Republican lawmakers have formally introduced an amendment that reflects the changes we’ve agreed to so far as a sign of good faith. We still have some important details to iron out to make sure DNR has the resources they need, but we’ve made a lot of progress. So, I’m really hopeful.”
Both Evers and Wimberger noted that the only remaining sticking point in the negotiations is how many staff members the DNR will be authorized to hire to support the responsibilities required under the bill. The current version of the amendment authorizes 10 positions while Evers is requesting 13. 
Republican leaders in the Legislature have also signaled that the bill is likely to move forward. 
“I think it’s a move in the right direction,” Senate Majority Leader Devin Lemahieu (R-Oostburg) said. “I think it’s a bill that hopefully our caucus can get behind and maybe finally get that money out the door.”

The bill adds “foreign national,” as defined in federal law, to an existing state list of prohibited sources that includes state and local governments, foreign governments and the federal government. It also increases penalties. Under the draft, accepting a contribution from any of the listed entities would be moved to a more severe class of misdemeanor, and a subsequent offense within a calendar year would change from a misdemeanor to a felony.

The bill was introduced to the Senate State Affairs Committee by Attorney General Marty Jackley, a Republican candidate for the U.S. House. No opponents testified.
Asked how enforcement would work, Jackley said cases would likely come to the Attorney General’s Office through referrals from the secretary of state or complaints from political opponents reviewing campaign reports.
Jackley said prosecution would require proof the candidate or committee acted “knowingly and intentionally,” saying accidental acceptance would not be prosecutable.
The bill includes an emergency clause, which would make it effective immediately upon passage through both legislative chambers and the governor’s signature, and before the primary election in June. For that, it will require a two-thirds vote in the Senate and House.
Jackley told the committee that the change aligns state law with federal restrictions and a March 2025 presidential executive order that he said helps address foreign-national influence. A section of that order calls on the U.S. attorney general to prioritize the enforcement of laws preventing “foreign nationals from contributing or donating in United States elections.”

(Photo by Mary Ann Chastain / Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolinians who wear glasses or contact lenses will have to continue getting fitted for a new prescription at a professional’s office.
The state Supreme Court ruled unanimously Wednesday that a ban of online vision tests does not violate the state constitution.
The court’s ruling closed out a nearly decade-old lawsuit filed by Visibly, a Chicago-based telehealth company, formerly known as Opternative, which uses software that conducts vision tests over a person’s computer or smartphone so patients don’t have to make an in-person visit to an optometrist or ophthalmologist.
When using Visibly, the patient stands 10 feet away from a computer screen and verbally answers the questions posed by the vision test. Visibly then sends the recorded test to a licensed optometrist or ophthalmologist in the user’s state for review. A patient, age 18 to 55, had to previously have a lens prescription to be able to take the test.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared technology that’s in use in 35 states. But not in South Carolina.
Visibly provided its virtual vision test in the state from 2014 until 2016, when a law backed by the SC Optometric Physicians Association took effect and essentially banned the practice. Eye doctors can use the technology, but patients must still come into the office after the test for another eye exam, defeating the purpose of the service.
The Gov. Nikki Haley vetoed the law but the General Assembly overrode her objection in May 2016.
Visibly sued five months later, asking the courts to overturn the law as unconstitutional.
The courts disagreed, siding with the defense that legislators passed the law to “protect the public from receiving inadequate eye care,” Judge Kristi Curtis wrote in Jully 2024. Then a Circuit Court judge, Curtis now sits on the state Court of Appeals.
Lawyers for the company argued the only thing the law protects are the profits earned by optometrists when they sell glasses to patients at their office.
“If you’re not coming in, they’re losing that opportunity to make a sales pitch,” Visibly attorney Joshua Windham told the SC Daily Gazette.
“That’s what these companies always say in court,” said Kevin Campbell, chairman of the state optometrists organization.
Campbell, who practices at clinics in Hilton Head and Bluffton, celebrated the ruling.
“We know an in-person exam is the safest and most comprehensive form of care,” he said.
The state Supreme Court upheld the lower-court decision.
In the opinion, authored by Justice John Few, the court cited testimony from a pair of eye specialists — an optometrist and a neuro-ophthalmologist — who said requiring annual, comprehensive, in-office eye exams to renew a prescription is one way doctors can catch diseases, such as glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration and irritation caused by overwearing contact lenses, as well as diabetes, hypertension and autoimmune disorders.
While the optometrist group in the state pushed for the law, the state ophthalmologists organization did not share the same concern, said Dr. Kurt Heitman. Young, healthy patients with glasses don’t need to come into the office every year, he said.
“If the technology is accurate, it’s actually beneficial because it’s less expensive and increases access to care,” said Heitman, who practices in Greenville. “This is the new age we’re in. Technology is taking over and making things more accessible. If it increases access to care, how could you be against it unless you’re just trying to protect you’re revenue source.”
Lawyers for the company also argued the law treats eye specialists differently from other types of doctors who can prescribe nearly any other treatment, including eye drops, over a telemedicine call. The only explicit exceptions in state law are opioids, medication abortions, glasses and contact lenses.
“Glasses are not like opioids and abortion,” Windham, the Visibly attorney, told the SC Daily Gazette.
Few, in his opinion, drew the distinction that other forms of telemedicine involve photos and live video calls where physicians visually diagnose a patient’s condition.
“This approach still involves a direct evaluation of the patient’s physical symptoms. In contrast, prescribing corrective lenses based solely on a patient’s responses to an automated eye chart —without the eye doctor ever visually examining the patient’s eyes — is fundamentally different,” he wrote.
Windham blasted the ruling as “an abdication of the court’s duty.” He said the law was “tailor made to destroy one company just to protect an out-dated business model from competition” and “the South Carolina Supreme Court just blessed that.”
“It’s a naked abuse of governmental power,” Windham said.
The justices did give a nod suggesting the Legislature should give the law another look as telemedicine has become more commonplace.
“In light of the speed in which artificial intelligence and other technology continues to develop, we are confident the General Assembly will continue to monitor the policy rationale behind the Eye Care Consumer Protection Law,” Few wrote at the end of his opinion.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SCSupremeCourt-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-21 17:56:42.909784

The halt to wolf reintroductions after the release of just 25 individual animals — nearly half of which have already died — represents the biggest victory to date for livestock groups that have waged a five-year battle to subvert Colorado voters’ narrow approval in 2020 of Proposition 114, which mandated gray wolf reintroduction in the name of restoring ecological balance.

Colorado’s restoration plan, approved by CPW commissioners in 2022, called for an initial target population of 50 wolves, to be achieved by annual releases of 10 to 15 relocated wolves for the program’s first three to five years. The first release occurred in December 2023. The state was authorized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to manage an “experimental” wolf population under section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act.
Since Proposition 114’s passage, repeated attempts by livestock groups to delay or pause the restoration plan were rejected by CPW commissioners, state lawmakers and the courts. But in September 2025, opponents — including far-right former U.S. Rep. Greg Lopez, now running as an independent candidate for governor — appealed to the Trump administration to step in, asking the USFWS to issue a “cease-and-desist order halting further translocation of wolves into Colorado for a period of 12 months.”
A month later, USFWS Director Brian Nesvik moved to block Colorado’s plan to import wolves from Canada this winter, ordering CPW to halt any efforts to source wolves from outside a specified area in the northern Rockies, including Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and eastern portions of Washington and Oregon. Nesvik wrote in a letter that importing Canadian wolves was “violative” of Colorado’s 10(j) permit.
In fact, the permit, issued in 2023, identifies northern Rockies wolves only as a “preferred” donor population, and does not contain any requirement or limitation on relocation operations. Although environmental groups called the position taken by the USFWS “baseless,” and Gov. Jared Polis wrote that state officials “disagree with the legal basis for that analysis,” the state has opted to comply with the Trump administration’s order, and no legal challenges have been filed against it.
The administration further escalated its threats against the state’s wolf reintroduction program last month, when Nesvik warned CPW that the USFWS could revoke the state’s 10(j) permit altogether, returning control of the population to the federal government.
Earlier this week, CPW confirmed that another gray wolf, known as wolf 2504, had died in northwest Colorado, bringing the total number of reintroduced wolves that have been killed in the state to 11. The mortality rate for Colorado’s wolves is significantly higher than in previous reintroduction efforts in the northern Rockies.
The state’s remaining wolves have formed four breeding packs, and an unknown number of wolf pups were born in 2025. In a statement, Eric Odell, the agency’s wolf program manager, said that it was “not possible to predict the impact” of halting reintroductions this winter.
“When populations are small, the contributions of each individual is especially significant,” Odell said. “If mortality remains high, as observed in 2025, the risk of failing to achieve a self-sustaining wolf population in Colorado increases, potentially requiring additional resources to address.”

The announcement did not say which candidates it would be supporting. Historically, EMILY’s List has backed state Supreme Court Justice Christine Donohue, who won retention last November, state Sens. Maria Collett (D-Montgomery), Lindsey Williams (D-Allegheny) and Katie Muth (D-Montgomery), and state House Rep. Mandy Steele (D-Allegheny).
The group said it will be targeting races to elect governors, attorneys general, secretaries of state, legislatures, and supreme court justices in “key states.”
The announcement follows a tough 2024 election season for state-level Democrats, who lost ground in state legislatures across the country. 
Democrats, however, were able to maintain their slim majority in the state House in 2024, despite Republicans outperforming them at the top of the ballot. GOP candidates won every row office election in the commonwealth that year.
But, EMILYs List says they are hoping to build on liberal electoral victories in 2025, including in Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races. In Pennsylvania, liberal Supreme Court justices fared well in retention races and a democrat pulled off an upset win in a special election for a state Senate seat in Lancaster County

Since its introduction this month, S.220 has faced skepticism from groups representing school leaders and school boards during testimony in the Senate Finance Committee.

Gov. Phil Scott during his budget address on Tuesday threw support behind legislation sponsored by Senate Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, that would cap school district spending in future years.
Scott’s endorsement of the bill, proposed by the Senate’s top Democrat, came as he urged lawmakers and the state’s 119 school districts to pull “in the same direction to lower the tax burden on Vermonters this year.”
The legislation, S.220, would limit growth in school districts’ per-student spending in fiscal years 2028 and 2029. The cap would be tied to a district’s per-student spending in the 2027 fiscal year, which is the 2026-27 school year.

Following Scott’s budget address, Baruth told reporters that he “greatly enjoyed the fact that he supported my bill” but noted the legislation is still “subject to change” in the Senate Finance Committee.
“The committee will work its will, but it’s always good to know the governor is receptive, should we get it to his desk,” Baruth said.
The push to cap spending comes amid heightened anxiety over the rising cost of public education in Vermont and its effect on property taxes. To address that, lawmakers this session hope to move forward with the groundwork laid in Act 73, the state’s education reform law passed last session that would consolidate school districts and shift to a new education finance model by 2028.
Scott in his address Tuesday said he wants to use $105 million to dampen an expected 12% average property tax increase. That spike is driven in part by a projected $115 million increase in education spending next year, although districts are still formulating their budgets.
The other half of the spike is the result of a fiscal hole left by Scott and legislators’ decision to use about $100 million to blunt property taxes in 2025.
Scott in December originally queued up $75 million in excess state revenue to buy down the education tax rate but said during his budget address that he planned on using an additional $30 million legislators had set aside last year.
The buydown, he said, would cut the state’s projected tax increase by about half, from about 12% to about 5.5%.
Scott chided school districts during his address, and said that districts “upped their spending” after the state last year used general fund dollars to buy down the increase in education spending.
“We need administrators and school boards to dig deep and get creative to reduce this year’s growth in spending. And, I’ll be honest, I’m worried about what I’m seeing in the news, and what we saw last year when we made a similar investment,” Scott said Tuesday. “This money is to ease the burden on taxpayers, not to create space for school budgets to continue to grow.”
Baruth’s legislation would likely save taxpayers money if enacted. Julia Richter, a principal fiscal analyst with the Legislative Joint Fiscal Office, told lawmakers that if the bill was implemented in fiscal year 2027 — the budget year starting July 1 — the state would save an estimated $67 million, based on preliminary local school budget data.
Whether the bill would hold up to a legal challenge is another question. John Gray, a legislative attorney, told the Senate Finance Committee that the bill raised “potential constitutional concerns.” He said it could potentially be challenged under the state constitution’s educational clause, or the Brigham decision, a landmark Vermont Supreme Court decision that required the state to ensure an equal educational opportunity for all students.
Baruth’s bill is currently in the Senate Finance Committee. The committee’s chair, Sen. Ann Cummings, D-Washington, told reporters on Tuesday she would “work to get that bill out” but was cautious about the legislation’s prospects.
“I think given the fact that things like health care and employee contracts frequently cover a number of years, and nobody controls health care at this point, there is concern about the impact,” she said.
House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, said in a statement Wednesday that she continues to be concerned about introducing a spending cap when current law already has school spending penalties in place.
“It’s important to note that the excess spending threshold we have in place was developed after a tremendous amount of testimony when we were first weighing a cap versus a spending threshold,” she said, referencing existing law that double-taxes districts that spend above a certain amount per student. 
Since its introduction earlier this month, a number of organizational leaders in testimony have thrown cold water on the legislation’s viability. Many pointed to previous spending cap proposals that have been proposed and either scrapped or eventually repealed. 
Senate Republicans proposed a similar concept as an amendment to the bill that became Act 73 last session, but that was voted down, according to Senate Minority Leader Scott Beck, R-Caledonia. 
Jeff Fannon, the Vermont National Education Association’s executive director, said during testimony last week that the spending cap “should be rejected.”
Others, like Jay Nichols, the executive director of the Vermont Principals’ Association, and Elizabeth Jennings, the president of the Vermont Association of School Business Officials, said that a spending cap would do little to address cost drivers that are out of districts’ control.
Instead, the cap would force district officials to cut educational programming or reduce staffing.
“How do hard caps on education spending help with increased health care and other costs that local school boards have no control over?” Nichols said during testimony last week.

(Leah Romero for Source NM)Twenty-five billion pounds of CO2 every year, twice the yearly CO2 gas emissions of New Mexico’s entire power grid, over four times the total of all El Paso Electrics CO2 plant emissions in New Mexico and Texas, and over 12 times as much CO2 as the entire city of Las Cruces.
That is how much pollution will spew from Project Jupiter, a $165 billion dollar data center being built in Santa Teresa, New Mexico. Prior to the release of these air quality permit applications, with greenhouse gas emissions so high people assumed they were typos, Doña Ana County Commissioners gave the data center a $228M annual tax break accepting an incomplete proposal that had pages marked as drafts and others completely missing. 
The community, with only three weeks of advanced notice, had no strong enforceable commitments or any in-depth information available on water usage, electricity generation, environmental impacts, or noise and air pollution. The public simply did not have enough time to meaningfully participate in a decision that would alter their community for decades to come. 
Four months later, we are still in the dark. The language for daily operational water use has been changed to include the word, “potable.” The previous limits on total water use now only limit the amount of potable water used to run the facility. 
By any ethical standard, the public’s right to know how these changes impact their community is paramount and the project’s leadership has a moral obligation to communicate what the environmental impacts may be. The power generating “microgrid” has also been split into two separate facilities to skirt pollution controls. Staying just under their 250 tons per year limit on nitrogen oxides, one site will emit 249.97 tons per year and the other 248.9 tons per year. There is nothing “micro” about a plant that would emit more than double the greenhouse gas pollution of both Albuquerque and Las Cruces combined. 
Those most impacted by this project, the public at large who have long been separated from any form of public discourse, have not been given a voice in deciding the fate of the environment in which they live. We are promised 2,500 construction jobs, 750 long-term jobs, and $360 million to our county over the next 30 years. We have no reason to trust the industry or these commissioners and their false promises, especially given this project’s hasty and secretive development.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jupiter1-1024x683.png,,,2026-01-21 17:56:42.909784

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Mississippi received low marks for its infant and maternal mortality rates and high marks for declining HIV, syphilis and congenital syphilis rates on its public health report card for 2025. 
State Health Officer Dr. Edney celebrated Mississippi’s improved state ranking — rising to 48th in the country in America’s Health Rankings, up from 49th last year at a press conference Wednesday. 
“The health of our population is not great, but it’s better than it was,” Edney said.
America’s Health Rankings analyze 99 health measures and is released annually by the United Health Foundation — the philanthropic arm of UnitedHealth Group, the most profitable health care company in the U.S. The state’s annual report, which reviews the state’s health indicators and highlights areas of progress and those in need of improvement, is produced by the Mississippi Department of Health and the Mississippi State Medical Association. 
Mississippi has the highest rate of premature death, or deaths that could be prevented with timely and effective health care, in the nation. However, the estimated years of life lost to preventable deaths in the state declined this year. The report card estimates that about 190,000 years of life were lost before age 75 due to preventable deaths, like smoking-related deaths or deaths related to untreated chronic illnesses, in 2025.
Many of these lost years of life were tied to infant deaths, Edney said. He said lowering the state’s infant mortality rate — which is higher than anywhere else in the nation — is the Mississippi State Department of Health’s top priority. The agency declared a public health emergency over the infant mortality rate last year. 
Mississippi also has high rates of preventable deaths connected to heart disease, hypertension, obesity and diabetes and higher rates of firearm deaths than any other state in the country. 
High obesity rates — impacting 40% of adults — are a significant driver behind the state’s high rates of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and preterm births, Edney said. Heart disease is the state’s leading cause of death. 
“As we work to improve obesity, you will see all these other indicators improve as well,” Edney said. 
Mississippi saw notable progress in some areas of public health. There has been a reduction in opioid-related overdose deaths in the state for several years, Edney reported, bringing the state to the 10th lowest opioid overdose rate in the nation in 2024. HIV, syphilis and congenital syphilis rates also fell.
“Believe me, Alabama is looking over their shoulder at us today,” said Edney. Alabama ranked 47th in the state health rankings, outperforming Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas. 
Mississippi has long led the country in child vaccination rates, but remained in third place in 2025, the same ranking as last year, following a 2023 federal ruling that decreed parents can opt out of vaccinating their children for school due to religious beliefs. 
Public Health and Human Services Vice Chair Rep. Kevin Felsher, a Republican from Biloxi, said constituents can expect to see lawmakers focus on legislation to support cancer and diabetes screenings and proactive health care for Mississippians. 
Felsher proposed legislation this session to require health insurance plans to cover at-home colon cancer screening tests.
“Our goal, make no mistake about it, is to make Mississippi’s health care system what Mississippi’s education system has become,” Felsher said. 
Edney said the health department supports legislation to create the Fetal and Infant Mortality Review Panel, which would review the deaths of infants up to one year of age independently from the agency’s Child Death Review Panel and establish strategies to prevent infant deaths. 
“Mortality reviews really inform our work,” he said. “It tells us what’s wrong and where the pain points are and what we need to do to do better.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/21144355/3X0A8313.jpg,,,2026-01-21 17:56:42.909784

Jan. 14, 2026 | Photo  by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceFollowing a Friday decision to bar the state from spending contested work project funds, Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall told reporters he’d be open to restoring funds to some work projects through a supplemental budget, provided the Senate’s Democratic leadership abides by the transparency rules championed by the Republican-led House during last year’s budget negotiations. 
“Ultimately, we’ll get a deal. We’ll make a deal on the supplemental. It’ll have to go through HEAT – the Hall Ethics, Accountability and Transparency plan, something the Democrats don’t want,” the Richland Township Republican said during a press conference Wednesday.
In early December, Republican members of the House Appropriations Committee voted to disapprove $645 million in work project funds, prompting strong criticism from legislative Democrats, who called the vote “cruel” while noting these cuts included funds for programs to provide wigs for cancer patients, among other efforts.
Senate Democrats quickly moved to pass a $634 million supplemental budget to offset the cuts, which received the support of five Republican senators. Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) also requested an opinion from Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a fellow Democrat on whether the House could cancel the projects.
While Nessel declared the move to cancel the funds unconstitutional, House Republicans filed a lawsuit to bar state departments from using the funds. 
Michigan Court of Claims Judge Michael Gadola ruled Friday that the state cannot encumber, expend, transfer, or otherwise obligating any of the $645 million in unencumbered funds canceled by the House, though the order does not apply to any funds paid out by the budget office as of Sept. 15, 2025.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Hall also slammed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration, arguing they had failed to account for how much of the work project funding had been encumbered, or committed to a specific purpose.
When asked for comment Whitmer Press Secretary Stacey LaRouche directed Michigan Advance to the State Budget Office, which declined to comment on the record.
While Hall was willing to restore funding to some of the programs, he emphasized that not every dollar would be returned.
“My point is we’re not going to give the $600 million back, but maybe we’ll do $100 million, and then we’ll keep the other $500 million and that’ll be really helpful with the budget,” Hall said, giving a hypothetical scenario. 
In the coming budget, Hall said lawmakers will need to pursue $1.2 billion in their next budget to account for a decrease in projected state revenue.

Two former school superintendents and a consultant have pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to commit embezzlement. They face up to five years in prison. 
Earl Jo Nelson, as superintendent of Clarksdale Municipal School District and later Leake County School District, and Mario Willis, as superintendent of Hollandale School District, paid each other tens of thousands of dollars in school funds for consultant services that were never rendered from November 2021 until at least June 2023, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
During that time frame, Hollandale School District sent nearly $100,000 to companies to benefit Nelson. Additionally, Clarksdale Municipal School District sent about $25,400 and Leake County School District sent about $23,400 to companies to benefit Willis.
While superintendent, Willis also sent $250,000 to a company owned by Monekea Smith-Taylor, a St. Louis-based teacher, for consulting services that were not actually provided. She would then meet Willis in person and pay him, often exactly half of what she had been paid, in cash.
Nelson and Smith-Taylor pleaded guilty during an appearance before U.S. District Judge Sharion Aycock on Tuesday, according to the release. Willis pleaded guilty to the same conspiracy charge during his October court date. 
The trio has not been sentenced. Aycock scheduled a sentencing hearing for later this year. 
The state auditor’s office and the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Inspector General are investigating the case.

Jill Krowinski,  D-Burlington, was elected Speaker of the House in 2021. It was the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, and state coffers were unexpectedly flush with federal relief money. But just as that federal pot of dollars has since dried up, property taxes have risen and voters took out their frustration at the ballot box. In 2024, Vermont Democrats lost the most Democratic seats in the country, and  with them their veto-proof supermajority in the Legislature.
This month, as Gov. Phil Scott declared his roadmap for the Legislative session, Krowinski’s skills as a diplomat are being tested as never before. Scott unveiled a $9.4 billion state budget this week, and declared that he would essentially hold that budget hostage — that is, unless the Legislature comes up with a plan to consolidate Vermont’s 119 school districts into a few larger districts.
Krowinski bristled at the governor’s approach. “Our goal here is to ensure that our kids are getting the best education at a price that Vermonters can afford. I will say that threatening a budget veto is really not helpful at this time, we need to be working together to find solutions and not making threats.” 
The governor also plans to end Vermont’s emergency motel voucher program to combat homelessness, and re-invest in affordable housing development and social services. Krowinski said the move falls short of the current, critical need. 
“We don’t have the shelter capacity right now to help the thousands of Vermonters that are unhoused, and we have 1,000 kids right now that are unhoused, and that really is going to keep me up at night thinking about this weekend” when sub-zero temperatures are forecasted. She noted that money allocated to nonprofit housing organizations had not been distributed by the Scott administration, and said he House will be investigating the matter to “ensure that we’re not leaving money on the table.”
The governor must now win over Krowinski and her legislative colleagues as he attempts to pass his agenda.
“We’re not coming in just starting from fresh,” Krowinski said. “The progress that we’ve made on issues like child care that’s made a huge difference in affordability for Vermont families, the tax credits that we’ve put out there to help to help older Vermonters and to help families with kids, looking at our long term investments in housing, how we’ve been able to bend the cost curve some on health care.”
Krowinski has also seen the impacts of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown across the country. “I am so completely outraged, disgusted, frustrated with what’s happening across our country. I actually witnessed an ICE arrest while I was in Washington, DC, and the illegal, excessive force used was shocking.” Krowinski said that Vermont is prepared in some ways and unprepared in others. 
The turmoil is also personal. Last June, the 45-year old Burlington Democrat was deeply shaken by the politically-motivated assassinations of her friend and colleague, former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband. 
“It is important for Vermonters to know that these threats do happen in Vermont,” said Krowinski, who in 2022 was stalked by a man with a gun in his car at the State House. “I’m just angry about it,” she said of the threats. “I’m not changing anything. … I’m not going to let them control my life or change it in ways that I don’t want it to be changed. It took me some time to come to this place, but I’m fired up now, and it’s important for me to offer this type of support to other members or elected officials who have gone through it.”

Greg Casar and Jasmine Crockett of Texas did not vote.The resolution covering Hillary Clinton was narrower, 28-15, with only three Democrats, Lee, Stansbury and Tlaib, voting in favor.Subpoenas defied by Clintons, othersRepublicans on the committee, including Chairman James Comer of Kentucky, said the Clintons defied subpoenas to provide depositions about Epstein’s long-running record of sexual abuse of young girls. “No witness, not a former president or a private citizen, may willfully defy a duly issued congressional subpoena without consequence,” Comer said. “But that is what the Clintons did.”Democrats said they, too, wanted to hear testimony from the Clintons, whose depositions were ordered by bipartisan subpoenas last year, but that the committee Republicans were singling out the couple because of their partisan affiliation. Various other officials, of both parties, who’d received subpoenas also did not comply. Neither did Epstein’s co-conspirator, Ghislane Maxwell. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump has not turned over documents related to the investigation, despite a November law requiring their full release, Democrats on the panel said. Yet only the Clintons, influential Democrats, were being prosecuted for defying the committee, Democrats said.“It’s interesting that it’s this subpoena only that Republicans and the chairman have been obsessed about putting all their energy behind,” ranking Democrat Robert Garcia, of California, said. Comer responded that the other examples were different. Other officials had less personal knowledge of Epstein than the Clintons; Maxwell had said she would invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, obviating the need for testimony; and the Justice Department was working, however slowly, on releasing the millions of documents required under the law, he said.“As I've stated many times publicly, we wish this process was going quicker,” he said. “There’s a lot of documents, a lot of redactions. A lot of eyes have to be put on this. The Department of Justice is complying.”In an open letter to Comer last week, the Clintons said they were working to assist in the investigation, but complained they were being treated more harshly than other witnesses, while also criticizing Comer’s handling of the case.“Despite everything that needs to be done to help our country, you are on the cusp of bringing Congress to a halt to pursue a rarely used process literally designed to result in our imprisonment,” they wrote. “This is not the way out of America’s ills, and we will forcefully defend ourselves.”Negotiations or stalling?Members of each party argued over various issues the panel members had been negotiating with the Clintons, such as the location of the interview, whether notes or a transcript would be allowed and whether the Clintons could provide written testimony only, as other witnesses had.Democrats on the panel said the Clintons and their lawyers had been working with the committee in good faith to iron out those issues. But Comer said they were stalling the panel in the hopes that Democrats would retake the House in November.“We have been negotiating for five months,” Comer said. “This is clearly a stall tactic, hoping that the time clock runs out and the House flips and you all let them off the hook.”Contrary to Democrats’ argument, not every witness was allowed to offer written testimony, Comer added, including Republican former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr. Hillary Clinton inclusion questionedBill Clinton had a well-documented personal relationship with Epstein, including travel on the billionaire’s private plane. Photos of the two were among the documents released in the initial tranche the Justice Department provided under the November law.But Garcia objected to the inclusion of Hillary Clinton in the committee’s resolution Wednesday, saying the available evidence appeared to confirm her public account that she had no knowledge of Epstein’s activities.“No one who is serious about justice for Epstein’s survivors believes that Hillary Clinton has somehow been involved in Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes,” Garcia said. He added that Trump pledged to prosecute Hillary Clinton after he won the 2016 presidential campaign against her. Garcia said it appeared Trump was weaponizing the federal government against a political opponent. Other Democrats said the committee was enforcing Trump’s political prosecution.Comer said Hillary Clinton had a personal relationship with Maxwell and a financial one with Epstein.Trump also had a personal relationship with Epstein for years. Democrats on the panel repeated Wednesday the widely made assertion that Trump’s Justice Department was shielding the president by resisting the production of documents.",,,,2026-01-21 17:56:42.909784

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Friday is “ICE Out of Minnesota: Day of Truth & Freedom,” a general strike supported by Minnesota’s unions, progressive faith leaders, Democratic lawmakers and community activists.
The “ICE Out” day proponents are encouraging all Minnesotans to stay home from work, school and refrain from shopping — suspensions of normal orders of business to protest the presence of federal immigration agents in Minnesota.
A general strike is a work stoppage across multiple industries. The overall goal is to pause economic activity to compel change. General strikes are uncommon in modern America but were once a staple of protest politics and are still frequently employed in Europe.
Citing the killing of Renee Good by federal agent Jonathan Ross, the “ICE Out” day organizers say the general strike is intended to be a day of nonviolent reflection.
“It is time to suspend the normal order of business to demand immediate cessation of ICE actions in Minnesota, accountability for federal agents who have caused loss of life and abuse to Minnesota residents and call for Congress to immediately intervene,” the website states.
Demonstrators will march and rally in downtown Minneapolis Friday starting at 2 p.m.
Over 100 businesses, restaurants and co-ops in the Twin Cities have announced plans to close Friday, according to Bring Me The News, which is keeping a running list.
Minneapolis was home to a landmark general strike nearly 100 years ago that was organized by truck drivers with the Teamsters Local 574. Minneapolis then was a non-union town thanks to a business advocacy group called the Citizens Alliance.
Many companies had refused to recognize Teamsters Local 574, despite the union’s 5,000 members. On May 16, 1934, workers began a strike, demanding recognition of the union, wage increases and fewer hours. The union organized warehouses, coal yards and drivers.
The strike caused Minneapolis’ industrial area — now the North Loop neighborhood — to shut down. Trucks couldn’t go in or out, and tensions grew.
On July 20, 1934, police shot 67 picketing workers — most of them were shot in the back — and two were killed. One hundred thousand people attended the funeral procession for one of the strikers. The governor dispatched the National Guard, and the Citizens Alliance eventually agreed to the union’s demands, making the general strike a success.
Today, general strikes are rare in the U.S. largely because they are difficult to coordinate. But lawmakers and the courts for decades have also restricted the power of unions.
The two largest general strikes in U.S. history are the Seattle General Strike of 1919, where the city of 315,000 people stopped working, and the Oakland General Strike of 1946, where nearly 130,000 workers refused to work and shut down commerce throughout the area.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_2719-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-21 17:56:42.909784
,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-21 22:07:03+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Senate and House aligning on evidence-based reading instruction,Sam Drysdale | State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/education/senate-and-house-aligning-on-evidence-based-reading-instruction/,"While the state continues to rank among national leaders, MCAS data show that only about 42 percent of third-graders are meeting state expectations in English language arts, with significantly lower rates among students of color, low-income students, English language learners and students with disabilities.","THE SENATE WILL take up its own version of a House-approved early literacy reform bill next week, increasing the likelihood that a new law could emerge in 2026 addressing the controversial question of how reading should be taught in schools.
The House passed its bill (H 4683) in October, advancing a sweeping effort to regulate early reading instruction amid what top lawmakers describe as a growing literacy crisis. A growing number of states have reshaped early literacy education around the “science of reading,” a research base emphasizing explicit, systematic phonics instruction.
Senate President Karen Spilka announced the Senate’s move Wednesday morning in a Substack post, saying the Senate Ways and Means Committee will release its version of the bill Thursday, with floor debate expected on Thursday, January 29. While she did not outline specific provisions, Spilka said the Senate bill will largely track the House’s approach in an effort to deliver a final bill to Gov. Maura Healey quickly.
“I can say that the Senate will join the House in backing evidence-based literacy learning programs that are proven to help our children,” Spilka wrote. “The House passed a comprehensive bill, and the Senate bill will echo many of their initiatives.”
A Senate companion bill to the House-approved legislation was redrafted by the Joint Committee on Education in December (S 2855) and given a favorable review to the Senate Ways and Means Committee. Sens. Sal DiDomenico, Robyn Kennedy, Jason Lewis and Pavel Payano voted favorably, while Sens. Patricia Jehlen and Patrick O’Connor reserved their right to vote.
The legislation comes as student reading performance in Massachusetts has slipped in recent years. While the state continues to rank among national leaders, MCAS data show that only about 42 percent of third-graders are meeting state expectations in English language arts, with significantly lower rates among students of color, low-income students, English language learners and students with disabilities. Lawmakers say the declines underscore the need for statewide intervention.
“If I’ve said it once, I’ve said it a hundred times: education is Massachusetts’ lodestar,” Spilka wrote. “We have a lot to be proud of when it comes to education in our state. But we should make changes when students’ overall success is threatened.”
The House-approved bill would require school districts to adopt state-approved literacy curricula for kindergarten through third grade that address five research-based components of reading: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.
It also mandates that K-3 students be screened at least twice a year using approved literacy tools, with targeted intervention and parental notification when students fall below benchmarks tied to age-appropriate development. The bill sets new standards for teacher preparation programs, requires regular evaluations of those programs by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE), and expands professional development requirements for educators.
A central — and controversial — feature of the bill is its restriction on certain instructional methods. Curricula that rely on “implicit or incidental” word-reading strategies, including visual memorization of whole words, guessing from context or pictures, such as the “three-cueing” approach, would be largely prohibited.
Supporters say those guardrails are necessary to align classroom practice with decades of cognitive science research on how children learn to read. Critics argue the language amounts to a ban on widely used “balanced literacy” approaches and intrudes on local control.
Sen. Sal DiDomenico filed the companion bill to the one the House advanced. The bills received their public hearing in September and drew hours of testimony from educators, parents, advocates and union leaders.
Massachusetts Teachers Association President Max Page warned that statewide curriculum requirements risk undermining teacher professionalism and flexibility.
“Having the Legislature dictate a particular curriculum and a particular mode is really dangerous and problematic,” Page told lawmakers. “[It] undermines the professionalism of our educators who are working with a diverse student body and trying to address their needs as best as possible.”
Page said no one is satisfied with current literacy outcomes, but argued the state should invest more heavily in reading specialists, class size reduction and instructional support rather than banning specific practices.
Supporters countered that decades of uneven results demonstrate that district-by-district discretion has failed many students.
“Only four in 10 Massachusetts students are reading at grade level,” said Mary Tamer, founder of MassPotential and a leader of the MassReads coalition backing the bill. “With far fewer in high-poverty districts, flexibility is not working.”
DiDomenico pressed union leaders at the hearing, saying the state has a responsibility to intervene when outcomes reach crisis levels.
“The data here shows clearly that what is happening today is not working,” he said. “We’re saying pick a curriculum that is evidence-based. The results are not there according to what we hope to see for our students.”
The state’s second-largest teachers union, AFT Massachusetts, did not outright oppose or support the bill. 
AFT Massachusetts President Jessica Tang said it is “concerning” that the House-approved bill “establishes a limited, blanket curriculum… Even more concerning is that it bans important, proven tools our educators currently use and use successfully, particularly with our English language learners and students with special needs.” 
However, Tang also lauded parts of the legislation such as reporting and tracking measures, expanded funding opportunities and a new commission focused on advancing literacy.
A 2024 MassINC poll found 84 percent of Massachusetts parents support requiring schools to use research-backed reading curricula.
In her “guest post” on MassSenate Substack titled “We Can’t Lead If Kids Can’t Read,” Spilka also tied the legislation to her own family’s experience. Her eldest son struggled to learn to read in elementary school, she wrote, prompting her family to step in with phonics-based support at home until his skills reached grade level.
She described swapping out a Bruce Springsteen album on their family turntable for a “Hooked on Phonics” record.
“As a parent, it was hard to see my son struggle with something as foundational as reading,” Spilka wrote. “As a legislator, I now know that our family was not alone — and that not every child has the resources and extra help that my son had.”
The News Service reported earlier in January that Mary Tamer, executive director of education reform nonprofit MassPotential, said the Senate would vote on the issue “very early in this first quarter.”
If the Senate passes a literacy bill, it would head back to the House for concurrence or compromise before landing on Gov. Healey’s desk. Healey has indicated early literacy reform is a priority for her administration and has backed significant investments in the area.
Around the same time Spilka’s newsletter went out Wednesday morning, the Healey administration announced the expansion of its free early literacy tutoring program to 84 additional elementary schools, bringing participation to more than 350 schools statewide.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pexels-photo-8466772.jpeg?fit=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-21 17:56:42.909784

(File photo courtesy of SCDOT)COLUMBIA — Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency Wednesday ahead of an expected winter storm that could bring a mix of sleet, ice and snow to parts of South Carolina.
Forecasters say widespread power outages are possible and could last for multiple days.
The governor’s order activates the state Emergency Operations Plan and allows the National Guard to call up troops and prepare equipment.
“Preparations are already underway by state agencies, and this State of Emergency ensures Team South Carolina is ready to respond and support communities as conditions develop,” McMaster said in a release.
The National Weather Service on Wednesday issued a winter storm watch for Upstate South Carolina, effective from 7 a.m. Saturday to 1 p.m. Monday. A winter storm watch for Chesterfield and Lancaster counties also starts Saturday morning. A watch means heavy snow, freezing rain or sleet is possible.
McMaster urged residents to get prepared, saying “winter weather can chance quickly and create hazardous conditions with little notice.”
The state Department of Transportation posted on social media that “it’s ready for whatever winter weather brings to our state.”  That includes having 60,000 tons of salt and 1,200 pieces of equipment staged statewide to treat roadways where needed, according to the post.
The state Emergency Management Division has an online guide for winter weather preparedness. Advice includes:

Stock up on nonperishable food and water for at least three days. Don’t forget a manual can opener.
Follow safety tips when using alternative heating appliances.
Check your battery supply for cell phones, flashlights, and other essentials. Recharge everything.
Stay off the roads if possible. Recognize that bridges and overpasses ice up before other roads.

It’s been 12 years since a major ice storm crippled parts of South Carolina. In February 2014, more than an inch of ice accumulated, downing trees and power lines and leaving more than 350,000 people without power at the storm’s peak.

“Nobody is above the rule of law, including federal agents such as ICE or border patrol,” Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a statement. “This new reporting form is about keeping our communities safe and reminding them that we have their back. If you see misconduct from a federal agent, we want to hear about it.”
Unlawful activity by federal agents could include use of excessive force, unlawful searches or arrests, wrongful detentions, interference with voting, or other civil rights violations, according to the complaint page.

A news release from Weiser’s office says information submitted through the complaint system will help the attorney general’s office ensure federal accountability and identify patterns of misconduct by federal agents. His office will review reports and share necessary information with government offices or oversight agencies, including local district attorneys or elected members of Congress. 
Complaints can be submitted anonymously. Fields asking for name and email in the complaint form are optional. 
While the impact of the new complaint system is yet to be seen, Karen Orona, spokesperson for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, said it sends a strong message that the state is committed to upholding laws and protecting the civil rights of people in the state, regardless of immigration status. 
“It is encouraging when elected officials take a public stance prioritizing community safety and explicitly affirming the belonging of all community members,” Orona said in a statement
In Minnesota, ICE agents have broken car windows and arrested observers as part of the Trump administration’s growing crackdown in the state. Minnesotans have increased efforts to observe and protest ICE actions after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis. About 3,000 ICE agents are deployed to the Twin Cities. 
Weiser, a Democrat, is running to be governor of Colorado.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Accessibility and safety upgrades and even some new masonry and roofing will be among the facility improvements arts and culture organizations will be able to make this year thanks to voters.
The Rhode Island Council on the Arts has awarded nearly $2.75 million in grants to improve facilities at 17 arts and culture organizations statewide, the  arts council announced at a public ceremony for the recipients on Jan. 16. 
The grants are funded through the State Cultural Facilities Grant Program, for which voters approved a $4 million infusion as part of a larger $10 million arts and culture bond on the November 2024 ballot. 
“Making cultural facilities more modern and accessible positions them for long-term success and makes a real difference in their communities,” Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement. “I’m proud to see the results of what Rhode Islanders made possible when they voted to support this bond.”
The matching grants are intended for capital projects rather than day-to-day operating costs. The money can be used to improve venues’ ADA accessibility, building and fire code compliance, energy efficiency, or other expansions and enhancements to recipients’ spaces.
Faye Zuckerman, the arts council’s spokesperson, said in an email Wednesday that the grant money functions as a “reimbursement program,” and that recipients receive their funds when they submit eligible expenses. 
Zuckerman noted that the agency’s board reviewed and approved all the recommendations at its December 2025 meeting. 
She also confirmed that the arts agency “held back some funding for a future grant opening” from the $4 million voters approved. 
The biggest award is $500,000 for Pawtucket’s Capeverdean American Community Development, which intends to use the money for building, accessibility and HVAC upgrades, including repairing its crumbling masonry. The organization serves as a hub for Rhode Island’s Cape Verdean community and a RISCA document notes that the money will help the nonprofit “create a premier cultural facility.”
Other large awards include $331,652 for the Sandra Feinstein-Gamm Theatre in Warwick, where the money will help create a lab space for a new play development program and other educational initiatives. The theater also wants to make its lobby more accessible.
The Friends of Linden Place — the popular downtown Bristol tour site and wedding venue whose centerpiece is the 19th-century mansion once owned by slave trader George DeWolf — was awarded $331,280 to harden the property against water damage caused by heavy rain. The Friends will use the money to replace the roofs on three buildings, including the carriage house that’s home to the Bristol Art Museum.  
The Southside Cultural Center of Rhode Island in Providence is getting $250,000 for a new elevator so patrons can access the 300-seat theater on the fourth floor, and the Newport Art Museum was awarded $211,841 to improve its historic Griswold House, which was built in 1864 and houses many of the museum’s permanent collections and large exhibitions. 
Other recipients include:

Preserve RI for the Lippitt House Museum in Providence, $200,000 
South County Art Association in Kingston, $200,000
Newport Historical Society, $165,366
DownCity Design in Providence, $100,000
The Greenwich Odeum in East Greenwich, $100,000
La Farge Restoration Fund at Newport Congregational Church, $100,000
The Granite Theatre in Westerly, $92,522
Oasis International in Providence, $70,000
Riverzedge Arts Project in Woonsocket, $44,240
Newport Classical, $32,860
Artists’ Exchange in Cranston, $14,125
South County Museum in Narragansett, $3,200

According to the arts council’s grant chart, the total funding is $2,747,086. 
The remainder of the 2024 bond directed capital improvement money to three specific organizations: the Tomaquag Museum, Newport Contemporary Ballet and Trinity Repertory Company.  
The projects are anticipated to have a useful life of 20 years. With interest, the $10 million bond is expected to cost $16,052,500, according to the 2024 voter information handbook.
Arts and culture bonds have historically been successful on ballots in the Ocean State. Comparable bundles of grants were approved by about 60% of voters in both 2014 and 2021. The 2014 bond was for $30 million and benefitted nine organizations. The 2021 bond was the smallest of all three, at $7 million.  
In a statement, the council’s Executive Director Todd Trebour nodded at these previously successful bonds as having “statewide economic impact.” Across both the 2014 and 2021 iterations, 90% of the funds from these bonds were spent in all of Rhode Island’s 39 municipalities, according to Trebour.

(Photo Illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)A Republican-backed bill that would give broader liability protection to pesticide and herbicide companies such as Bayer, the owner of Roundup, faltered in a Tennessee House committee Wednesday.
Rep. Rusty Grills of Newbern declined to present House Bill 809 in the House Judiciary Committee even though numerous supporters from the Farm Bureau packed the hearing room. Grills did not attend the meeting and wasn’t available for comment immediately.
The measure, which passed the Senate in 2025, would provide legal immunity to pesticide manufacturers as long as their federally-approved label doesn’t warn of a disease. Roundup’s Environmental Protection Agency label doesn’t disclose that their product could cause cancer, meaning under this legislation, the company couldn’t be sued for causing the disease. 
Rep. Rusty Grills, sponsor of a bill to limit liability of pesticide companies, was not present in the committee in which the bill was to be debated on Wednesday. Photographs by John Partipilo/ Tennessee Lookout
Grills was expected to present his bill Wednesday but, instead, requested that it be taken off notice. The bill could be revived, but so many questions have been raised about the measure that it isn’t expected to be brought back for consideration.
Democratic Rep. Gloria Johnson of Knoxville called it a “victory,” saying she had received numerous phone calls from opponents of the bill.
“Folks out there know just how damaging this is to Tennessee citizens. We need clean water, we need clean air, but we also need clean soil to plant in, farmers get this is a problem,” Johnson said.
Kevin Hensley, a lobbyist for the Tennessee Farm Bureau, declined to speak about the bill’s apparent demise Wednesday. Hensley last year told the lawmakers the bill would avert only cases involving product labels approved by the Environmental Protection Agency, and he contended that companies don’t control what goes on those labels.
Republican Rep. Clay Doggett of Pulaski said supporters worked on the bill for the past nine months to come up with a compromise.
“I think it was the right move to take it off notice and try to work through some of those legal issues and make sure if there is a product that comes back to the committee, it’s going to be one that everyone can agree is good policy,” Doggett said.
Republican Sen. John Stevens of Huntingdon, who carried the Senate version of the bill, defended the bill last year by saying manufacturers don’t have an option on a label’s wording and can’t defend themselves against claims, forcing them to pay high litigation costs.
At least one farmer testified last year that modern pesticides allow farmers to till the ground less and control erosion.
Critics of the bill argued that it would remove people’s constitutional rights to a jury trial when diagnosed with deadly forms of cancer such as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
As the bill was being considered in 2025, a Georgia jury ordered Germany-based Bayer, the parent company of Monsanto, to pay almost $2.1 billion to a man who claimed he contracted the disease from using the company’s Roundup weed killer. 
Similar legislation has been rejected in Iowa, Missouri, Idaho, Wyoming and Mississippi, yet Bayer-Monsanto didn’t pull products from shelves, even while facing more than 170,000 lawsuits, leading opponents to say the chemical maker is more concerned with increasing earnings than protecting people.

On Wednesday afternoon, a conservative political action committee in Montana released the first attack ad against Bodnar.
The ad was posted on the Facebook page of the Leadership in Action PAC, which lists Attorney General Austin Knudsen as honorary chairman.
Jake Eaton, a Republican political consultant who managed Gov.

Bob Ferguson on Wednesday requested the Trump administration approve a major disaster declaration to open up federal funding in response to the historic flooding that beset the state last month. 
Washington state officials will next await word from President Donald Trump, who has declined to approve such declarations in some cases, especially in Democrat-led states. Ferguson and Trump clashed on the state’s request related to the 2024 bomb cyclone. Trump previously approved a federal emergency declaration, allowing federal resources to help during the flooding in December.
Ferguson requested the Federal Emergency Management Agency open up over $21 million in federal assistance to help individuals affected by the flooding. The money is meant to help repair their homes or help them find stable housing, but it won’t make them whole, the governor cautioned.
An ask for federal money for infrastructure repairs and work to prepare for future storms will come from the state before Feb. 18, as it’s still unclear exactly how much damage was done. 
The state Department of Transportation recently told lawmakers that the heavy flooding inflicted at least $40 million to $50 million of damage on the state’s highways. 
The record-breaking flooding left over 100,000 Washingtonians under evacuation orders and nearly 4,000 homes damaged, according to the governor. Almost 400 people needed to be rescued. One person died. Thirty-three rivers reached flood stage.
“This historic disaster is of such severity and magnitude that effective recovery exceeds the capability of the state and local governments in impacted areas, requiring supplemental federal assistance to recover from this disaster,” Ferguson wrote in his letter to Trump.
Ferguson expects the state’s congressional delegation and leaders of the Democratic and Republican caucuses in both chambers of the Legislature to send letters supporting his request.
The state has provided nearly $1 million in state aid to roughly 2,600 households, according to the governor’s office.
The request for federal aid for individuals, which stretches over 100 pages, is focused on Chelan, Grays Harbor, King, Lewis, Pacific, Pierce, Skagit, Snohomish, Thurston and Whatcom counties, as well as many tribal nations.
If Trump approves of Ferguson’s plea, the next step for residents will be applying for funding from FEMA. It would also allow homeowners, renters, business owners and nonprofits to apply for low-interest loans through the U.S. Small Business Administration.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/snohomis-county-flooding-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-21 16:58:48.215646

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/21/ct-child-tax-credit-advocates/,Advocates for a CT child tax credit say federal cuts to human service programs and tariff-driven inflation now make relief critical.,"Advocates for a new state tax cut for low- and middle-income households with children are intensifying their push in this spring’s General Assembly session, insisting federal cuts to human service programs and tariff-driven inflation now make relief critical.
Policy research and academic groups joined constitutional officers, legislators and others at a Wednesday forum in the Legislative Office Building to also insist a $600-per-child credit, up to $1,800 per household, also would be a key driver of Connecticut’s future economy.
Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have a child-based credit within their income tax systems, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But in 2019, just two years before Congress ordered a temporary one-year increase in the federal child tax credit to help families harmed by the COVID pandemic, only two states offered such relief, said John Iselin, associate director of economic analysis at Yale University’s Budget Lab.
On other words, states saw firsthand the anti-poverty effects of child-based tax relief and saw how quickly the situation can reverse itself when that assistance isn’t offered.
“We can see directly that people have been able to pay rent, they’ve been able to provide more food resources for their family and spend the dollars on a range of different uses for their children,” Iselin said, adding it allows families to dedicate more for health care and education — and also save to help their children in these and other areas as they mature.
Connecticut’s child poverty rate, which stood at 6.8% when the federal credit was expanded, surged to 11.8% shortly after that extra relief went away, according to Connecticut Voices for Children, a New Haven-based policy research group that supports a state child tax credit.
Iselin said states that create such a credit generally can shave between 1 and 4.5 percentage points off their child poverty rates.
More recently, Congress and President Donald Trump ordered cuts that will strip almost $1 trillion from Medicaid, other human services, green energy and student loan programs over the next decade.
Those cutbacks, coupled with new Trump administration tariffs that have raised prices on various consumer goods, have left about 40% of households here unable to support a basic survival budget, said Lisa Tepper Bates, president and CEO of the United Way of Connecticut.
“This isn’t a year like any other year,” she said at Wednesday’s forum.
The United Way’s state chapter is supporting a $600 credit that is fully refundable. That means even if a household earns so little it has no state tax liability to apply the credit to, it would have $600 per child added to its refund. 
Keeping more children out of poverty, and ultimately helping them get better educated, increases their likelihood of contributing to the state’s economy when they reach adulthood, said state Treasurer Erick Russell.
“It’s about keeping families here in the state, growing our economy, but also understanding the more people that we have who can meaningfully participate in our economy, the better it is for the state overall,” he said.
And while Connecticut contains some of the wealthiest municipalities in the country, particularly in Fairfield county, it also is home to some of the poorest urban centers in the U.S.
Caitlyn Gelfand, an early childhood educator in Bristol — which ranks in the bottom half of Connecticut municipalities in terms of median income — said it’s hard to understand why the state, given its overall wealth, doesn’t do more for families when the need is clear.
“Everyone outside of Connecticut pictures Greenwich and Yale and Gilmore Girls and Hallmark Christmas movies,” she said. “But Connecticut is also Waterbury and North Hartford and Bridgeport and New Britain, and all of us deserve access and comfort.”
Juan Hernandez of Colchester, one of several parents at the forum and the father of three children, said a state child tax credit would have been very helpful four years ago when he battled cancer and his wife also missed time at work to help care for him.
Hernandez predicted enactment of a credit this year would be a godsend for many. 
“It touches everyone,” he said. “It’s finally a prayer being answered.”
The Democratic-controlled General Assembly has been weighing proposals to create a permanent child tax credit since 2021. But except for a one-time income tax rebate ordered in 2022, which provided $250 per child, nothing has been enacted.
Gov. Ned Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, and many Republicans in the House and Senate minorities have favored broader forms of tax relief.
House Republicans last October proposed cutting state taxes on the middle class by as much as $700 per year by boosting a credit that offsets a portion of municipal property tax bills. But the GOP plan would offer little to no benefit to Connecticut’s working poor since it would not be refundable.
The Republican plan would cost about $500 million per year, while the most popular child tax credit plan carries an annual price tag of about $350 million.
The General Assembly and Lamont ordered in 2023 the state’s first income tax rate reduction since the mid-1990s, which has returned about $300 per year to middle-class households. They have assisted the poorest of working households by boosting the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit to 41.5% of the federal EITC. This returned an average of $1,060 to about 185,000 households that generally earn less than $69,000 per year.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said Wednesday that “Gov. Lamont has ensured that affordability and opportunity are at the heart of his legislative agenda and every budget he’s signed.”
The governor’s tax commissioner, former Danbury Mayor Mark Boughton, who also attended the forum, said “the gulf between the haves and — for lack of a better term — have-nots in our state has gotten worse.”
But Boughton said that while a child tax credit could assist those in need, Connecticut requires a multi-faceted response that also includes more job training and other economic initiatives.
Lamont must deliver his updated budget proposal for the 2026-27 fiscal year to the General Assembly on Feb. 4.
“The governor looks forward to collaborating with legislators as we approach the upcoming session and look to make any budget adjustments, while ensuring our fiscal health remains strong,” Collibee said.
Though not speaking against tax relief, Lamont — who is seeking reelection this year for a third term — has been cautious when addressing the topic, reminding others that Connecticut stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in annual federal assistance because of cuts ordered by Trump and the GOP-led Congress.
But state Comptroller Sean Scanlon, a Guilford Democrat who spearheaded early efforts to establish a child tax credit when he served in the legislature in 2021, said Connecticut is in a much stronger financial position now that it was even a few years ago.
The state legislature established aggressive new budget caps in 2017 that have forced unprecedented surpluses averaging more than $1.8 billion over the past eight years. Governors and legislatures have used those surplus funds to create one of the largest rainy day funds in the nation while wiping out roughly $10 billion in pension debt.
Connecticut also remains one of the highest-earning states, per capita, in the nation.
“We have to think we have the abundance here to meet these needs,” Scanlon said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-31-at-10.06.20-AM.png,,,2026-01-21 16:58:48.215646

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama Senate committee approved a bill Wednesday that would require the Alabama Medicaid Agency and Department of Human Resources to cross-check eligibility for assistance programs.
SB 61, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, would require the agencies to conduct at least monthly checks of enrollees of each program. According to the Legislative Fiscal Office, the additional work for both agencies could cost at least $16.7 million per year total for both agencies. 
Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, who carried the bill in the Senate General Fund Finance and Taxation Committee, said in an interview after the meeting that the bill intends to eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse” in the state’s Medicaid program and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

“Those are real aspects, and we have to watch and care for those programs that we’re funding to help those that are truly in need and prevent those that are taking advantage,” Albritton said.
In July, DHR’s food assistant director said that out of $1.77 billion issued in SNAP benefits in Alabama in fiscal year 2024, payment errors totaled about $36,000, which were rarely due to fraud. 
 Sen. Merika Coleman, D-Pleasant Grove, said the state’s low error rate and lack of widespread fraud should be celebrated.
“In the state of Alabama, according to what we’ve heard and what we may hear next week, we don’t have this huge number of waste, fraud and abuse in our state, and we should applaud our folks for that, not make it appear punitive,” she said.
Orr has filed a version of the bill nearly every year since 2016, but the legislation never left the Senate. Carol Gundlach, a senior policy analyst for Alabama Arise who spoke in opposition to the bill at a public hearing Wednesday morning, hopes that this version will meet the same fate.
“The SNAP program, especially in Alabama, is a really well-run program. They do it very efficiently and at an economic cost that is not too burdensome for the state,” Gundlach said in an interview after the meeting. “If it’s not broken, why are we trying to fix it?”
DHR Commissioner Nancy Buckner said the bill  would drive up administrative and labor costs and create unnecessary hurdles for SNAP enrollees.
“It will cost a lot of money, and I really didn’t want to get into the specifics of the bill, out of respect for Sen. Orr,” Buckner said. “Now, he’s heard me for the last eight years, but I have not talked to him about this bill this year.”
The bill requires DHR and other state agencies to check recipients’ home addresses, death records and incarceration status on a monthly basis. The bill also requires Alabama Medicaid and other state agencies to check recipients’ income, employment and disability status on a quarterly basis.
Buckner said that about 702,000 Alabamians are enrolled in SNAP, about half of whom are children. Coleman said that every lawmaker has a constituent enrolled in the food assistance program.
“Just for my colleagues to get the bird’s eye view of who are these people that are receiving these benefits, especially the senior citizens, the children,” Coleman said. 
Supporters of the bill said that it is needed because of the state’s error rate for SNAP, which is when either DHR or enrollees make a mistake on paperwork which results in too many or too little benefits in a given month. For fiscal year 2024, Alabama’s error rate was 8.32%, under the national average of 10.93%, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Buckner told lawmakers the current error rate is around 9%. 
“I don’t have a lot of confidence in what that error rate tells us or doesn’t tell us,” Albritton said in an interview. “We are more concerned on the Alabama front as to whether we are actually getting the services to the people that need it, rather than to the people that just simply can access it. We’ve got to get the public’s trust that we are actually doing our part in that regard before we can move forward with the bill, and also with this program. Public trust is the important part that we’re seeking.”
Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, the only abstention, said eliminating “waste, fraud and abuse” is good, but it is the governments’ responsibility to protect programs that help those who cannot help themselves.
“Because we live in a society, a fallen society where people try to take advantage of programs, there are times that we need to do things to keep that from happening, to preserve the programs for those who it is intended for,” Chambliss said. “I have some concerns with this language.”
Senate Majority Leader Steve Livingston, R-Scottsboro, voted for the bill but said it needs work before it is brought to the full Senate.
“It needs a lot of work, we need to talk to Arthur,” Livingston said in an interview.
Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, said the bill has more room for harm than good.
“There are some good merits about it,” Coleman-Madison said. “That is not a positive vote, because there’s potential for more harm and not saving any money, putting departments through unnecessary hoops.”

,California,2026-01-21 21:33:21+00:00,CalMatters,White House blocks Gavin Newsom from interview at official U.S. venue in Davos,Jeanne Kuang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2026/01/newsom-davos-interview-trump/,Newsom’s scheduled interview in Davos was canceled Wednesday after the Trump administration denied him access to the official U.S. venue.,"In summary
Newsom’s scheduled interview in Davos was canceled Wednesday after the Trump administration denied him access to the official U.S. venue.


Gov. Gavin Newsom accused the White House of blocking a magazine interview at the official U.S. venue at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, a day after Newsom criticized European leaders for not pushing back harder against President Donald Trump.
The incident marks another escalation in the governor’s long-running feud with Trump and his administration. Newsom and the president have not spoken since Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles last summer. During a visit to Washington in the winter to renew his request for wildfire recovery aid, Newsom complained that the administration refused to grant a meeting.
Newsom was scheduled to be interviewed in Davos Wednesday evening by Fortune magazine at the USA House, a privately funded venue outside the forum that serves as a base for U.S. executives and officials. Venue backers include Microsoft and McKinsey, according to the Financial Times.
The U.S. State Department is an official partner of the venue, and multiple Trump administration officials have spoken there during the conference, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who on Wednesday slammed Newsom and his scheduled appearance, calling the governor “economically illiterate,” and saying “he’s not speaking” at the venue.
A spokesperson for the governor said USA House organizers told Newsom’s office Wednesday afternoon that they were cancelling the interview and barring Newsom from speaking with the press there. Newsom was instead invited to attend a reception later that night without the press, according to his office. He is still scheduled to speak with the news outlet Semafor at the official economic forum Thursday morning. 
On social media, Newsom accused the organizers of bowing to “pressure from the White House and State Department.” 
“How weak and pathetic do you have to be to be this scared of a fireside chat?” he wrote. 
Asked for comment, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly wrote in an email that “no one in Davos knows” who Newsom is, calling him a “third-rate governor” who was “frolicking around Switzerland instead of fixing the many problems he created in California.”
Fortune Media spokesperson Patrick Reilly confirmed the magazine’s staff invited Newsom to its event at the USA House, and did not make the decision to cancel his appearance. Reilly said the magazine schedules its speaking events independently, but “logistical, security, and other access considerations” often affect the lineup during prominent international events.
“USA House determined it would not be able to accommodate the governor’s participation and communicated that decision to Fortune,” Reilly wrote in an email. 
The governor has been using his trip to Davos to pitch California as a counterweight to Trump’s climate and economic policies. Earlier this week, Newsom announced the state has surpassed 2.5 million purchases of zero-emission electric vehicles, a market he has often said Trump is ceding to China by backing away from clean energy. 
On Tuesday he pressed European leaders to stand up to Trump as the president increasingly speaks of attempting to annex Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. On Wednesday during Trump’s own speech at the forum, the president mentioned Newsom by name. Newsom can be seen on video laughing and sighing as the president touted his aggressive immigration raids in blue states. 
“If I were a Democratic governor or whatever,” Trump said, “I would call up Trump, I’d say, ‘Come on in, make us look good.’”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/012126-Newsom-Davos-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-21 16:58:48.215646

(Photo by Marybeth Sandell)
As White House rhetoric escalates about taking Greenland by force or purchase, Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski suggests attention should focus more on the existing U.S. Arctic, where “we are woefully unprepared.”
Murkowski spoke with Arctic Today in Copenhagen as she traveled with an expanded bipartisan congressional delegation to reassure Danish and Greenlandic officials and business leaders that they’ll prevent Trump from taking hostile action against the Arctic nation.
Prior to the meeting, Trump said he wouldn’t rule out using military force to take control of Greenland and Secretary of State Rubio continues to assert that the U.S. aims to purchase Greenland. The administration claims it needs to control this territory for security and economic reasons.
Yet many observers argue that security concerns regarding Russia and China can best be addressed by boosting preparedness in its own backyard — the U.S. Arctic in Alaska. Murkowski agrees.
It’s incorrectly taken for granted that we’ve already got all we need, she said. Yet, “look at our icebreaker fleet, and you know that I say that mockingly, because we do not have a fleet. We have one icebreaker, and it’s down in Antarctica,” she said. “Reality is that we still do not have a deep water Arctic port.”
“Yes, I happen to think that we need to be focusing more” on the Alaskan coast, she said. “Russia is right there. Fifty-seven miles from mainland to mainland. We deal with air incursions, sometimes on a weekly basis. Russian bombers just come into our air space to show off a little bit.”


 Business risk


The delegation also met with Danish business leaders who invest in the U.S. Murkowski didn’t say which businesses she met specifically, but Danish companies with a large presence include pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk, brewer Carlsberg, shipper Maersk, renewable energy maker Vestas, and toymaker Lego.
Partnerships with, and investment from, Danish companies are at risk because of the increased rhetoric of acquiring Greenland, she said.
“People need to understand that there are consequences – economic consequences – to this,” she said. “We fray this alliance with Denmark because of the rhetoric.”
Murkowski said that Congressional concern over deteriorating relations with Greenland, Denmark and NATO is evident in the doubling of the size of the delegation from five to 10 members.
When the delegation returns home, raising awareness about the business risks is just one of the items on their action plan.
The plan also includes telling the story of the people of Greenland, specifically the anxiety and shock Greenlanders are feeling. Murkowski wants to raise awareness of what the people of Greenland are all about.
In the delegation’s closed-doors meetings, two of the young Greenland parliamentarians stressed that the concept of land ownership doesn’t exist in Greenland. The people don’t own the land, they use the land, and they give back to the land, she explained.
“And I was so moved, because it is every bit the same view as the native people in Alaska,” she said. “It’s across the region. It’s the subsistence connection. It is the cultural connection and the identity that you have with your land. And unfortunately, in the West, we have this idea that everything has to be monetized. You have to own something in order to control it. But that concept doesn’t even exist there.”
 Dialing down the rhetoric

Another task for the delegation is to “dial down the rhetoric.”
We must be “sensitive to the implications of the words that are being used. Words matter,” she said. “Any mother who’s ever raised sons knows that your words matter, so choose them carefully. And whether you’re the president of the United States, or whether you’re a nominee to be an ambassador, your words matter even more. And so think about the effect. Yeah. Right now, our NATO partners are rattled.”
Trump’s nomination for ambassador to Iceland, former U.S. Rep. Billy Long, told Arctic Today that he apologizes for comments he made Tuesday about making Iceland the 52nd state with himself as governor.
Murkowski meets with every ambassador nominee in the Arctic before voting on the nomination. She has not yet met with Long.
“Things are really tender right now,” she said. “Canadians are not going to think that something like that is funny. And I don’t think the people in Iceland would think that that is funny either.“
Thom Tillis, Senator for North Carolina, joined other delegates in trying to calm anxieties. He told Danes and Greenlanders watching Danish television to not worry. “This too shall pass,” he said. The television commentators hung on those words and discussed them further in the studio, asking each other how much that can be believed.
 Arctic focus

The White House is paying attention to the delegation’s visit, and to legislation submitted to block the administration from trying to take any NATO territory by force, Murkowski said.
“That’s a line that we just should not cross. If it were to come to that point, you would have the Congress firmly reject it,” she said, citing recent polling showing Americans have little interest in using military force to control Greenland. Seventy-one percent of all Americans believe taking Greenland by force is a bad idea, and just four percent think it is a good idea, according to a recent Reuters poll.
Greenland has dominated the Arctic conversation, leaving little room to discuss much else in recent months. Yet, when there is space for more, she is ready with her list of things the region needs to get back to discussing. Wildfires exposing the permafrost, greater economic cooperations, getting broadband or fiber access to remote areas, space and satellite observation are top of her mind.
“There’s so much that we can talk about as Arctic nations,” she said. But first the delegation will go home and raise awareness about the sentiment in Greenland. “They’re in fear, she said. “The children are afraid when they go to bed at night about what might happen while they sleep.”

Jan. 21, 2026. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Among the more than 500 new bills introduced in Nebraska’s 2026 legislative session were at least nine that seek to improve the state’s responses to domestic violence allegations.
The Nebraska Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence celebrated the introduction of these bills at a press conference in the Capitol rotunda Wednesday. Thirteen state senators, including introducers and supporters, attended, many wearing purple to signify support for domestic violence awareness.
Christon MacTaggart, the nonprofit’s executive director, said addressing domestic violence is a larger task than one bill can accomplish. She spoke on the need to fill existing gaps in services that have let some victims fall through the cracks.
The bills highlighted Wednesday would address a range of different areas related to domestic violence services. Some would increase penalties for domestic violence related charges, others are looking to improve reports of domestic abuse, and a few are focused on enforcement of existing laws.
“We know that domestic violence thrives in silence, and also in the gaps in how we respond,” MacTaggart said. “The legislation highlighted today will hopefully respond to the realities of what those victims are experiencing and address these gaps.”
Amy Cirian, domestic abuse death review team coordinator for the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, said there were 30 domestic abuse-related victim deaths in 2025 alone. From July 2022 to July 2025, seven children were killed as a result of a domestic homicide, and 49 children lost a parent to a domestic homicide.
Cirian said the cases are not only devastating to communities and children, they also strain some of Nebraska’s systems meant to respond to victims.
Legislative Bills 789 and 1059, both from State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, are aimed at closing “modern loopholes” domestic abusers are exploiting to reassert control over targets, Bosn said.
LB 789 would establish Nebraska’s version of the federal “forfeiture by wrongdoing” hearsay exception. Bosn said the bill is meant to ensure abusers cannot benefit from intimidating or silencing witnesses.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
LB 1059 would prohibit someone from knowingly using a mobile tracking device to monitor the location of a person or property. Bosn said such devices are a “growing tactic” used to control domestic violence survivors.
Bosn also introduced LB 1181, which wasn’t highlighted in the press conference but was praised in a press release from the Attorney General’s Office. The bill would expand a number of victims’ rights, including the definition of a homicide victim to include extended family members and others who suffer severe emotional harm because of the victim’s death.
Additionally, victims would have the right to read their written impact statements in court at the sentencing hearing. Currently, it is the court’s decision as to whether victims can read their written impact statement aloud, according to the press release.
“As a former prosecutor, this bill is a simple but meaningful step to ensure every victim is recognized and able to share their perspective,” Bosn said in the press release.
Attorney General Mike Hilgers said LB 1181 “emerged organically” as his office worked with Bosn to find ways to support victims through the judicial process. He said they identified that victims are not consistently allowed to read their written impact statements in court.
“First and foremost, we want victims to be heard. We’re always trying to get better about ways that we can improve the process for victims.” Hilgers said in the press release.
State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln introduced LB 1000, which would establish a scaled penalty structure for violating domestic abuse and sexual assault protection orders, increasing the penalty for third and fourth offenses.
“Protection orders are only as good as long as they’re followed,” Prokop said.
Other bills highlighted Wednesday included:

Legislative Bill 751, by State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha — Require a study to improve reporting and investigation of missing Black women and children.


Legislative Bill 753, by State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue — Allow military protective orders to be admissible as evidence in hearings on protection orders.


Legislative Bill 818, by State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman — Increase criminal penalties for various domestic assault offenses, and expand Nebraska’s existing domestic assault statutes.


Legislative Bill 825, by State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln — Require training on domestic abuse for mental health practitioners.


Legislative Bill 876, by State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse — Establish a process for law enforcement to initiate an immediate 72-hour protective order for victims of a domestic or sexual assault.


Legislative Bill 1131, by State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln — Establish tax credits for certain domestic violence service providers.

The Florida Board of Education during a meeting Wednesday at Tallahassee State College reviewed the report identifying the high-demand teacher needs areas. 
In 2024-2025, 11,994 special education courses were delivered by teachers not certified in that field, nearly 21% of such courses statewide. For English, the number of courses was 8,857, nearly 24% of such courses. For math, the number was 5,741, or 17% of all math courses.
More than 45,000 elementary education courses were taught in 2024-2025 by teachers not certified as elementary education teachers.
Board Chair Ryan Petty said the subjects in highest demand come as “no surprises.” He encouraged administrators to be more supportive of teachers in addressing student disciplinary problems, seconding the thoughts of a public commenter. Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas endorsed that and spotlighted the Teachers’ Bill of Rights. 
The Legislature passed the Teachers’ Bill of Rights in 2023, giving teachers the ability to establish classroom rules of conduct, remove from class violent and disrespectful students, and receive immediate assistance with uncontrollable students, among other rights.
The department points to teacher salary increase allocations; Florida Future Educators of America, a program educating students about the profession; the Great Florida Teach-In, a job fair hosted by the DOE; and HB 875 from 2025, a law addressing educator preparation courses, as recent measures to attract and retain teachers. 
The state is projecting nearly 2,000 vacant positions for special education in the 2026-2027 school year. Across all subjects, the state is projecting nearly 6,500 vacancies. The state projects 1,591 vacancies for elementary education certified teachers, the second-most. The third-most is math and English, each projected to have around 400 vacancies statewide, accounting for 6% each.
The state announced in July that teacher vacancies in the state were down 17.7% in advance of the 2025-2026 school year. The department did not provide the total number of teachers that percentage represents. 
The Florida Education Association issued a statement following the release of the report.
“We’ve reached out to the Florida Department of Education to request their vacancy data, and they still have yet to do so. The issue isn’t just the number of vacancies. It’s what these shortages mean for students and what our state’s leaders are going to do to fix the massive problem their own reports highlight.
“The state’s own reports show classrooms increasingly staffed by educators who are stretched thin, teaching out of field, or leaving the profession altogether, and it’s students — especially those with the greatest needs — that pay the price when positions go unfilled and experienced teachers are pushed out.
“The Legislature has proposed real solutions, such as allowing long-term contracts for qualified, high-quality educators and giving school districts more flexibility to pay teachers competitively, and the Governor has an opportunity to support them. Instead, the Board of Education and the Governor are more interested in ignoring the needs of educators while selling public schools to the highest billionaire bidder and shutting parents out of the conversation.
“Any progress on vacancies is welcome, but if even one student is left without a permanent, certified teacher, the problem isn’t fixed. The Legislature must ensure that every child, no matter their neighborhood or background, has consistent access to a qualified educator and a high-quality public education.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) A recent study prepared for the Iowa corn and ethanol industries predicts that without expanded markets, the “best days for corn growers are in the past.” 
The study, and industry advocates, said the passage of year-round E15, a 15% ethanol ratio blend of fuel, will provide relief to farmers in the short term, but access to ultra-low carbon ethanol fuels will be necessary to sustain corn growers past 2030. 
The study follows what the U.S. Department of Agriculture called a record year of corn production, with Iowa farmers growing 2.77 billion bushels of corn in 2025. 
In a call with reporters Wednesday, Iowa corn and ethanol leaders, referencing the study conducted by Decision Innovation Solutions, said the demand gap – or the distance between total corn use and total corn production – will continue to increase. A bigger demand gap means lower corn prices, assuming 2025 corn acreage figures persist, which would make it harder for farmers to stay in business. 
The Decision Innovation Solutions study was “prepared for” Iowa Corn Growers Association and the Iowa Renewable Fuel Association, according to the report.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Mark Mueller, Iowa Corn Growers Association president and a farmer near Waverly, said farmers are already working on “very very tight margins.” 
“I am a fourth-generation farmer, and I am nervous that there won’t be a fifth generation Mueller farming on my family land,” Mueller said. “…The bottom line is that we have high input prices, we have low commodity prices, and we’re producing more corn all the time. We need more places to move our corn, and while Iowa corn is working towards that, it’s just a tough, tough road for the farming community.” 
The study examined several potential trajectories for corn and ethanol industries. First, if production trends continue to increase, corn acreage planted remains at 2025 levels and ethanol demand is not increased by the nationwide, year-round sale of E15 fuel, the demand gap “rises sharply.” 
Monte Shaw, the executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said this option puts the farm economy into a “capital C crisis” where farmers would be asking taxpayers for tens of billions of dollars in farm support payments. 
If Congress is able to pass a bill permitting the year-round sale of 15% ethanol blends at gas stations nationwide, the study shows it would increase corn demand by about 2.1 billion bushels by 2031. 
According to the study, the expanded ethanol market with E15 fuels would cause the demand gap to diminish, reaching almost zero by 2030. The electrification and improved fuel efficiency of vehicles, combined with farmers’ anticipated increases in production, would cause the gap to again increase after 2031. 
Shaw said he hopes nationwide, year-round E15 can be included one of the final spending bills Congress has to pass this year. 
“I think that’s going to be the single most important ag-policy decision that’s made this decade,” Shaw said. “It literally sets us up to move forward or to go into a very bad place.” 
Dave Miller, chief economist with Decision Innovation Solutions, said ethanol production will have to turn to marine and aviation markets as the industries begin to transition away from fossil fuels. 
“E15 is not a sufficient long-term solution,” Miller said. “It is a near-term solution that is very powerful, but in the long run, we need to be able to take, and access, two great big markets that exist.” 
Ethanol and corn industry leaders say the best way for them to enter the ultra-low carbon ethanol market, which is the type of fuel the marine and aviation industries seek, is to obtain access to carbon capture and sequestration technologies. 
Several companies have attempted to build carbon sequestration pipelines through Iowa to connect to ethanol plants for this purpose over the past several years. The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline obtained a permit from the state regulating board, but the progress of the pipeline has been tied up in legal and legislative fights. 
Environmental groups like the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter and groups of landowners argue the transportation of sequestered carbon dioxide is not a public use, and therefore that the pipeline should not be able to use eminent domain to obtain rights-of-way.
The House is scheduled to debate a bill Wednesday that would ban the use of eminent domain for carbon capture pipelines, and Summit says, would kill the project. A bill in the Senate seeks to address the issue by allowing pipeline operators to deviate from their approved paths in favor of landowners who are willing to have the pipeline on their properties. 
Shaw said this is the second battle the ethanol and corn industries have to fight. 
“Right now there are people who are trying to slam the door on the future markets of Iowa agriculture, and we’re trying hard to say, no, let’s not do that,” Shaw said.
According to the study, the ultra-low carbon ethanol markets are large enough to sustain continued growth in corn production. Per the study, the marine fuel market represents a 70-80 billion gallon per-year fuel market and sustainable aviation fuel has the potential for 35 billion gallons per year. 
“Not all these fuel requirements will be filled with ultra-low carbon ethanol,” the study said. “But these new markets are sufficiently large to close the gap on corn demand through 2050, if only we have the foresight to do so.”

(Photo by Michael Conroy/The Associated Press)Florida’s notoriously challenging unemployment insurance program may become even more difficult for individuals to navigate if legislation that advanced Wednesday in a Senate committee becomes law.
The state’s benefits remain among the lowest in the country — the maximum weekly payout is $275 and its duration is capped at 12 weeks (most states average between 24 and 26 weeks). If the unemployment rate rises above 5%, extensions can go up to 23 weeks.
Now comes the “Promoting Work, Deterring Fraud Act of 2026” (SB 216)  sponsored by Sen. Stan McClain, R-Ocala.
The measure would require the Department of Commerce to disqualify individuals claiming unemployment insurance benefits if it finds that the individual failed:

Without good cause to contact the required number of prospective employers per week.
To appear on three or more occasions for a scheduled job interview without notifying the prospective employer of the need to cancel or reschedule.
Return to employment when recalled to work after a temporary layoff.

Additionally, the department would need to verify every two weeks that claimants are living, not incarcerated, and not employed.
Existing state law requires those on unemployment to contact five prospective employers for each week of a claim. In small counties, a claimant must contact at least three prospective employers for each week.
McClain introduced the legislation to the Senate Appropriations Committee on Transportation, Tourism, and Economic Development by saying that there are somewhere between 450,000 and 460,000 job openings in Florida and about 30,000 individuals receiving unemployment benefits.
He said the measure would help crack down on fraud in the system. Over the past two legislative sessions, advocates for this legislation have asserted that, since 2021, the department had prevented $32 billion in attempted fraud, although no such report has ever been made public.
When challenged about that statistic by Democratic Sen. Tina Polsky of Boca Raton, McClaim acknowledged, “It has not personally been verified to me by the department.”
“No report exists,” declared Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando. “I asked for the report as it was presented to us in the last committee. No reports exists. It is a talking point.”
The department did not respond to a request by the Phoenix for documentation verifying that assertion.
During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Florida’s unemployment system experience a massive breakdown, leaving hundreds of thousands of people who’d lost work unable to collect benefits after the state’s old CONNECT unemployment website collapsed.
Rich Templin, director for politics and public policy for the Florida AFL-CIO, said Wednesday that he and other advocates had warned lawmakers about the fallout from a mass layoff event, when he said the unemployment insurance system had been “essentially gutted by then Gov. Rick Scott.”
“Of every 100 people apply, only 9 to 10 actually receive benefits, because of all the barriers we’ve put up in the river to keep them from getting there,” he said.
Richard Jones is secretary-treasurer for the Florida Building Trades State Council and a member of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades. He said Florida’s economic growth depends on construction workers to build schools, hospitals, and high-rises that keep the state running.
But he added that construction is also the most “cyclical” industry in the state, and that the proposed legislation would make it easier to deny workers benefits they’ve earned.
He questioned the provision in the bill that would disqualify an applicant if he or she misses three job interviews without notice over one year.
“In the building trades, hiring doesn’t happen through online interviews,” Jones said. “It happens through dispatch halls, project-by-project calls, and referrals from signatory contractors. Jobs often come fast, sometimes the same day. Our members are not sitting around ignoring interviews. They’re waiting for skilled, trade-specific work that matches their certifications, their training, and the safety standards we enforce.”
The bill would require the department to investigate new claims with information duplicative of existing claims; scrutinize claims filed from foreign IP addresses before paying any benefits; share claim information with specified state and federal agencies; maintain a web page for reporting violations of reemployment assistance laws; and publish a yearly report.
The GOP-controlled committee approved the bill on a strict party-line vote. Every Democratic senator commented about why they opposed the legislation, while no Republicans (other than McClain) discussed why he or she supported it.
Quoting Ron DeSantis’ comments from 2020 that the state’s unemployment system had “pointless roadblocks,”  Sen. LaVon Bracy-Davis, D-Ocoee, asked simply, “Why are we creating more?”
Sen. Polsky referred to the focus the Legislature has this session on AI, and said that one of the expected fallouts from that advanced technology will be loss of employment among certain white-collar workers.
“We’re going to be facing a deluge of people losing their jobs and we’re only setting the system up to fail and making it even harder for these people,” she said.
The bill has one more committee stop before hitting the Senate floor. Its companion in the House (HB 191), sponsored by Rep. Shane Abbott, R- DeFuniak Springs, has already been approved by the two committees and is awaiting a final vote in that chamber.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NCSL-labor-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-21 16:58:48.215646
,DC,2026-01-21 21:10:26+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Even conservative Supreme Court justices cool to Trump dismissal of the Fed’s Lisa Cook,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/even-conservative-supreme-court-justices-cool-trump-dismissal-feds-lisa-cook,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Supreme Court justices across the political spectrum appeared skeptical of President Donald Trump’s swift, informal dismissal of Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, and his effort to influence the independent central bank that governs monetary policy in the United States.The oral arguments Wednesday drew a high-profile appearance in the courtroom of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell — now a target of a Department of Justice investigation. For months prior to the federal probe, Trump has threatened to fire Powell if the chair did not quickly lower interest rates.For two hours, the justices heard arguments over whether Cook could remain on the board, as a lower court ruled, while litigation continues examining if Trump violated a “for cause” removal statute when he fired her over social media in late August. Trump alleged in an Aug. 25 letter posted to his Truth Social platform that Cook committed financial fraud by lying on mortgage loan documents. Trump declared he had “sufficient cause” to remove Cook based on alleged “deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter.”Under the Federal Reserve Act, the president can only remove board governors “for cause” — as designed by Congress in an effort to preserve the central bank’s independence. Trump claims his removals of members of independent government agencies are not reviewable by the courts.Cook has denied any wrongdoing and challenged the president, the board and Powell, essentially arguing in court that an “unsubstantiated allegation about private mortgage applications,” submitted prior to her Senate confirmation, does not amount to cause for removal. Cook also argued that Trump denied her due process in not giving her notice or a chance to respond to his allegations.Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, has continued to perform her board duties, without interference from Powell.Alito questions ‘hurried manner’ of firingDuring lengthy questioning of U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer, Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson asked what the risk would be in allowing Cook to remain in her job while the administration made its case to the lower courts.“The question is: What is the harm of allowing that injunction to remain, because she's in office now and would just continue?” Brown asked.Sauer, Trump’s former personal defense lawyer, said the administration asserts ""grievous, irreparable injury to the public perception, to the Federal Reserve, of allowing her to stay in office.”“Do you have evidence related to the public perception, or is this just the president's view?” Jackson, a Biden appointee, pressed back.Sauer said the evidence regarding Cook’s two separate mortgage applications was contained in Trump’s “dismissal order,” referring to the letter posted on social media. Moments later, Brown asked if Cook was “given the opportunity in some sort of formal proceeding to contest that evidence or explain it?”“Not a formal proceeding. She was given an opportunity in public,” Sauer said.“In the world? Like she was supposed to post about it, and that was the opportunity to be heard that you're saying was afforded to her?” Brown asked.“Yes,” Sauer replied.Justice Samuel Alito, one of the high court’s most conservative members, asked Sauer why the removal had to be handled “in such a hurried manner.”“You began by laying out what you claim to be the factual basis for the for-cause removal, but no court has ever explored those facts. Are the mortgage applications even in the record in this case?” asked Alito, who was appointed to the court under President George W. Bush.“I know that the text of the social media post that screenshots the mortgage applications is in the record. I don't recall if the paperwork itself was in the record,” Sauer said.Federal Reserve independenceOver several minutes of back-and-forth, Justice Brett Kavanaugh pressed Sauer on the importance of the Federal Reserve’s independence.“Let's talk about the real world downstream effects of this. Because if this were set as a precedent, it seems to me — just thinking big picture, what goes around, comes around — all the current president's appointees would likely be removed for cause on Jan. 20, 2029, if there's a Democratic president, or Jan. 20, 2033,” argued Kavanaugh, who was appointed during Trump’s first term.“We're really at, at will removal. So what are we doing here?” he asked.“I can't predict what future presidents may or may not do,” Sauer replied.“Well, history is a pretty good guide. Once these tools are unleashed, they are used by both sides, and usually more the second time around,” Kavanaugh said.Kavanaugh later challenged Cook’s lawyer, Paul Clement, over whether his argument was “tilting the balance too far the other direction from where the solicitor general is.”Clement responded, “This is a situation where Congress, political animals, one and all, knew better than anyone that the short-term temptations to lower interest rates and have easy money was a disaster in the long term, but was going to be irresistible. “And so they tied their own hands by taking the Fed out of the appropriations process, and they tied the president's hands,” the Alexandria, Virginia-based attorney said. In a statement following arguments, Cook said the case is “about whether the Federal Reserve will set key interest rates guided by evidence and independent judgment or will succumb to political pressure.”“Research and experience show that Federal Reserve independence is essential to fulfilling the congressional mandate of price stability and maximum employment. That is why Congress chose to insulate the Federal Reserve from political threats, while holding it accountable for delivering on that mandate. For as long as I serve at the Federal Reserve, I will uphold the principle of political independence in service to the American people,” Cook continued in the statement.Regulating interest rates — to cool inflation or stimulate the economy — is one tool the central bank uses to accomplish its dual mandate on employment and price stability.Subpoena issuedThe arguments occurred just a dozen days after Powell received a federal grand jury subpoena as part of a Department of Justice probe into allegations that he lied to Congress about multi-year renovation costs to the central bank’s District of Columbia headquarters.The revelation of a federal investigation of Powell ignited sharp criticism, even from some Republicans. Powell alleged in a rare video statement that the administration’s “unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.”He continued, “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.”Trump first nominated Powell in 2017 to head the Federal Reserve, for a four-year term that began in February 2018. Biden reappointed him in 2021, and Powell received overwhelming support in an 80-19 Senate confirmation vote.Wednesday’s arguments also came less than two months after the Supreme Court heard arguments in Trump’s firing of another member of an independent federal agency, Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter.",,,,2026-01-21 16:58:48.215646

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)An affordable housing project for veterans nearing completion in Fayetteville could become a national model, elected officials said Wednesday.
Located on a previously vacant 3-acre parking lot near the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks, Patriot Park is a 63-unit apartment complex supported through the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program that will provide housing to veterans. 
The project is a public-private partnership with Washington County leasing the land to Strategic Realty, which is owned by Republican state Sen. Jim Petty of Van Buren. Strategic Realty is also involved in affordable housing projects serving low-income Fayetteville residents and Bentonville Public School District employees.
Northwest Arkansas organizations celebrate new affordable housing development

Following a tour of the Patriot Park construction site Wednesday, Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman, a ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies, praised officials for “thinking outside the box” to provide housing to veterans.
“It’s not only going to help the veterans in the area, but I think it’s a plan — because it is unique, it works — that will spread throughout the country,” Boozman said. “And as a result…[there are] a lot of veterans that are going to be in a safe place that they can enjoy and afford. That’s really what it’s about is affordability.”
Northwest Arkansas has struggled with affordability in recent years as the region’s rapidly expanding population increased home costs.  The region’s growth can be attributed to a variety of factors, including economic development opportunities and a lower cost of living attracting out-of-state residents to Arkansas during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Local organizations and officials have sought solutions through various initiatives like a workforce housing center and a timber-focused facility where University of Arkansas students explore affordable housing solutions.
Patriot Park has been a years-long project that was delayed when construction prices skyrocketed during the pandemic and created a funding gap, Washington County Judge Patrick Deakins said. 
The goal is to complete construction this spring on the project, which will include commercial space and meeting rooms that can contribute to a sense of community, Deakins said. 
“One of the things they primarily miss is that camaraderie, that brotherhood they experienced within the armed forces no matter what that was,” he said. “We think we can kind of recreate, synthesize that environment here.”

The county has received inquiries about Patriot Park from around the country, and while veterans will be given priority, Deakins said he doesn’t want apartments to sit empty, so other community members may be eligible to live in the low-income housing complex as well. 
There’s a lot of need for housing in Fayetteville for many people, but especially veterans who are often injured or partially disabled and on a fixed income, Deakins said. 
“They need the predictability of this apartment,” he said. “They need to know that in three years the rent’s not going to go up 200%…that’s what this is going to give them. To take that one level of stress off their housing of that veteran, to know that they’re going to be fine, safe, warm.”

Laura Chapman, R-Ohio, speaks on the Senate floor in Charleston, West Virginia on Wednesday, Jan. 21, 2026. (Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)After the House of Delegates fast-tracked emergency funding for Hancock County Schools, the bill is now held up in the Senate, prompting questions from a Republican Senator who represents the district. 
“These bills would provide an $8 million loan — and I want to emphasize loan — so that Hancock County teachers, bus drivers and cooks could be paid,” Sen. Laura Chapman, R-Hancock, said on the Senate floor Wednesday morning. “This is outrageous.”
But other Senators said payroll is already secured for next month and that caution is needed as lawmakers figure out how to deal with multiple financially-distressed school districts in West Virginia. 
Sen. Ryan Weld, R-Brooke
“This problem is going to require a long term solution and fixes that are going to go much broader than just Hancock County, because there are a lot of counties in the state that are under financial strain,” said Sen. Ryan Weld, R-Brooke, who also represents Hancock County.
The state school board intervened in Hancock County last week, terminating the superintendent and appointing a replacement due to school districts’ financial crisis that threatened pay for teachers and staff. 
Hancock County Schools has been operating with 143 more positions than what the county school aid formula called for, according to the state education department. Along with a $5 million cash shortfall, there are numerous ongoing construction projects, including a $1 million turf project.
State education officials said the district’s financial officer, who was terminated earlier this month, intentionally hid the budget issues in the state’s online education database system. 
House Majority Leader Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock, introduced a pair of bills on Monday aimed at helping the county make payroll. House Bill 4574 would create a condition-based emergency fund for financially distressed counties; House Bill 4575 would give $8 million to the state education department for Hancock County so that the school district can pay its employees.
The House that same day suspended constitutional rules to pass both bills and sent them to the Senate. The bills have been referred to two Senate committees and have not yet been taken up for consideration.
Chapman told Senate members that they’d suspended constitutional rules in the past for other bills.
“These actions show the public exactly where our priorities lie,” she said. “Do we expect our teachers and staff to show up to work when they won’t receive a paycheck? What about the children when schools are closed for lack of staff? The Hancock County teachers and staff did nothing wrong. They were not a part of the administration decisions.”
Weld said there wasn’t a need for the Senate to immediately take up the bills because the payroll emergency passed once the state school board intervened.
“There will not be a day without school because of no money or nobody receiving a paycheck,” he said. “The state, through the Board of Education, is going to front June’s state aid formula money and that will be used to make February payroll.” Weld said that in February, the state will make decisions about whether Hancock County Schools need additional funds to make future payrolls. 
Sen. Jason Barrett, R-Berkeley
Senate Finance Chair Jason Barrett told MetroNews Talkline that there was a need for immediate financial support in Hancock County.  
“I think it is important that the teachers, the school service personnel, those in Hancock County know that the payroll is going to be met; they are going to be paid,” Barrett said. 
The Senate, according to Weld, will use the emergency school fund bill or another piece of legislation to set up more accountability for public school finances. 
“For the past three years, Hancock County schools have received a clean audit … How did that happen? Are we not looking at the right numbers?” Weld questioned. He said members want to make sure this financial situation doesn’t happen “again and again and again” in other school systems. 
Sen. Mike Woelfel, D-Cabell
Americans for Prosperity-West Virginia, a right-wing think tank, has urged lawmakers to oppose the emergency funding for financially distressed counties. The group called the bill misguided and fiscally irresponsible.
“The legislation was sold as a remedy to a single instance, in which the Hancock County school system is currently unable to meet its obligations, but will quickly serve as a way for bad actors to engage in more bad behavior,” they wrote in a statement Tuesday. 
On the Senate floor, Minority Leader Mike Woelfel commended Senate President Randy Smith for using due caution to examine the bills that were passed so quickly by the House.
“With local control comes local accountability,” said Woelfel, D-Cabell. “I’m not necessarily at all opposed to what the Senator is advocating, but in this case, we’re going to take our time thanks to your leadership, and we’re going to do it right.”
Woelfel said that Hancock County’s prosecuting attorney will conduct an investigation into whether or not there was any criminal wrongdoing in the school’s financial debacle.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)With WisconsinEye, the state government video streaming service, still offline, the state Senate is planning to livestream its floor session Wednesday when it votes on constitutional amendment proposals as well as bills related to income tax breaks and education. 
According to a Friday memo from the office of Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg), the Senate Committee on Organization approved a livestream that will be facilitated by the Legislative Technology Services Bureau.
The memo states the goal of the stream is to enhance transparency and public availability, and that any use or distribution of the livestream is prohibited. Wednesday will be the first time since WisconsinEye went offline that the full Senate will meet to vote on legislation.
The absence of WisconsinEye, which halted coverage in December due to financial difficulties, means that for the first time since 2007 no organization is livestreaming and archiving meetings in the Legislature. Since Tuesday morning, WisconsinEye has raised more than $40,000 towards the $250,000 goal of  its GoFundMe campaign to cover three months of operating expenses. 
After WisconsinEye ceased coverage, Republicans began enforcing rules banning members of the public from recording committee proceedings. Democrats have criticized that move, saying the Legislature needs to be more transparent. One Republican committee chair told the Examiner that the enforcement of recording rules was in part due to concerns over the use of recordings for political purposes.
The state Assembly has met three times this year, including Tuesday, without sessions being livestreamed. It also has another floor session scheduled for Thursday. 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said during a press conference that the presence of journalists at the floor session is why the Assembly is not doing something similar to the Senate in the absence of WisconsinEye. He said he didn’t see the need to try to recreate the service.
“People are reporting on [the floor session]. We are still trying to figure out if there’s a way for us to get WisconsinEye — we’ve had good meetings,” Vos said, adding that he has met with Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) and Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) on the issue. “I think, in the end, we’ll find some kind of an answer.”

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)New Mexico lawmakers on Wednesday welcomed what they said was the largest delegation of Mexican officials to ever visit the Roundhouse, with Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) pledging continued cooperation with the state’s neighboring country.
“We share history, we share values, we share customs, we share a commitment to making life better for every single person,” Martínez said. “No matter how divisive the federal administration might be right now, no matter how dark some of these times are for our communities, New Mexico will continue to stand strong in our commitment, in our ally, in our connection to our brothers and sisters south of the border.”

Standing before the New Mexico, U.S. and Mexico national flags, several lawmakers welcomed the more than one dozen delegates from Mexico, which included state representatives, mayors and other delegates from the states of Chihuahua, Sonora and Nuevo León — as well as federal diplomats.
After remarks, Juárez-based Juan Gabriel impersonator Hugo Cortés and wife Lily Cortés serenaded the crowd with a rendition of “Qué Bonito Es Santa Fe.”
Despite continued uncertainty from the Trump Administration’s tariff policies, talks between New Mexico and the states of Sonora and Chihuahua on trade are ongoing, Patricia Pinzón, who serves as the Consul of Mexico in Albuquerque, told Source NM in an interview after the event.
“Conversations have not stopped, they have only increased,” she said. “Once more, we are so thankful to be in an immigrant collaborative, cooperative state such as this.”
Gerardo Fierro, the executive director of the state’s Border Authority, said he expects continued investment at the state’s border regions and crossings, noting that New Mexico’s exports increased from $7 billion to $10 billion in trade with Mexico.

“Mexico is the number one trading partner with the U.S., but it is also the number one trading partner for New Mexico,” he said. “We’re looking to make strategic investments at the border to bring more companies there.”
He also said the delegation would hold discussions with state lawmakers on the continued impact of the New World screwworm, a remergent parasitic worm which has shut down cattle trade between the U.S. and Mexico.
“It’s affecting jobs across the U.S., with jobs on the feed lots and meat factories being lost, because we are no longer having cattle that used to be fed in New Mexico and Texas,” he said. “It’s imperative that both federal governments start resolving these issues.”

Three of her bills cleared a House committee Jan. 21, 2026. (Courtesy NM Legislature)A New Mexico House committee on Wednesday approved nine bills seeking to authorize the state’s entry into various health care licensure compacts, part of a bipartisan effort to increase pressure on Senate Democrats to approve more than just two such agreements this session.
Interstate licensure compacts make relocation easier for health care and other types of workers licensed in other states, according to doctors and advocates. But New Mexico, unlike most other jurisdictions nationwide and its neighboring states, is a member of only one such medical compact.
Amid a statewide health care worker shortage, a group of six lawmakers from both parties and legislative chambers met repeatedly starting in November and announced agreement on legislation joining two such compacts: one for physicians and another for social workers.
But many lawmakers, including House Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate, say two compacts is not enough. So they introduced more than a dozen bills for other compacts, including for paramedics, dentists, physical therapists, counselors and others.
New Mexico Senate majority leader says medical compact legislation ‘close’ ahead of session

Republicans in both chambers during opening-day news conferences touted the compacts as a way to bring in health care workers and increase patient access, particularly in rural areas, to telehealth services. 
“There’s absolutely no excuse why we can’t enter all of these compacts,” said Sen. Nicole Tobiassen (R-Albuquerque) during a news conference Tuesday. “It’s in the best interest of every New Mexican.”
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has called on the Legislature, including in her State of the State address on Tuesday, to pass multiple medical compacts, and provided a legislative message this week that authorizes the Legislature to consider non-budget-related bills. 
Democratic leaders in the Senate have opposed entering more than two compacts during the session, saying doing so will overburden the state Regulation and Licensing Division and would risk rushing the state into complicated, important agreements. They’ve also previously opposed joining due to concerns about liability and how the compacts might undermine state laws.
During Wednesday’s meeting of the House Health and Human Services Committee, sponsors and bill supporters described worker shortages in a variety of fields — gaps they hope the compacts will help fill. 
New Mexico poised to enter physician medical compact — one lawmaker says that’s not enough

Rep. Marian Matthews (D-Albuquerque) is sponsoring three compact bills for psychologists, paramedics and counselors. She said New Mexico’s entry will have immediate benefits for the provision of telemedicine, particularly for specialized areas of care.
“It basically makes the practice of medicine kind of nationwide, instead of just each little state having only the resources that are in that state,” she said. “And I think that’s why the access grows exponentially.”
Fred Nathan, director of Think New Mexico, a nonpartisan advocacy group in favor of the compacts, said during the meeting that joining the compacts is the “single most important and impactful thing the Legislature and the governor can do this session to improve access to care for all New Mexicans.”
“There are more compacts than just the doctors’ compact. We have shortages in every area,” he said, including shortages of emergency medical technicians. A 2024 study from the University of New Mexico found the state is about 2,500 EMTs below national benchmarks based on county populations and numbers of patients.  
According to one state official, refusing to join the compacts could carry significant financial impacts. Keenan Ryan, acting chief medical officer at the state Health Care Authority, noted that the state recently received more than $210 million from the federal government for a rural health care grant program. In the application, federal officials asked the state to explain its plans to join medical compacts.
State officials wrote in their application that they intend to push the Legislature to pursue compact approval for doctors, emergency medical service providers, psychologists and physicians’ assistants during the session.
“Stipulations in this grant require that if these compacts don’t get passed, we are subject to potential clawbacks from the federal government,” Ryan said. “So there is real funding opportunity losses if these compacts are not passed, especially for rural New Mexico.”
Of 11 compacts on the agenda, lawmakers on the committee passed nine. Rep. Gail Armstrong (R-Magdalena) withdrew her two compact bills dentists and physicians’ assistants without explanation. 
The bills that passed Wednesday will be heard next in the House Judiciary Committee.

(Photo by Alexis Bonogofsky/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)The caribou herd that is at the center of the debate over oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has declined by about a third over the past eight years, according to state biologists.
The Porcupine Caribou Herd, which ranges in territory that spans the Alaska-Yukon border, is now estimated at 143,00 animals, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. That compares to the all-time high for the herd of 218,000 animals, estimated in 2017.
The new total is based on a photocensus completed in July. The work, which uses analysis of aerial photographs to estimate population sizes, is the first completed for the Porcupine herd since the all-time high was recorded in 2017.
Despite its decline, the Porcupine herd maintains its relatively new status as Alaska’s largest caribou herd. The Western Arctic Caribou Herd, which peaked in 2003 at 490,000 animals, is now down to 121,000, according to the latest estimate. While the Porcupine herd has declined  by about a third since 2017, it fared better than the Western Arctic herd, which declined by more than half in that same period.
The Porcupine herd has likely been declining for several years, but weather problems and other logistical challenges in the animals’ remote territory precluded completion of a new photocensus until last summer, said Mark Nelson, an Alaska Department of Fish and Game biologist based in Fairbanks.
The decline is not surprising, Nelson said. The new population estimate falls within the herd’s cyclical pattern over the past decades, he said. “If you look back in time, this decline right now is exactly what you would expect would happen about now,” Nelson said.
In 1979, the herd was around 106,000 caribou. It grew to 178,000 in 1989, declined to 123,000 in 2001, and then increased to 218,000 in 2017.
Named for the Porcupine River, a tributary of the Yukon River, the herd is comanaged by governments on both sides of the border and the subject of a U.S.-Canada treaty. Nelson is a member of a technical committee that operates under the treaty.
The debate over oil development in the refuge coastal plain — generally the region the herd uses to give birth to calves — has split governments involved in the treaty. While state political leaders in Alaska and the federal government under the Trump administration are pushing for leasing and drilling, the federal, territorial and tribal governments in Canada have been staunch opponents.
The debate has split Indigenous groups in the region as well, with North Slope Inupiat organizations supporting oil development because of potential economic benefits and Gwich’in Athabascans in Alaska and Canada opposing it because of potential damage to the Porcupine herd and the general environment. Some of those groups have sued to block leasing, and last week amended complaints were filed in three of the cases challenging oil development.
Indigenous opponents of oil development said the new caribou population estimate shows the urgency of their cause.
“Decline of the Porcupine Caribou Herd highlights the need for greater habitat protection,” said the headline of a Jan. 7 news release issued by the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation of Canada.
The decline “does not, in itself, constitute a crisis,” but it shows the importance of intact habitat, the release said. “For this reason, VGFN strongly condemns decisions by the Trump Administration to open the entire Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, the critical calving grounds of the Porcupine Caribou Herd, to drilling.”
Inupiat groups, however, contend that oil development would not harm the Arctic environment. Among them is Voice of Arctic Iñupiat, or VOICE, a nonprofit organization of local and regional governments, Native corporations and other entities. “We understand that responsible onshore development and our cultural traditions can coexist, as they have done for more than 50 years,” Nagruk Harcharek, president of VOICE, said in a Dec. 12 statement supporting action by Congress and the Trump administration that paved the way for oil leasing.
Possible food limitations
The reason for the Porcupine herd’s decline has not been identified.

	Nelson said there is no indication that hunting pressure is a problem for the herd. While the hunt is very important to communities like Arctic Village in northeastern Alaska, the herd’s range is very remote, making it difficult for non-local hunters to access, he said.
The herd’s size remains well above any threshold that would trigger limits on Indigenous hunting, according to the Porcupine Caribou Management Board, a Canadian advisory panel with representatives from the First Nations, territorial and federal governments. The board is set to hold its annual harvest meeting on Feb. 11 and 12 in Inuvik, Northwest Territories.
Nelson said a possible reason for the decline is a limit on available food that followed the herd’s growth to the all-time population high.
Some evidence supporting that theory could be in the herd’s reproductive pattern. It takes a lot of food to give an adult female caribou the energy and strength to give birth to calves, and the birth rate has fallen among younger adult females in the Porcupine herd, Nelson said.
Meanwhile, wildfire patterns could have reduced available food, he said.
The Porcupine herd’s range is a region where wildfires are common and part of the normal forest cycle, but there is a long-term trend of more frequent and intense wildfires that are burning more deeply into the ground. That means lichen and other tundra plants that are prime caribou food may be in shorter supply, Nelson said.
“It takes a long time for that stuff to come back,” he said. “And sometimes it doesn’t come back as lichen, like it was before.” Sometimes what grows are plants like shrubs that are “kind of caribou food, but it’s not like their main ideal kind of food.”
More than a decade ago, scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey and University of Alaska Fairbanks projected that increasing wildfires in the Alaska-Yukon border region, driven by climate change, could significantly diminish lichen habitat used by the caribou there. The Porcupine herd could lose about a fifth of its winter lichen habitat by the end of the century, according to that study, published in 2014.
Elsewhere on the North Slope, another caribou herd has declined, according to an Alaska Department of Fish and Game photocensus also completed in July.
The Central Arctic herd is now estimated to have 26,600 caribou, down from the 34,600 estimate that resulted from the previous photocensus, which was conducted in 2022, according to the department. The Central Arctic herd peaked in 2010 at 68,400 caribou, but it declined to 22,600 in 2016, according to the department.
The department’s goal is to maintain a t herd size between 28,000 to 32,000 caribou, Nelson said. “Over the last 10 years, it’s basically kind of bounced up and down around our management objective there. Now it’s just a little bit below,” he said.
A new population estimate is not available for another North Slope herd.
Efforts to complete a photocensus of the Teshekpuk caribou herd were hampered by bad weather, said Joelle Hepler, a Department of Fish and Game wildlife biologist. The most recent Teshekpuk abundance estimate is from 2022 and stands at 61,593 animals, she said.
A few years ago, the Teshekpuk herd, known for spending the entire year on the North Slope rather than migrating south in winter, and the Porcupine herd were only two North American major tundra-dwelling herds at or near their population peaks.
Throughout the Arctic, caribou and reindeer populations declined by 65 percent in the past two to three decades, a trend likely driven by climate change and habitat loss, according to the 2024 Arctic Report Card released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Two state senators and a former lawmaker filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against an omnibus piece of legislation that made broad changes to property tax law, alleging it doesn’t adhere to the state constitution.
The lawsuit, filed against the state and the state’s Department of Revenue, alleges Rep. Llew Jones, a Conrad Republican, orchestrated an effort to gut the original intention of Senate Bill 542 and replaced it with “controversial” legislation through amendments and misled the public while he did it. 
Sen. Greg Hertz, Sen. Tom McGillvray and former legislator Keith Regier jointly filed the lawsuit. Jones did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The original goal of the property tax legislation discussion was to figure out a way to lower property taxes for Montanans. Numerous bills were discussed, ranging from so-called “Homestead exemptions” to  a simple freeze to more rebates. One of the popular fixes supported pushing the tax burden onto out-of-state residents who own homes in Montana.
Regier, who is the father of Senate President Matt Regier, said the opposite has happened.
“Instead, they’ve accelerated the land grab by significantly raising taxes on multigenerational properties that will force Montanans to sell their family legacy property to someone with the financial means to pay the tax bill,” Regier said.
Montana Governor Greg Gianforte supported the Homestead Tax exemption and his office indicated support for the legislation on Wednesday.
“While the governor’s office doesn’t generally comment on litigation, the governor is proud to have signed the only two property tax bills into law that reached his desk, cutting property taxes for 80% of Montana homeowners,” Sean Southard, the Governor’s communication director said in a statement. “If Senate Bill 542 is struck down, property taxes for Montana homeowners will increase significantly, reversing the relief that 80% of homeowners received.” 
SB 542 has three parts — a $90 million tax rebate, a permanent restructuring of property tax rates, and, last, a fix to the so-called “Billings problem.” That fix essentially pushed state funds to cities whose charters ran afoul with the changes around mill levies.
Cities with a charter that has specific stipulations around how many mills they can levy without voter approval could have lost millions if the state reimbursement wasn’t added. The suit calls that “vote buying.”
“Individual homeowners received rebates, favored property classes received rate reductions, and charter cities received revenue protection,” the lawsuit reads. “Each piece targeted a different constituency, and each required bundling to secure sufficient votes for passage.”
McGillvray, the senate majority leader, called it “ Washington D.C.-style corruption.”
“Montanans pride ourselves that our Legislature debates each policy idea on its own merits, with genuine public participation,” McGillvray said in a statement. “We’re not Washington, D.C., where massive bills get cobbled together behind closed doors and shoved down legislators’ throats as ‘must pass’ legislation.”
 ‘The cost of doing business’ 

The suit says that 10 days before SB 542 had a hearing in the Senate’s Taxation committee, Rep. Jones had already decided to gut the original bill, which was originally a three-page bill that froze property taxes for two years. By the end, it was a 40-page behemoth, which some legislators took to calling “Frankenstein”,  and included none of the original wording of SB 542 as introduced by Sen. Wylie Galt.
“At that hearing, neither Jones nor any other legislator disclosed the plan to Montana citizens who testified in support of what they believed was a simple property valuation freeze,” the suit reads.
The suit calls pairing unpopular legislation with things that are more palatable “log rolling,” which the suit says violates the state’s constitution and the single-subject bill rule. Essentially, the title of the bill should reflect what’s in it, at least in theory.
The lawsuit even quotes Jones, saying “When later asked about using cash rebates to buy votes for a complex rate restructuring bill, Jones admitted: “On the rebate deal, I support it because now it’s what it takes to pass the bill … [S]ometimes, that’s the cost of doing business up here.”
The suit says the bill combined multiple subjects into a single bill: specific appropriation for a one-time rebate, permanent property tax rate restructuring, as well as charter overrides and municipal reimbursement. The suit says that’s unconstitutional.
It goes on to say, in direct terms, “If the Legislature can deliberately bundle appropriations with substantive policy to buy votes, then Article V, § 11(4) becomes meaningless – a suggestion rather than a command.”
The bundling also pushed legislators into an unconstitutional choice, the suit says.
“Accept the controversial permanent rate restructuring if they wanted to support the popular temporary rebate; or reject the popular rebate if they opposed the controversial restructuring,” the suit states, going on to say that’s why the single-subject rule exists.
Frustration has been mounting everywhere over the issue. Missoula County caught some criticism from legislators over an 8% tax hike in response to state legislation.
And the Department of Revenue is fielding questions on property taxes, though it said that fewer people appealed their property taxes last year in comparison to 2024.
Hertz pointed out during the session that SB 542 was likely unconstitutional, as did House Taxation chair Rep. Paul Fielder.
“I’ve been critical when Montana courts overstep their constitutional boundaries,” Hertz said in a statement. “The Legislature must abide by the same standard. The courts exist to enforce constitutional limits when the legislative process itself has been corrupted.”

Jan. 21, 2026 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceA key legislator behind an effort to overhaul Michigan’s human trafficking laws said she is hopeful — but not confident — that the Republican House majority will move reintroduced versions of the bills after they floundered during a previous chaotic lame duck session.
Still, state Rep. Kelly Breen (D-Novi) said the package was important enough to try again, considering the many obstacles victims of human trafficking face when they try to restart their lives after years or sometimes decades of abuse.
Five bills in the package were before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, a meeting that included testimony from lawmakers, prosecutors and judges, victims of human trafficking and organizations that offer resources to help them escape. 
The bills include House Bill 5009, House Bill 5010, House Bill 5011, House Bill 5012 and House Bill 5013. A few focus on expanding the list of criminal convictions survivors would be able to expunge or have a judge set aside if they were committed while being a victim of human trafficking, especially if they were coerced into committing those crimes out of fear of physical harm, death, or the safety of their loved ones.

Those who testified before the committee said survivors and active victims of sex trafficking are often forced into additional criminal activity at the order of their traffickers. Convictions follow survivors well after they are able to escape and move on, making career opportunities or basic needs, like housing, hard to find. Helping survivors regain their dignity and agency could be the difference between a survivor flourishing in a life after trafficking, or being sucked back into captivity out of desperation.
Breen sponsored one of the expungement bills. She said the lack of long-term resources and support often create an increased risk of re-exploitation. Historically, laws prohibiting prostitution were designed to both punish the person seeking the service and the person who was providing it. That has led to human trafficking victims, including children, to be prosecuted for prostitution offenses despite the fact that they were forced to commit these non-consensual acts. 
“These are the types of people that we are trying to help, and I think it’s also important to note that human trafficking is the second largest and the fastest growing criminal enterprise next to drug trafficking,” Breen said.
That wasn’t just sex trafficking, either, lawmakers said, noting that labor trafficking was also a scourge that the overall package was trying to address.
State Rep. Sarah Lightner (R-Springport), the committee’s chair, said that bills appeared to make survivors and victims of human trafficking exempt from the state’s caps on the types of crimes that can be expunged or set aside. That includes some assaultive crimes that the Legislature considered but did not include when it allowed clean slate laws with pathways to expungement.
Breen said there has been some talk about amending the bills before Lightner’s committee, but she also said that would now fall under the purview of judicial discretion.

State Rep. Carol Glanville (D-Walker) said that it was difficult to describe to someone who was not a victim or a survivor the set of circumstances that might lead a person to commit 50 or 100 crimes under duress.
Leslie King, a survivor of sex-trafficking who now runs Sacred Beginnings, one of the largest peer-mentor programs for survivors in the state, said the barriers facing victims and survivors were too tall to climb for many of those who have escaped and are trying to live normal lives.
“We fight hard daily just to stay clean. Just to become productive. Can’t get jobs because of our backgrounds and history,” King said. “We can’t keep reliving this pain, while traffickers go free. While we’re not free. We still have nightmares, but we still push through.”
King said these bills will help survivors be free.
The committee did not act on the bills and will likely have more opportunities for testimony, on these bills and others in the package. Following the committee, Breen told Michigan Advance that she hoped the GOP majority under House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) will support what they are doing — not just for the sake of survivors and victims still struggling — but for those who have made time to give testimony and lay their trauma bare before lawmakers who have yet to offer them relief.
“I believe the technical issues with the bills can be worked out. Ultimately, it’s going to depend on Speaker Hall, and I pray he listens to the testimony and will do the right thing,” Breen said. “I know we all want the same things, we just disagree on how to get there. … It is not easy to air these horrid details of their lives out in front of a room full of strangers on live television. It’s not fair to make them keep coming back, time and again, while the people who should be behind bars are still walking free.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260121_104823-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-21 15:57:05.931653

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Colleen Melody is officially the Washington state Supreme Court’s newest justice.
Melody is replacing retired Justice Mary Yu, a trailblazing jurist appointed in 2014. Gov. Bob Ferguson appointed Melody in November. 
She was formally sworn in Wednesday during a packed ceremony at the Temple of Justice in Olympia. 
“I raise my hand to serve in this role because I believe so strongly in all moments, but maybe particularly in this moment, Washingtonians deserve judges who will serve with integrity and humility and a deep respect for Washington’s independent role as a sovereign state,” Melody said. 
“I promise to listen and to work hard,” she continued. “I promise to treat everyone who comes before this court with fairness and respect. I promise to follow the rule of law. And I promise to honor the longstanding values that make Washington the best place in the entire country to live.”
Melody will be up for election this year to serve the remainder of Yu’s term through the end of 2028. She comes to the high court from the state attorney general’s office, where she worked under Ferguson. 
Ferguson made clear the importance of her new role on the nine-justice court. 
“The decisions of this court influence virtually every facet of our lives down to the most personal choices and the most consequential rights,” he said Wednesday.
For the past decade, Melody led the attorney general’s office’s civil rights division and its team of now 35 staffers. In 2017, she helped helm the state’s challenge to President Donald Trump’s first travel ban from seven predominantly Muslim countries. 
She was in the U.S. Supreme Court last year to watch arguments in the legal challenge to Trump’s executive order on birthright citizenship. Attorney General Nick Brown said he watched as she teared up when the office’s lawyers were sworn in to argue there.
Melody’s former bosses — Ferguson, Brown and Todd Bowers, the attorney general’s head of federal litigation — used many superlatives to describe her: brightest, hardest working, most caring. 
“If you think you are smart, Colleen is smarter,” Brown said. “If you think that you have prepared for your argument, Colleen has prepared more. If you think that you care about getting the right outcome, no one will care more than Justice Colleen Melody.”
Brown expressed joking frustration with the governor for taking Melody away from his office. But Brown, the former U.S. district attorney in western Washington, noted he had tried unsuccessfully to recruit her to be a federal judge. 
Ferguson called it a “privilege” to watch Melody work.
“And it was an even greater privilege to witness you applying those considerable skills and avenues into serving those in our state and our country who need it most,” he added. 
Melody is from Spokane and graduated from the University of Washington School of Law. After law school, she clerked for U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ronald Gould. Prior to joining the attorney general’s office, she worked in the civil rights division of the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.
Melody has previously successfully argued before the state Supreme Court. She joins the high court with no experience as a judge. Technically, she’s been on the bench since Jan. 1, but hasn’t gotten her own robe yet so she’s been wearing one of Yu’s that has the retired justice’s initials stitched in cursive. 
She lives on Vashon Island with her husband Zach and two young daughters.
The court Thursday is set to hear arguments on Initiative 2066, the successful ballot measure seeking to stop the state’s transition away from natural gas. 
Another vacancy will open up on the court this year, as the state constitution requires justices to retire at the end of the calendar year in which they turn 75. Justice Charles Johnson, who has been on the court since 1991, turns 75 in March.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Melody-swearing-in-cropped-1024x700.jpg,,,2026-01-21 15:57:05.931653

Mattie Daughtry/ Facebook)Maine lawmakers are considering a suite of legislation to address the child care shortage experienced by families across the state. 
The Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee heard two of these proposals during a public hearing Wednesday afternoon. Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland) introduced LD 1414, which would offer grants for providers who offer off-hour care and increase support for a state subsidy program to help Mainers afford the cost of care. 
After visiting 11 early childcare programs in six counties, Daughtry told the committee that one of the most urgent needs is infant and toddler care. Caring for those youngest children is intensive and more costly than older children, so Daughtry said some programs have had to stop accepting infants because it isn’t financially viable. 
Her plan seeks to address this by increasing the Child Care Affordability Program rates for infant and toddler care from 10% to 20%. CCAP helps parents who meet certain income criteria and are either working or in school pay for a portion of their weekly child care fees. 
The other proposal, LD 2066 from Sen. Henry Ingwersen (D-York), would make permanent a pilot program that provided subsidies for people who are employed by certain child care facilities where their own children receive care. 
“This braided approach stretches CCAP dollars further and strengthens the entire child care subsidy program,” Ingwersen said of LD 2066.
Many child care providers and advocates told the committee that the bills would help alleviate a major challenge for Maine families. No one testified in opposition. 
Destie Hohman Sprague, executive director of Maine Women’s Lobby, testified in support of both proposals, highlighting the impact child care accessibility has over women’s ability to join the workforce. 
Daughtry said people in her office have had to leave the workforce to take care of children.
Daughtry’s proposal is part of a package of legislation she is introducing as a result of her experience hearing from providers, educators and families across the state. In addition to LD 1414, Daughtry is sponsoring two other proposals to stabilize Maine’s child care system.
LD 1955 would establish several new programs to help support and incentivize people to become early childhood educators and providers. The proposal was introduced last session and received support from the Maine Senate and House of Representatives, but was sent back to the health committee earlier this month for further work. 
The third piece of the package, LD 2064, will go before the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. That proposal seeks to strengthen early childhood nutrition and learning by creating a grant program to allow school districts to enter into agreements with providers of off-site public preschool programs to provide students in those programs with breakfast, lunch and a snack.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/581088202_1226674135948722_4453094428334054597_n-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-21 15:57:05.931653

More than 40% of Iowa public college graduates finish their education debt-free, Iowa Board of Regents State Relations Officer Jillian Carlson said, and those who do take out loans receive financial counseling early in their college career “to help them right-size their debt and advise them on not taking out more than they need.”
“One question or concern that we do have is to clarify whether students who default on their loans are actually defaulting because they’re unable to make the payments, versus defaulting on their loans because they know that we would pick up 25% of the bill when they actually do have the resources to make the payments,” Carlson said.
Rep. Heather Matson, D-Ankeny, said there are important, practical questions on the topic of universities potentially being liable for defaulted loans that are not answered in the bill, such as where the money to take on these debts would come from. She also asked whether it should be the responsibility of a university to “be on the hook for” part of a loan in certain situations, like if a graduate finds themself in medical debt and must decide how they’ll use their money to stay safe and healthy.
“I think it’s important to recognize that the majority party talks a lot about personal responsibility, especially when it comes to student loans,” Matson said. “So I’m curious as to why you all are proposing to put a graduate’s financial decisions back onto a university if personal responsibility for student loans is so incredibly important.”
Rep. Jeff Shipley, R-Fairfield, said during the subcommittee meeting he believes the idea presented in the bill has “some merit.” He and subcommittee chair Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, approved the legislation to move to the Iowa House Higher Education Committee.
“My general thoughts are, we need to make sure we have some skin in the game when it comes to … the future employment of these individuals, once they graduate,” Collins said.

Sponsor Sen. Craig Richardson, R-Hopkinsville, pitched Senate Bill 38 as a way to lower overall health care costs, improve health outcomes and reduce unnecessary visits to emergency rooms throughout the state. 


SB 38 progress


“When patients can safely receive routine care such as a flu or strip testing (and) medication and disease management at their local pharmacy, they are far less likely to end up in the emergency room, and the emergency room is the most expensive place to deliver basic care,” Richardson said in a floor speech. 
Sen. Craig Richardson, R-Hopkinsville. (LRC Public Information)
He said it would also “control cost without expanding Medicaid, without adding new benefits and without changing eligibility.” 
“Pharmacies are often the most accessible health care provider, particularly in rural and underserved urban communities,” Richardson said. “Senate Bill 38 recognizes the expertise of pharmacists and allows them to practice at the top of their license, making better use of an existing health care resource, rather than creating a new government program.” 
An August 2025 report from the Legislative Research Commission (LRC) found that 90% of Kentuckians live within five miles of a community pharmacy while the state faces a shortage of primary care physicians. 
The state is expected to have a shortage of nearly 3,000 physicians by 2030, according to that report. 
SB 38 can now head to the House for consideration.

In a Friday court filing, the N.C. NAACP, Common Cause North Carolina, and individual voters who challenged the new district lines dismissed their claims. 
The map’s critics had sued, saying the plan discriminated against Black voters and retaliated against them for opposing a previous district map. 
They had wanted a panel of federal judges to prevent the state from using the new 1st Congressional District that Republican legislators approved to help their party win another seat in the U.S. House. 
The federal three-judge panel rejected their claims in November. Plaintiffs had the option of appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Asked about the reasons for the dismissal, the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, whose lawyers represented the voting rights groups, referred to a Jan. 16 press release announcing the decision. 
The press release did not say why the plaintiffs decided to dismiss the lawsuit.
Continuing to an appeal could have potentially brought the case to an unsympathetic high court.
Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in a racial gerrymandering case out of Louisiana where a decision could further weaken the Voting Rights Act.

Yvette Clarke visited the Newark migrant jail for an oversight visit on Dec. 23, 2025. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)The congresswoman accused of assaulting immigration agents outside a detention center in Newark last year is appealing a judge’s decision not to throw out the charges.
Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10) is facing 17 years in prison over allegations she assaulted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers outside Delaney Hall in Newark as officers moved to arrest city Mayor Ras Baraka on May 9, 2025. McIver and two other members of Congress were at the facility that day to conduct an oversight visit.
McIver has argued that she is protected under a clause of the U.S. Constitution that protects members of Congress while engaging in official legislative acts, and has moved to have the three counts she faces thrown out. Federal prosecutors say her alleged assaults are not connected to any legislative acts.
Judges overturn ruling that freed pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil

In November, U.S. District Court Judge Jamel K. Semper allowed two of the three counts she faces to move forward, and then in January, Semper declined to dismiss the third charge, paving the way for McIver to stand trial.
McIver had previously said she would appeal Semper’s November ruling to the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, and on Tuesday, she filed notice saying she is appealing his January ruling, too.
McIver, a first-term House member who joined Congress in 2024, pleaded not guilty in June. She has argued that the Trump administration is targeting her as political retaliation, and she has said prosecutors are treating her differently than Jan. 6 rioters who faced the same charges until they were pardoned by Trump.
Since her arrest, she’s been the target of Republican attacks, including from the president.
During a Wednesday hearing of the House Committee on Homeland Security, Rep. Eli Crane (R-Arizona) claimed immigration issues facing the nation were caused by Democrats, and noted without naming McIver that a member of the panel assaulted an ICE agent.
“Mr. Crane, I don’t know what your obsession is with me, but I am so tired of you mentioning me, and you should take that obsession and need to put it to the people of Arizona, not me. Keep my name out of your mouth,” McIver told him.
“Yeah, well, if you quit assaulting ICE agents, then I wouldn’t keep bringing you up,” Crane responded.
“Watch your mouth when you’re talking about me,” McIver said.
McIver’s attorney, Paul Fishman, and a spokesperson for her congressional office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment.
McIver returned to Delaney Hall for an oversight visit in December, the first time she visited it since the incident last spring.

In a message to the campus community, Bodnar wrote that he loves the university and is inspired by the work done at UM, but hinted at possible next steps. 
“Service has always been the animating force of my life, and (my wife) Chelsea and I would like to consider whether to pursue a new way to serve our state and our nation,” Bodnar wrote. 
It is widely expected that Bodnar will run for public office, with several individuals telling the Daily Montanan he is considering the U.S Senate seat held by Sen. Steve Daines. 
The university indicated that the leadership transition will begin immediately, after Bodnar notified the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education and the Montana Board of Regents. 
In an email, a spokesperson on behalf of UM and OCHE said due to the short notice of Bodnar’s departure in the middle of the school year, Commissioner of Higher Education Clayton Christian will work with the Board to swiftly identify a pool of highly qualified candidates to hire as a permanent replacement. 
“Even though we expect an expedited search process, Commissioner Christian will work with campus leadership during the interim to ensure the campus seamlessly navigates the leadership change. As of today there is no established timeline for the search process,” the spokesperson said. 
Bodnar took the helm of the University of Montana at the start of 2018, as the university was near the bottom of a 10-year enrollment slide that bottomed out with the COVID-19 pandemic. 
During the latter-half of his tenure, Bodnar oversaw five-straight years of enrollment growth, notching additional milestones along the way. 
“We’ve achieved record-high retention and graduation rates. We’ve significantly expanded access to education for low-income, first-generation, Native American, and military-affiliated students. We’ve nearly doubled our research award volume and earned R1 research status,” Bodnar wrote to the community. “We’ve been named the #1 university in the nation for community and national service, as well as the most military-friendly university in the nation. We completed the university’s largest fundraising campaign ever, and we’ve undertaken the largest infrastructure renewal in campus history, making investments that will benefit generations of Grizzlies to come.”
“But perhaps most importantly, we’ve fueled pride in this incredible institution – not by chasing prestige, but by being unapologetically true to who we are: a public flagship university committed to the common good and to fostering prosperity for all,” Bodnar continued. “Our work has never been about ‘fixing’ a university. It’s been about building a durable foundation for the future – one centered on students, grounded in values, and powered by belief in what public higher education can still mean in this country.”
Bodnar came to the academic leadership world with an unconventional resume. Before UM, he was a senior executive at General Electric in its transportation division. 
Prior to that, Bodnar had extensive experience in the U.S. military, graduating from West Point and serving as a Green Beret in the U.S. Army’s 1st Special Forces Group. 
He also excelled as a student, and was selected as both a Rhodes Scholar and Truman Scholar to pursue graduate studies at the University of Oxford. 
Bodnar’s resume is also one befitting of a political candidate in Montana — Montana’s congressional delegation includes two Navy Seals and individuals with extensive business backgrounds — and rumors of his interest in a possible campaign for office have made the rounds during the last two weeks, with several individuals confirming to the Daily Montanan that Bodnar was considering the option. 
The reports earlier this month that Bodnar was considering a bid, but as an independent candidate, sparked debate among the state’s politicos as to the viability of a third-party candidacy, whether he could be swayed onto a Democratic platform, and who might be funding his bid. 
Former Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat who has endorsed Reilly Neill in the Democratic primary for Senate, told the Daily Montanan that while “Daines is a smart guy … Daines is very beatable. A Democrat can beat him.”
“Seth Bodnar is not going to win as an independent,” Schweitzer said. 
The former governor added that he suspected there is a substantial amount of money behind Bodnar’s potential run, calling it a product of the “Montana-centric consulting industrial complex,” with further speculation elected Republicans are part of the equation to help keep Daines in office. 
Bodnar has not made any official announcement about his future plans. 
Daines is a two-term incumbent who last won re-election in 2020 against former Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock by 10 points.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
School districts with two or more outstanding audits will either be put on probation or lose their accreditation under a temporary rule change the Mississippi Board of Education approved Thursday.
Before, school districts could have missed filing four consecutive annual audits before they faced losing accreditation. Other consequences remain in place, which include possibly blocking the drawing down of federal funds and being prevented from applying for more.
The temporary rule change is an urgent response to concerns about the finances at Mississippi’s school districts. 
In November, the Mississippi Department of Education took over Okolona schools because of the district’s dire financial situation. The district was unable to make payroll because of low cash reserves. The state took over Wilkinson County schools on Thursday for academic issues, but agency officials also noted difficulty parsing the district’s financial documents. 
Okolona and Wilkinson are among 47 school districts that have failed to file one or more financial audits — a finding department officials had previously brought before the board.
When asking the state board to approve the temporary rule change, top compliance and accountability officials at the state education department argued that late financial reporting can compromise public welfare.
“It’s not being a few days late or it’s not for being a couple of months late,” Paula Vanderford, chief accountability officer at the Mississippi Department of Education, said during the state board meeting. “We’re talking about having outstanding audits where there’s no information within the agency regarding their financial status.”
Temporary rules can go into effect immediately upon filing with the Mississippi Secretary of State, unlike permanent rule changes, which would require the education department to wait at least 25 days to gather public comments as well as a more thorough filing.

“In November, we sounded the alarm about this, and in 60 days we have action,” state Board of Education Chairman Matt Miller said Thursday about addressing the backlog of school district financial audits and preventing additional state takeovers of school districts. “This is the action I envisioned we’d take.”
“To those out there who I will not name who say we’re not doing anything about it,” he said. “This is something we’re doing about it.”
Up-to-date audits not only give state education leaders insight into school district finances, they also are required under federal law. 
Districts that miss one financial audit would face more frequent monitoring and check-ups by state education department officials and may receive agency approval to draw down some state administered funds per federal guidance.
Other factors have also contributed to a backlog of school district’s on-time financial audit submissions, including a shortage of approved auditing firms. Also, some school districts can’t afford the audit firms’ rates.
The Mississippi Office of the State Auditor sent out a December memo that requires audit firms to provide written justification to the director of audits prior to preparing new reports. The auditor’s office also agreed to prioritize school audits before the March 31 deadline.
At the Thursday state Board of Education meeting, Vanderford and Kym Wiggins, chief operating officer for the education department, stressed the importance of early intervention to prevent further state takeovers. That can be a challenge.
“There is such a profound lack of skilled persons to do that work,” Wiggins said. “There is a tremendous need for capable assistance. We’re trying to figure out here in our office how we can build that infrastructure here to provide those supports at the district level beyond just our regular annual certification.”
The agency’s Office of School Financial Services has also agreed to increase its availability to school districts that need technical assistance.
Does the agency have the capacity to handle more monitoring and intervention? “We feel this is important, necessary work and we always manage to get it done,” Vanderford said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/17124614/3X0A8480-2.jpg,,,2026-01-21 15:57:05.931653

(File photo from iStock / Getty Images Plus)COLUMBIA — A bill advancing in the House would ban hospitals and doctors’ offices from requiring physicians to sign noncompete clauses that prevents them from practicing medicine in the area for a certain length of time if they leave.
The bill, which the five-member subcommittee supported unanimously, could help offset a statewide physician shortage, keeping doctors from leaving their practice areas and potentially attracting more to the state, doctors said. The vote Tuesday sent the proposal to the full House Medical, Military, Public, and Municipal Affairs Committee, commonly called 3M.
Doctors who sign a noncompete agreement but leave their jobs for any reason often have to go far from their existing patients, cutting off care, doctors said. The issue becomes particularly acute in areas with few doctors, where every health professional is vital to maintaining the community’s health, they said.
Under the bill, doctors could continue to practice in the area immediately and tell their patients where they were going so patients could choose to continue care with them.
“We need to agree that anything that will lead to physicians leaving, particularly rural and underserved communities, when they don’t want to is something that’s not good for South Carolina, for access to care, for our patients, for health outcomes,” said Jonathan Gleason, executive vice president at Prisma Hospital.
Prisma does not require doctors to sign noncompete clauses, Gleason added.
Jessica Mendelsohn, a Fort Mill doctor, ran into issues with noncompete clauses when hiring for her private practice, New South Family Medicine, she said. Her husband, David Mendelsohn, and another doctor wanted to join her, but they had signed contracts barring them from working in the area if they left their jobs.
The Mendelsohns spent thousands of dollars trying to get David Mendelsohn out of his contract. Eventually, the Mendelsohns rented a separate office away from the practice’s main building to get David Mendelsohn and the practice’s other doctor out of the zone where they couldn’t practice, Jessica Mendelsohn said.
Patients who wanted to keep their longtime doctors had to drive longer distances, even though their physicians still lived in the community, she said. The contracts also discourage doctors from jumping on other opportunities, Mendelsohn said.
“Noncompete clauses are worsening an already-fragile workplace by restricting physician mobility and discouraging independent practice,” Mendelsohn said.
Patients who can’t or don’t want to travel further need to decide whether to find a new doctor, which can be a long process, or stop getting regular health care altogether, Mendelsohn said.
Sometimes, patients in rural areas or those with few doctors don’t have a choice of a new physician when one leaves, said Cleave Ham, a retired radiologist and board member for the South Carolina Medical Association. If a specialist is forced out of the area, that often means the community loses that person’s skills altogether, he said.
Increasing flexibility for doctors to leave jobs could attract more doctors to the state, Ham said.
“I think that physicians are looking for this,” Ham said.
The state has a similar ban on noncompete clauses for attorneys, recognizing the significance of the relationship between an attorney and their clients. The same should be true for doctors and their patients, Ham said.
A hospital system or doctors’ office could still penalize physicians who quickly quit their jobs. Contracts could require anyone who left after less than three years of work to repay relocation fees, signing bonuses and retention bonuses.
Doctors generally don’t start turning a profit for their employers until after that three-year mark, said Austin Smallwood, a lobbyist for the South Carolina Hospital Association.
Smallwood suggested also allowing hospitals to ask for repayment of a year’s salary for doctors who leave before that three-year mark, though legislators did not add that to the bill Tuesday.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Studies-doctor-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-21 14:58:14.324446

(Courtesy of BorderPlex Digital Assets)A coalition of 16 environmental, behavioral health and community groups on Tuesday signed onto a letter to New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and state Environment Department Secretary James Kenney demanding more opportunities for public involvement with Project Jupiter, the massive data center complex being built in Doña Ana County.
The letter comes one month after state officials deemed the developer’s air quality permit “incomplete, and builds on previous demands from the New Mexico Environmental Law Center, which is suing Doña Ana County officials over the project.
In their letter, officials with the 16 groups wrote that Project Jupiter poses “significant risks to the public health and environment, public transparency, and regulatory accountability.” 
The letter noted ongoing issues with safe drinking water in Southern New Mexico “due to the systemic neglect and failures by local and state officials and agencies to ensure all New Mexicans have access to consistently clean and safe drinking water.” Project Jupiter, the letter continued, represents a new threat: “Hyperscale data centers are rapidly popping-up across the nation, typically locating in low-income communities and communities of color who already bear the burdens of structural environmental racism.”
The groups joining the New Mexico Environmental Law Center’s push include WildEarth Guardians, Valencia Water Watchers, ProgressNow NM and others. They outlined five demands related to the project’s air quality permit:

extending the public comment period by 30 days
holding public hearings no less than 90 days after NMED shares its analyses with the public
making Project Jupiter’s applications public, including all information, modeling and technical data
distributing applications and notices in both English and Spanish
holding public hearings locally in Santa Teresa

In a statement to Source NM, Environment Department spokesperson Drew Goretzka said that the department has already complied with several of the requests outlined in Tuesday’s letter.
“For example, all information related to the applications is available on NMED’s website or via an IPRA request aside from the Spanish translation and modeling report, which will be posted shortly,” Goretzka wrote. “On other requests — specifically those surrounding the format and timing of a public hearing — NMED will make a determination once our review of the applications are complete. We appreciate the organizations’ input and will continue to consider their requests as the process moves forward.”
Source NM was first to report that Project Jupiter’s developers sought permission to emit as much air pollution as New Mexico’s two largest cities combined. State environment officials subsequently deemed the developer’s air quality applications incomplete, and gave the developer until Monday to file additional information.
Acoma LLC, the developer behind Project Jupiter, complied, according to an NMED spokesperson. Environment Department officials are reviewing the recently submitted information to determine whether the permit applications are still incomplete.
Acoma LLC representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Residents, climate advocates and some state lawmakers have expressed concerns that Project Jupiter could flout the state’s landmark Energy Transition Act, which sets a series of benchmarks for utilities to eventually use 100% renewable energy sources. Developers envision Project Jupiter as a “microgrid” that can power itself without tapping into an existing utility company’s electric grid, fueled by natural gas generating stations. Critics say a 2025 law governing microgrids seems to exempt them from complying with several requirements of the Energy Transition Act.
Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces) introduced a draft bill that would give state regulators more power over microgrids and would require them to comply with every facet of the ETA.
“It’s a path to having very dirty energy for these massive data centers rather than using more renewable energy as we require full public utilities,” Steinborn previously told Source NM. “Microgrids pose a threat to the climate and New Mexico’s air quality if we don’t establish minimum renewable energy and other standards regarding water efficiency.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Project-Jupiter-rendering.png,,,2026-01-21 14:58:14.324446

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)The federal government confirmed Wednesday it has increased immigration operations across Maine as immigrants are being advised by local organizers to shelter in place as apprehensions  continue. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed in an email that it began on Tuesday what it’s calling “Operation Catch of the Day” in Maine, after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement earlier told Fox News that it had arrested nearly 50 people so far. 
Those numbers have not been independently verified by Maine Morning Star nor community organizers because of Homeland Security’s otherwise silence on the matter and the inherent challenges with tracking people in the immigration system. Maine’s congressional delegation, the governor and local public officials have also not gotten responses from President Donald Trump’s administration about operations in Maine. 
“We have no information,” said Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins Press Secretary Blake Kernan. 
The community hotline tracking enforcement action in Maine began ringing continuously with reports of sightings on Tuesday, after the mayors of the state’s two largest cities announced last week that they were expecting a surge in ICE activity. 
As organizers continue to crowdsource sightings and attempt to track down specifics, the mutual aid group Project Relief Maine has called for immigrants to shelter in place and for Portland Public Schools to close for the remainder of the week. 
“Right now, it is unsafe to be outside, whether walking, driving, or waiting at bus stops,” the group posted on social media. 
DHS Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde told Fox News that the agency has 1,400 targets in Maine. In an email, DHS said they are “targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have terrorized communities.” DHS only released information about four of the nearly 50 people reported to have been arrested Tuesday. Those the agency highlighted have convictions such as aggravated assault and operating under the influence of alcohol. 
Meanwhile, ICE detained an Angolan man at a routine check in on Tuesday at the Scarborough field office and his lawyer told the Bangor Daily News that he has no criminal record to justify his detention. A federal judge has ordered ICE to explain why the agency detained him. 
As of the latest data from November, about 73% of people held nationwide in ICE detention have no criminal conviction. And, many of those convicted committed only minor offenses, such as traffic violations.
Echoing Maine Republicans, Hyde and DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin criticized Maine for restricting local police cooperation with federal immigration authorities. 
“Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” McLaughlin said in a statement.
Police are already not required to and generally do not have the authority to enforce immigration laws. A new state law, which won’t take effect until 90 days after the current legislative session adjourns, aims to prevent local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, while still permitting police to investigate crimes and execute judicial warrants.

(Photo via Google Earth)A long-simmering defamation lawsuit involving two security experts arrested at the Dallas County Courthouse during a midnight “break-in” is now headed for trial.
Gary DeMercurio and Justin Lawson Wynn are suing Dallas County and retired former Sheriff Chad Leonard for false arrest and defamation. The case is scheduled to go to trial next week, on Jan. 26, 2026.
In 2019, DeMercurio and Wynn were working for Coalfire Labs, a Colorado-based cybersecurity firm that had been retained by the Iowa Judicial Branch to perform a security analysis of Iowa’s court system. As part of that contract, the Judicial Branch provided a “letter of authorization” to Coalfire employees, euphemistically called a “get out of jail free” letter, that was intended to protect them from being wrongfully arrested for their testing activities.
The contract allegedly contemplated the surreptitious entry of courthouse buildings during daytime and evening hours, with no advance notice given to local law enforcement or security personnel.
On the evening of Sept. 10, 2019, DeMercurio and Wynn went to the Dallas County Courthouse in Adel and allegedly found one of the main doors was unlocked. In subsequent depositions, the two recalled they latched the door and then, using a thin, flexible cutting board, manipulated the latch to unlock it and gain entry.
The two said they then entered the courthouse, where they tripped an alarm and then looked through various rooms while waiting for law enforcement to arrive. Shortly after midnight, Dallas County deputies arrived on the scene, and DeMercurio and Wynn identified themselves and provided the deputies with their “get out of jail free” letter.
Court records indicate the deputies verified the letter’s authenticity and then told DeMercurio and Wynn they were free to go. However, their lawsuit alleges, Sheriff Leonard arrived on the scene minutes later, “refused to recognize the authority of the Iowa Judicial Branch” to allow such security testing, and then ordered his deputies to arrest the two men.
DeMercurio and Wynn were booked into the county jail and held for roughly 20 hours on charges of burglary in the third degree and possession of burglary tools. The charges were later amended to trespassing and then dropped altogether.
Court records indicate DeMercurio and Wynn hope to show that when Sheriff Leonard arrived on the scene,  Deputy Joey Marchant stated, “This ought to be good” and then said, “I better shut my video tape off,” and switched off his body camera.
During pretrial depositions, Marchant was asked why he shut off his body camera when Leonard approached him to discuss the matter. “There’s been times before that officers will engage in conversation that periodically we have … (shut) off videos before because it is just a conversation between us officers,” he said.
When asked whether that was consistent with department policy on body cameras, Marchant stated, “Again, like I said, in the course of our duties, there are times that we do have conversations with other officers that are  — not necessarily going to say private, but it’s a conversation between us officers to formulate, make decisions, things of that nature.”
Leonard acknowledged comments to reporter
The defamation claim against Leonard that is part of the lawsuit is tied in part to a November 2019 article that appeared on the Ars Technica cybersecurity website.
The plaintiffs allege Leonard was interviewed by the article’s author and that the sheriff described DeMercurio and Wynn as being found inside the courthouse, “crouched down like turkeys peeking over the balcony. Here we are at 12:30 in the morning confronted with this issue — on September 11, no less. We have two unknown people in our courthouse, in a government building, carrying backpacks that remind me and several other deputies of maybe the pressure-cooker bombs.”
During a pretrial deposition, Leonard indicated he “probably did” make the comments attributed to him on that point, although he questioned the reported reference to “several” other deputies.
In that same August 2024 deposition, Leonard acknowledged he wasn’t happy that Coalfire Labs’ security check had, in his view, put his deputies in harm’s way.
“You can’t do this,” Leonard said at the time. “Those deputies were all were probably going (to the courthouse) at a high rate of speed to get there. They were probably thinking the worst, and I don’t want one of them getting — one of them said he about smacked a deer at 100 (miles per hour), you know. I got to go to his wife and tell her than, ‘Yeah, I’m sorry, your husband died for a fake call.’ So that stuff sits with me.”’
In his deposition, Leonard also said that if Coalfire Labs had contacted him and given him all of the documentation showing DeMercurio and Wynn were authorized to be in the building, he most likely would have asked Dallas County Attorney Chuck Sinnard to immediately drop the charges.
“If they would have called and given me all the stuff that we needed, that they were authorized to break in, they were just — I mean, if they, if all of those things were in there, then, yeah, I would have gave it to Chuck and said, ‘You deal with it,’ because – yeah,” Leonard testified.
Widespread fallout from courthouse break-in
The arrest of DeMercurio and Wynn sparked controversy and complaints from state lawmakers that the Iowa Judicial Branch had hired Coalfire to commit crimes, placing law enforcement officers and others at risk. Mark Cady, then the Iowa Supreme Court’s chief justice, apologized to lawmakers for the incident, saying it had diminished “public trust and confidence in the court system.”
At the time, judicial branch officials said they had not intended to authorize Coalfire to physically break into buildings or enter facilities outside normal business hours.
In their lawsuit, Wynn and DeMercurio allege their contract specifically called for “physical attacks” on buildings, including lockpicking and physical “penetration” of the premises.
Dallas County has argued that Iowa’s state court administrator had no “authority to grant permission to enter a county owned courthouse,” and because of that, there is “no set of facts showing any unlawfulness” in the arrest of Wynn and DeMercurio.
The lawsuit was initially filed in 2021 in Dallas County District Court and in May 2022, it was moved to Polk County District Court. In June 2023, it moved to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa based on a federal statute that allows individuals to sue, for civil rights violations, government employees whose actions are controlled by state law.
In November 2023, a federal judge dismissed that particular element of the lawsuit, which resulted in the remaining elements of the lawsuit being remanded back to state court where it was first filed.

Former Missouri House Speaker John Diehl, who pleaded guilty last year  to wire fraud, is asking a federal judge for leniency as he faces the possibility of years behind bars.
Diehl admitted in September to defrauding the U.S. Small Business Administration out of $379,900 by obtaining a pandemic loan intended to help struggling small businesses and using the money for personal expenses. Those included payments on a Tesla, an Audi and a Jeep, as well as pool maintenance, country-club dues, mortgage bills and college tuition for a family member.
Wire fraud is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine or both.  
In a sentencing memorandum filed earlier this month by Diehl’s attorneys, he asks for a “noncustodial sentence,” meaning a punishment that would not include prison.
Diehl argues prison is unnecessary because he is a first-time offender who repaid the full amount before sentencing. His lawyers say his guilty plea, acceptance of responsibility and early restitution demonstrate genuine remorse. They also cite his age, health issues, work history and family responsibilities, including caring for aging parents.
Three pages of the sentencing memo are redacted. 
Diehl was originally scheduled to be sentenced Friday, but both his attorneys and federal prosecutors asked for a delay. The stated reason for the postponement was largely redacted from the court filing, aside from a line saying: “The parties anticipate that they will require an additional 30 to 45 days to conclude the investigation.”
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office could not comment on the investigation that warranted the sentencing delay. 
At the height of his political career, Diehl was arguably Missouri’s most powerful elected official. That ended in 2015, when The Kansas City Star reported he had exchanged sexually inappropriate messages with a 19-year-old House intern. Diehl initially refused to resign but stepped down after losing support within his party.
After leaving office, Diehl largely stayed out of public view before reemerging in 2018 as an advocate for a company he co-owned that sought to mine cobalt in Missouri’s Bootheel.
He later became embroiled in controversy in Independence, when the FBI began scrutinizing a contract to demolish the power plant in Missouri City owned by Independence Power & Light. Diehl was an attorney for the company that won the contract despite bidding twice as much as the other company seeking the job.
A federal grand jury issued subpoenas seeking records related to the deal, including minutes from closed Independence City Council meetings, and investigators interviewed multiple city officials. Only one person has faced any criminal charges connected to the Independence contracts — attorney and former Jackson County official John Carnes — who was sentenced to a 21-month prison sentence for tax evasion.
A Kansas City businessman named Joseph Campbell who was connected to the utility contract testified under oath that the FBI questioned him about Diehl, whom he accused of trying to create a fake attorney-client relationship in order to keep from having to hand over certain documents the government had requested through a subpoena.
Diehl denied Campbell’s accusation at the time. 
Campbell was indicted by a federal grand jury in Kansas last month for federal wire fraud and money laundering involving pandemic-era loan programs.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)An Iowa House higher education subcommittee Wednesday supported legislation that would eliminate a voting student position on the Iowa Board of Regents, among other changes to its membership and policies relating to academic program approval and review.
If passed, House Study Bill 534  would replace the student member of the board of regents with a ninth member appointed by the governor and add seven ex-officio, nonvoting members — three would be students, two would be state senators and two would be state representatives.
The board of regents would be required to create policies relating to post-tenure review, approval of potential new academic programs at universities before they are implemented and the barring of faculty senates or councils from “exercising any governance authority over the institution,” the bill stated. Biennial review and approval of all general education requirements and low-enrollment academic programs would also be required.

The bill would allow the General Assembly to pass joint resolutions, with approval from the governor, “to disapprove any individual, ongoing expenditure by the board or an institution under the governance thereof.” If a joint resolution is passed and approved, the board or university would be required to terminate the disapproved expenditure.
Removing the voting capability of students was one concern brought up by Iowa Board of Regents State Relations Officer Jillian Carlson during the subcommittee meeting.
“We do really value the input of students on all three campuses, and that we feel like the governor has done a good job with selection and the rotating cycle from people from University of Iowa, Iowa State and UNI the past several years,” Carlson said.
Subcommittee member Rep. Heather Matson, D-Ankeny, wondered during the meeting what problem removing the voting capabilities of students on the board would be solving, and she believes in both the power of civic engagement and the need for student voices to be heard.
“I think it’s important to say, while we have students in the room, student voices are critical in our communities, in our society, and certainly at our regents institutions,” Matson said. “And it’s also important to note that voices are made that much more powerful when they have a vote.”
Subcommittee chair Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, said the legislation would actually expand the number of students on the board and ensure representation from each state university, though he “didn’t think it was appropriate that all three of them be voting.”
“We can’t expect different results if we continue to operate the same as we always have,” Collins said. “And so there’s many provisions in this bill that I think cleans up the governance process, and it really gets our institutions focused back on what we need them to be working on, which is providing for the workforce needs of our state.”
The bill would also expand the definition of “accrediting agency” to be “a legal entity, or a part of a legal entity, that conducts accrediting activities through voluntary, nonfederal peer review and makes decisions concerning the accreditation or preaccreditation status of institutions, programs, or both.”
A subcommittee meeting scheduled for 12:30 p.m. Jan. 22 will go over legislation to require the Iowa Board of Regents to direct state universities to apply for accreditation from the Commission for Public Higher Education and “take any steps necessary to qualify for such accreditation.
The Commission for Public Higher Education was created in partnership by the State University System of Florida, the University System of Georgia, the University of North Carolina System, the University of South Carolina System, the Texas A&M University System, and the University of Tennessee System and launched in June.

(Photo by Dave Cummings/New Hampshire Bulletin)Boy, New Hampshire Legislature, you sure know how to make a national impression.
Last week, as I’m sure you’ve heard by now, a leaked Signal chat outed Rep. Kristin Noble, the Republican chairwoman of the New Hampshire House Education Policy and Administration Committee, as a fan of school segregation.
“When we have segregated schools we can add all the fun stuff lol,” Noble, of Bedford, wrote in the chat. “… Imagine the scores though if we had schools for them and some for us.”
In a statement released shortly after her comments came to light, Noble seemed to suggest that she wasn’t talking about racial segregation, LOL, but ideological segregation.
“It’s funny to watch the Democrats feign outrage when I thought they’d be supportive of managing their own schools, with libraries full of porn, biological males in girls sports and bathrooms, and as much DEI curriculum as their hearts desire,” the House Republican Office wrote in a memo sent on behalf of Noble. “Schools like that will have terrible test scores because they focus on social justice rather than academics.”
As a point of clarification, I don’t think Democrats were pretending to be outraged. It takes only a superficial knowledge of American history to understand that “segregated schools” has a very specific and painful meaning in this country, so I think the outrage was pretty authentic. Second, as much as anxious Republican leaders like to urge voters to take people like Noble and President Donald Trump “seriously but not literally,” the past year has been a hard lesson in why that is terrible advice — so let’s assume she means what she says. Third, Noble’s probably right that test scores at her dream school would be higher, but that’s only because there would be less to learn after removing chapters on Charles Darwin, Harriet Tubman, Susan B. Anthony, Jonas Salk, and the many others on the right’s growing enemies list. Fourth, I think maybe she hasn’t been inside a public school recently?
Finally, when it comes to educational philosophy, I don’t think Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte has much in common with Republican Rep. Kristin Noble.
What I mean is, there are two basic ways you can view the Republican push for school vouchers. 
There’s the free-market argument espoused by the Ayotte wing, which is the idea that public schools just need some good old-fashioned business competition to boost student achievement and alleviate the burden on taxpayers. One of the problems with the privatization model, and there are plenty, is that when you game it out, it’s hard to see how things get better for low-income and special needs students. Equity will be the first victim of that system as fully implemented, and the only true winners (sorry, taxpayers) will be the businesses that capitalize on the destruction of the public model.
Then there’s the argument articulated (although that’s probably not the right word) by Noble last week. 
“Republicans have been self-segregating out of the leftist indoctrination centers for decades. If Democrats had their own schools, and we had our own, families wouldn’t need to avail themselves of the wildly successful education freedom account program.”
What she’s asking for is a school system that isolates half of all children from information that challenges a particular world view. She seems to be expressing a desire for a curriculum that erases the discomfort and inconvenience of lessons on, say, climate change, communicable diseases, human sexuality, slavery, genocide, and poverty, for example, in favor of comfortable affirmations of a warped patriotism that subjugates truth itself. Human history is filled with examples of cults, religions, and whole societies that viewed knowledge as a threat, and knowledge is precisely what Noble is railing against. She is very much not alone — in New Hampshire or the nation.
So here’s the political calculation for Republicans, broadly.
The free-market argument by itself is probably not enough to sway middle- and lower-class families of either party on school privatization, because in most ways the economic philosophy fueling the pro-voucher argument (call it what you will — Reaganomics, voodoo economics, trickle-down economics) has made life more challenging for the American family over the past half-century not less so. I mean, how bad do things have to get for voters to elect the let’s-blow-the-whole-thing-up guy to be president?
And the segregationist bloc to which Noble belongs is certainly having a moment thanks to that president, but I doubt many independents or Republicans in the Ayotte mold would actually want to take up residence in her Dystopialand.
Combine those two disparate political populations under one Republican banner, though, and you’ve got yourself a robust voucher movement.
If it’s hard for you to see what the Republican endgame is for anything that’s happening right now — the anti-immigrant violence, tax cuts for the wealthy, the incoherent foreign policy, the increased downward pressure on the lower classes, the dismantling of institutions — you’re not alone. But you should know that the confusion exists because there isn’t just one endgame but a whole bunch of them, none of them fresh, and it’s just the moment that’s unique.
We are living through a time where several Republican tracks that once ran parallel are crossing. And like her president, Noble is not an accident of that intersection but a product of it.
So, to expect anything other than chaos is asking too much of a conservative movement that doesn’t even seem to possess knowledge of itself. Or, more likely, the knowledge is there for the taking but they just don’t want it.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Statehouse3-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-21 14:58:14.324446

Tim Reed, R-Brookings, testifies to the South Dakota Senate Local Government Committee on Jan. 22, 2025, at the Capitol in Pierre. (Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)State Sen. Tim Reed opened a bill hearing Wednesday by saying a former state economic development commissioner “complied with the statute as it exists today” when the ex-commissioner waited one year before becoming an executive of a company he helped recruit while working for state government. 
But Reed said the law needs to change, and a committee of South Dakota lawmakers at the Capitol in Pierre agreed.
Under current law, state officers and employees involved in a state contract with a company have to wait one year to take a job with that company after leaving state government. The bill would extend the waiting period to two years when a contract exceeds $1 million.
Company that hired state’s former head of economic development benefits from $69 million in aid

“What this bill is about,” said Reed, a Republican from Brookings, is whether the current law “adequately protects public trust.” 
Reed was referring to South Dakota Searchlight reporting about a former state economic development commissioner, Steve Westra. A year after leaving state government, Westra took a job with CJ Schwan’s. While working for the state, Westra had signed the first pledge of state aid benefiting construction of the company’s $550 million, 650-employee food production plant in northern Sioux Falls. State aid benefiting the project now totals $69 million worth of tax rebates, loans and grants.
Without opposition, the Senate State Affairs Committee advanced Reed’s bill to the Senate.
No one besides Reed testified for or against the bill. Reed expressed support for the CJ Schwan’s project.
“This bill is not about the CJ Schwan’s economic development project, and it is not intended to slow, discourage or second-guess economic development efforts in South Dakota,” Reed said.
After the committee vote, the bill was placed on the Senate’s consent calendar — a list of broadly supported bills the Senate can pass in a single vote without debate unless a senator asks to withdraw a bill from the list.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida’s education commissioner is not happy with the conduct of some locally elected school board members, and he wants to do something about it.
Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas made clear Wednesday during a Board of Education meeting in Tallahassee that he wants the Legislature to give his department more authority over school board members seeking to “elevate themselves for political reasons.”
His comments came amid complaints against Clay County School Board member Robert Alvero.
Alvero came under scrutiny last month for comments he made in a social media video, that “I have had 80% more negative experience with the African American community in this country than with white people.”
Following the comments, Kamoutsas in December said he was “directing” Alvero to come before the state board.
Wednesday, Alvero didn’t show.

 More of Alvero’s comment:

	 “With that being said, doesn’t mean I haven’t had good experiences with African American people. I have met a lot of great African American people, and I am still friends with them because they’re good, decent people. But that’s the 20% of the people I have met. They’re African Americans. The other 80%, they’re being nasty. They’re being rude. They’re being problematic. Always trying to fight. Always disrespecting. So why would I want to be around people like that?”

“For me, this unfortunate incident is a reminder that the Legislature needs to look at this board’s authority with regard to school board members. Too many have sought to elevate themselves for political reasons, disregarding their duty to educate children, and this board’s unfortunately limited in its ability to demand accountability,” Kamoutsas said. 
“Comments that distract from the mission of serving students undermines the confidence of this entire school system,” Kamoutsas said. 
The state Board of Education comprises gubernatorial appointees, while local school boards are elected by citizens of their respective counties.
Alvero retained an attorney, former state Rep. Anthony Sabatini, a conservative firebrand.
In an email response to questions from the Phoenix Wednesday, Sabatini replied, in entirety, “The state education board should cease attempting to be the political correctness police” [sic] 
In a social media post in December, Sabatini said Alvero is “receiving ridiculous criticism based on so-called ‘racist’ & ‘politically incorrect’ remarks he made.”
“The fake outrage against Alvero is complete & total nonsense,” Sabatini wrote. 
“ANY adverse state action taken against Alvero in an attempt to punish him & force him into adopting politically correct viewpoints, will be responded to with a lawsuit for First Amendment Retaliation.” 
State board chair Ryan Petty said of Clay County voters, “Hopefully they’ll take action at the next election to remove him from office.”
Critics call for lawmaker Sabatini’s resignation from Florida House over inflammatory rhetoric

Republican state Sen. Jennifer Bradley, who represents that region of the state, called upon Alvero to resign last month, as did House Speaker-designate Sam Garrison, like Bradley of Fleming Island.
“We will always protect people’s First Amendment rights to say what they want to say, but we also have to be mindful that our children hear that,” state board member Layla Collins said. 
In 2020, critics called for Sabatini to resign from the Florida House over his own inflammatory rhetoric.
Kamoutsas has not replied to an emailed question from the Phoenix asking about what precedent oversight by appointees over elected officials would follow, or set.

A look at other counties
Since Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed Kamoutsas last year, he has focused on local school boards, including in Alachua and Leon counties.
In Alachua, a similar situation arose. Kamoutsas called in front of the state board that county’s vice chair, Tina Certain, after comments and actions in the aftermath of the deaths of pro wrestler Hulk Hogan and conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
“This board took a lot of criticism for our attempts to hold the Alachua School Board vice chair Certain accountable for her actions, and we were accused of doing that in a very partisan manner and because of partisanship, and nothing could have been further from the truth,” Petty said. 

The Clay County situation shows that accountability comes regardless of political ideology, Petty insisted, although he described Alvero as “a so-called conservative, because I don’t think the views that he expressed were conservative in any nature — not that we’re getting into the politics of it.” Petty added: “But the comments he made were absolutely inexcusable, and should never be uttered by anybody in a position there.”
According to his bio on the Clay County school website, Alvero has served with the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department and Florida State Guard.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)A state committee tasked with evaluating New Hampshire’s disability care system has launched a formal review and scheduled a series of public meetings to discuss the system in the wake of reports of systemic abuse and neglect.
In New Hampshire, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are entitled to care services paid for and overseen by the state. To provide this care, the state contracts with a network of private agencies. In November, the Bulletin published a series of articles that revealed instances of abuse and neglect — sometimes fatal — committed by caretakers against people with disabilities within this system. State records obtained by the Bulletin show that 467 credible reports of abuse, neglect, and exploitation committed against people in the system were investigated by the state and 119 deaths occurred across the system from January 2023 through the first six months of 2025. The Bulletin found systemic failures of oversight and prevention that allowed the abuse and neglect to happen.
The Systems Review Committee of the New Hampshire Developmental Services Quality Council announced it will be holding eight monthly meetings starting Friday to discuss different facets of the system. At the end of its review, the committee plans to release a final report and a series of recommendations for systemic changes. In a press release, the committee said the meetings “are being held in response to recent reports by the NH Bulletin regarding abuse and deaths within the system.”
The meetings are all scheduled for two hours in Concord at the New Hampshire Commission for Human Rights, 57 Regional Drive, Suite 8. To request disability accommodations, the committee asks people to email nhcasdqc@gmail.com at least 7 days in advance of the meeting. Here are the scheduled meetings:

On Friday at 9 a.m., the committee will provide an overview of the system with Jessica Gorton, chief of the Bureau of Developmental Services — the state agency responsible for overseeing the system — as an invited guest speaker.
On Feb. 26 at noon, the committee will hold a meeting discussing the certification process for care homes, adult protective services, the legal requirements for reporting abuse, and the abuse registry.
On March 26 at noon, the committee will hold a meeting discussing the responsibilities of providers, nurses, and doctors in the system.
On April 23 at noon, the committee will hold a meeting discussing the responsibilities of area agencies — private agencies contracted by the state to coordinate disability care.
On May 28 at noon, the committee will hold a meeting to discuss complaints and investigations with a complaint investigator and the director of adult protective services as invited guest speakers.
On June 25 at noon, the committee will hold a meeting discussing criminal prosecution with New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella as an invited guest speaker.
On July 23 at noon, the committee will hold a meeting discussing the role of the state’s public guardian with Lisabritt Solesky, director of the Office of the Public Guardian as an invited guest speaker.
On Aug. 27 at noon, the committee tentatively plans to hold a meeting finalizing its report and recommendations.

The Systems Review Committee is not the only group looking into the system. The Disability Rights Center-NH — a federally designated agency tasked with investigating suspected abuse and neglect against people with disabilities in New Hampshire, pursuing litigation on behalf of the state’s disability community, and serving people with disabilities through other means — launched an investigation late last year into the system at large. It plans to have a report of its own findings released sometime around early summer. Additionally, state Sen. David Rochefort introduced legislation last week aimed at addressing some of the systemic issues that have led to abuse and neglect in the system.

After months of opposition to two ICE facilities in Williston, the town took a strong – if symbolic – stand.

“I’m assuming you’re not all here for the budget,” Ted Kenney, chair of the Williston Selectboard, told the crowd of people attending the Tuesday night meeting. “I’m assuming you’re here to talk about ICE.”
Soon after, the five-member town board unanimously passed the first known resolution in the state condemning the surveillance and enforcement actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which operates two large facilities off Highway 2. 
“Of course, it doesn’t have any legal binding,” said Christine Hallquist, who wrote the resolution. A former Democratic candidate for governor who now runs the Vermont Community Broadband Board, Hallquist said she wrote the resolution independent of her state role. “The whole idea of stopping ICE and stopping the federal government has to be grassroots.”

Greta D’Agostino, the vice chair who proposed the resolution during last week’s meeting, said that while passage would be primarily symbolic, “it does send a strong message that this is not what we as a town uphold as our values and our beliefs.” 
The town’s decision came after about ten anti-ICE protesters spoke and dozens more took up two rows of chairs, lined the back walls of the Beckett/McGuire Meeting Room at the Williston Town Hall and spilled out into the narrow hall and down the staircase. 
“This feels like a milestone moment that signals that maybe our mantra of ‘ICE OUT OF VERMONT’ is not just rhetoric, but an actual possibility,” said Blaine Paxton, a resident of Burlington who was there for the second time in two weeks.
People cheered and thanked the board when the resolution passed, banging wooden spoons on the backs of metal pots. As Kenney predicted, they filed back out before the budget discussion began.
The resolution is tied to a pair of ICE facilities in Williston that host digital surveillance and national tip lines. Less than two miles apart, they’ve been for months a target for local activists, who have protested ICE activities with noise demonstrations, banner drops and marches, including one with about 300 demonstrators who blocked traffic in the bitter cold Tuesday. The protest ended minutes before the board meeting. 
The surveillance activities out of the Williston facilities include investigations by the National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center on Industrial Avenue, which runs probes of U.S. residents based on social media and communication platforms like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, along with long-forgotten networks like MySpace and Tumblr, according to an October work order. 
The resolution states Williston “strongly objects” to having any Vermont facility used “for the warrantless surveillance of online activities, and other monitoring of Vermonters.” It is unclear  whether the resolution will have an impact on ICE activity in the state.
Hallquist said she wrote the resolution because she fears the rise of ICE’s surveillance strategies – especially when combined with artificial intelligence – “threatens the First Amendment rights of Vermonters to engage in political dissent and peaceful protest.”  
She circulated the resolution through activist networks like Vermont’s Indivisible group to towns across the state, hoping the generic language meant other communities could follow Williston’s lead. 
She compared the mobilization across the country to other historic actions like the Civil Rights Movement or ongoing protests in major cities facing a sudden influx of federal law enforcement agents like Minneapolis. The resolution mentions the death of Renee Good, a mother killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis on January 7, as a reason to oppose ICE.
Kenney, the board chair, said that while he favored the concept, the state constitution could not legally impact federal law enforcement agencies like ICE. 
“I think what they’re doing is immoral and illegal, but it doesn’t violate state law because state law doesn’t apply to them,” Kenney said. 
Not all those in attendance at Tuesday’s meeting supported the resolution. Shawn Handy, a landlord in Essex, told the board that the resolution could put Williston in dangerous territory. 
“I’m not here to oppose ICE or be for ICE or anything else, but what I am here as is a property owner,” Handy said. “If we were to pass something that says whoever owns the property ICE wants to occupy, you can’t rent that space to them, that’s the same as a landlord discriminating against somebody because of their particular beliefs or anything else.” 
He cautioned it could open the town up to lawsuits from the federal government or owners of the property ICE wants to occupy.
Even a board member pointed out the resolution was imperfect. 
The resolution’s first line states that the “Town of Williston is founded upon the principles of the United States Declaration of Independence, which holds that all persons are created equal and endowed with unalienable rights to Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” 
But the resolution’s flaw could be seen on a quilt, bordered with wildflowers, that hung behind the select board. Below a pair of cardinals, an apple tree, a bell, and the town’s historic red meeting house, the year of the town’s charter, 1763, was stitched in black thread. Williston was founded 13 years before the declaration. 
“We weren’t founded on the principles of the U.S. Declaration of Independence,” Kenney said. “If anything, they were probably founded on us.”

WILMINGTON, Del. — Two Wilmington-based startups, Aternium and GradBridge, have been recognized by the Philadelphia Business Journal as part of its annual “Companies to Watch” list, a regional snapshot of early-stage firms showing strong growth potential across the Greater Philadelphia area, including Delaware.
The list, curated by PBJ’s innovation and venture capital team at PHL Inno, highlights companies that are gaining traction through fundraising, leadership strength, market relevance and economic impact. While PBJ does not publish a formal scoring system, the list consistently features young companies with clear momentum and credible paths to scale.
Both Delaware firms operate in sectors drawing national attention — clean energy and financial technology — and are headquartered in Wilmington.
Aterninum – Clean energy focus
Founded in 2023, Aternium is developing compact hydrogen production plants designed to serve the Mid-Atlantic region. The company aims to produce low-emission hydrogen while minimizing waste streams, positioning itself within the emerging clean hydrogen economy.
The state of Delaware invested $1 million in Aternium to support engineering and feasibility studies tied to proposed hydrogen facilities. Company plans call for multiple plants across Delaware and the Delmarva Peninsula, with long-term investment projections reaching into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
Aternium is also affiliated with the MACH2 hydrogen hub, a multi-state regional effort focused on clean hydrogen development, though federal funding for hydrogen hubs remains subject to policy and budget decisions.
Founder Andrew Cottone previously co-founded Adesis, a Delaware-based specialty chemical company that was later acquired by Universal Display Corporation, providing Aternium with leadership experience and a proven track record in scaling science-driven businesses.
GradBridge – Fintech addressing student lending gaps
GradBridge, also based in Wilmington, operates in the financial technology and higher-education lending space. The company is preparing to launch a new private student loan product aimed at upper-level undergraduate and graduate students who are academically strong but narrowly miss traditional credit requirements.
The company announced a $20 million Series A funding round in October, led by Acorn Investment Partners, an affiliate of Oaktree Capital Management. GradBridge expects to begin offering loans for the Spring 2026 academic semester.
Founded by former Sallie Mae executive Jen O’Donald, GradBridge is targeting what it describes as a major gap in the student lending system, as more than one million students are denied private loans each year despite being close to graduation.

A new Alpine extension, CD-8, is provoking objections because of its proposed location: two miles from the Iñupiaq village of Nuiqsut. (ConocoPhillips)The Iñupiaq village of Nuiqsut has contended for decades with the westward expansion of oil development on Alaska’s North Slope.
Oil rigs have cropped up along the horizon, and industry roads now cut across the tundra just beyond the village.
The industry’s growth has been lucrative for Nuiqsut’s Indigenous-owned village corporation, Kuukpik, which owns land that’s coveted by multinational oil companies. But it also has provoked tensions among local leaders and some subsistence hunters and fishermen, who have objected to encroaching development.
Now, a proposal from one of the North Slope’s most prolific oil producers is driving a new conflict.
ConocoPhillips wants to drill wells and pump oil just two miles from the village, within clear view and potentially earshot of Nuiqsut’s center. The nearest existing drill site sits about five miles away.
Local leaders — even some who have historically supported and profited from oil production — say ConocoPhillips’ proposal is raising fundamental questions about the village’s relationship with the industry.
“There will be no way to ignore it, no way to pretend that Nuiqsut has not finally been overtaken by the oil fields,” George Sielak, Kuukpik Corp.’s president, said in an unusually pointed 17-page letter to federal regulators in October.
Since ConocoPhillips proposed the project, called CD-8, last year, it has garnered little attention outside Nuiqsut. But it continues to drive intense discussions between industry officials and tribal and corporate officials in the village of 500 people.
An oil ‘renaissance’ at a village’s doorstep
ConocoPhillips is a multinational petroleum company, headquartered in Houston. It’s a dominant player on the North Slope, producing about 170,000 barrels of oil a day there, and it is already planning to spend some $9 billion to build Willow, a huge new development west of Nuiqsut.
CD-8 would be the latest expansion of an existing ConocoPhillips field, called Alpine.
The project would involve building a new, 15-acre gravel pad on the tundra. From the pad, the company would drill wells to tap millions of barrels of oil in a geologic layer, the Nanushuk, that was overlooked by petroleum companies for decades.

A map of ConocoPhillips’ Alpine development and its existing and proposed extensions shared by the company with federal land managers.
Major discoveries in the Nanushuk in the past 10 years have led to an influx of investment and construction across Alaska’s oil patch, including both Willow and another huge field currently being built near Nuiqsut.
Beyond the CD-8 project, where ConocoPhillips would produce oil that’s already been discovered, the company is also planning extensive exploratory work to find new deposits in a nearby area this winter.
The North Slope oil “renaissance,” as some observers have labeled it, is poised to reverse the longstanding decline of crude flowing through the trans-Alaska pipeline.
The industry’s revival in the region could add to local and state coffers, and create new revenue streams for the North Slope’s Indigenous-owned corporations.
But the simmering tensions over CD-8 show how the rejuvenated industry still must navigate complex dynamics with the Alaskans who live closest to it, many of whom still depend on hunting and fishing for food.

ConocoPhillips is “working collaboratively and cooperatively” with regulators and stakeholders to analyze its proposal and alternatives, company spokesperson Dennis Nuss said in an email.
The company “remains committed to ongoing engagement with local and regional stakeholders to ensure their input is considered and questions are addressed,” he said.
The CD-8 project is far smaller than ConocoPhillips’ new Willow development, which spurred fierce national debate before the Biden administration approved it in 2023.
But the new proposal looms just as large for Nuiqsut residents.
“It’s a big deal,” Sielak said in a recent interview at Kuukpik’s Anchorage office. “It’s on our land, and it’s not in the right place.”
A ‘significant’ amount of oil
In permitting documents, ConocoPhillips says CD-8 could produce as much as 90 million barrels from up to 40 wells. At its peak, the project is estimated to produce some 32,000 barrels, valued at roughly $2 million at current prices, each day.
The estimated volume at CD-8 is only about 15% of what the company expects to produce at Willow, which is expected to start pumping oil in 2029.
But it’s still “a significant amount of oil,” said Mark Myers, a former state natural resources commissioner and former head of the U.S. Geological Survey. The crude is also “high quality,” he added, because it’s relatively light and easier to produce at high rates.
CD-8 is one of several new developments in the region targeting the sandstone and other rocks of the Nanushuk layer, about a mile underground.
It’s “necessary” to access oil that ConocoPhillips discovered in 2018 and that can’t be reached from the company’s existing infrastructure, according to Nuss, the company spokesperson.
The proposed drill site is near the boundary between ConocoPhillips’ oil leases and separate leases owned by an Australian multinational petroleum company, Santos.
Santos is building its own huge oil field called Pikka, which is expected to start producing from the same Nanushuk formation later this year.
The Pikka oil reservoir was initially identified by Texas wildcatter Bill Armstrong in 2013, in what was the first Nanushuk discovery.
Since Armstrong’s success, a string of additional discoveries in the Nanushuk have shown it to be a “very, very prolific” formation, Myers said.
“This is part of the larger play,” he said of the CD-8 proposal.
Some experts estimate that the Nanushuk, which extends well beyond CD-8 and Pikka, contains billions of barrels of untapped oil.
‘New and different questions’
Oil pumped from CD-8 would generate profits for the state of Alaska and the Indigenous-owned corporation for the whole North Slope, Arctic Slope Regional Corp.
Those two entities jointly own the area’s underground mineral rights and would receive what’s known as a royalty share of the value of oil ConocoPhillips produces.
Kuukpik, Nuiqsut’s village corporation, is also poised to benefit because it owns the surface of the land where ConocoPhillips is proposing to build its 15-acre drilling pad.
Kuukpik has long done lucrative business with ConocoPhillips, leasing land to the oil giant and performing contract work to generate profits for its some 700 Indigenous shareholders. Annual dividends to those shareholders have exceeded $30,000 in some years.
Since ConocoPhillips started to develop the area more than two decades ago, Kuukpik’s leaders have become known as savvy negotiators seeking to strike a balance between resource extraction, protecting the environment and preserving subsistence traditions.

In past years, they have fought some aspects of industry proposals and prompted companies to modify their development plans — in some cases by limiting construction or adding components, like a boat launch, to benefit the village. They’ve also endorsed some projects outright.
But CD-8, if built as proposed, would be different from any previous development near Nuiqsut, Sielak said in his October letter to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It would raise “new and different questions — questions that go to the very core of what daily life will be like in Nuiqsut,” he added.
Sielak and other local officials worry about noise and light pollution and other environmental and health effects of drilling so close to the village.
The pad would sit near a river channel where many community members hunt and fish, and within a half-mile of an 80-acre Native allotment — a piece of private property owned by a local family — that’s used for subsistence.
“You’ve got to ask yourself, thinking about your grandkids: Do you want your kids to see a drilling rig right outside your window?” said Sielak, who lives in Nuiqsut but was in Anchorage this month to meet with ConocoPhillips.
Elected leaders of Nuiqsut’s tribal government did not respond to a request for comment. They have said publicly that they’re opposed to the project, given its proximity to the village.
While Kuukpik’s leaders have concerns about ConocoPhillips’ initial plans for CD-8, they say they are waiting to take a formal position until the oil company weighs all of its options and produces a more complete proposal.
For now, Kuukpik is pushing ConocoPhillips to consider several alternatives to its preliminary proposal — each involving drilling in a different location, farther from Nuiqsut.
But ConocoPhillips’ ability to drill at different sites may be complicated by the boundaries of the company’s leases. Three of the four alternatives suggested by Kuukpik in its letter to regulators could involve drilling on nearby land leased not by ConocoPhillips but by Santos — and in recent years, the two companies have publicly feuded over access to North Slope infrastructure.
A Santos spokesperson did not respond to questions about Kuukpik’s suggestion that ConocoPhillips and Santos work together to mitigate impacts on Nuiqsut.
Nuss, the ConocoPhillips spokesperson, would not say whether his company would consider collaborating with Santos on CD-8.
Kuukpik has been discussing CD-8 with both ConocoPhillips and Santos, said Andy Mack, the Native corporation’s Anchorage-based chief executive and a former state natural resources commissioner.
“It will be interesting to see whether Conoco is actually flexible in their approach,” said Mack. “If you go back 25 years ago and look at the plans and the statements that were made then, nobody imagined that they would build a drill site two miles from the community.”

Becky Hadlock’s attorney says lawmakers lacked the legal authority to subpoena his client, making the case against her invalid. The court was unswayed.
The post Judge rejects effort to toss criminal case against Weston County clerk appeared first on WyoFile .","The criminal case against the Weston County clerk accused of defying a legislative subpoena will proceed after a judge rejected Wednesday an attempt by her attorney to have the matter dismissed.
Defense attorney Ryan Semerad had argued the Wyoming Legislature’s Management Audit Committee acted outside the scope of state law when one of its subcommittees subpoenaed Becky Hadlock. The subcommittee was investigating her actions related to a miscount during the November 2024 general election. 
Semerad maintains the subpoena was invalid, and he asked Natrona County Circuit Judge Kevin Taheri to toss a misdemeanor charge against Hadlock now rather than let the matter proceed to a jury trial.
Taheri was unconvinced. After a nearly hour-long hearing Wednesday morning in Casper, the judge concluded the committee possessed the authority to subpoena witnesses as part of its inquiry into Hadlock and the election errors.
“I don’t think it is the place of the court to second-guess the Legislature’s motives,” Taheri said.
Hadlock faces a single count of failing to appear for a subpoena, which carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $100 fine. Her trial is set for next week, but Semerad told WyoFile after the hearing that he planned to seek a pause in the case while he asks the district court to consider an appeal of Taheri’s decision.
Prosecutors in Natrona County filed the charge against Hadlock after she failed to appear before the legislative subcommittee when it met Sept. 29 in Casper.

The Legislative Service Office — the staffers for state lawmakers — contacted Hadlock during the first half of that month regarding the hearing, and she responded that she could not attend due to a scheduling conflict, according to her attorney. She was subpoenaed anyway on Sept. 23, but did not attend the hearing or make a legal effort to quash the subpoena.
In the aftermath, lawmakers on the subcommittee said they would pursue criminal charges. Hadlock in November pleaded not guilty.
Legal authority?
Ahead of the trial, Semerad asked Taheri to decide the matter now in Hadlock’s favor by ending the prosecution, maintaining that only questions of law, rather than the facts themselves, are at issue.
During Wednesday’s court hearing, Semerad argued the legislative subpoena was invalid because the Management Audit Committee lacked the statutory authority to investigate Hadlock. State law, he said, limits the committee’s authority to conduct audits of state-level agencies via the Legislative Service Office. 
More specifically, state law doesn’t allow the committee to investigate county-level officials or conduct inquiries into election misconduct, Semerad told the court. Possible violations of the state’s election code are the purview of the Wyoming Attorney General or local authorities, not the Management Audit Committee.
“It did not have this power,” Semerad said. “It should not have done this. And now, we are left to pick up the pieces.”

Natrona County Chief Deputy District Attorney Blaine Nelson asked Taheri to allow the case to proceed to trial. The committee, the prosecutor said, was not pursuing a criminal case when it subpoenaed Hadlock. Instead, it was investigating policy matters tied to elections, which is within its statutory purview.
Hadlock had proper notice that she needed to testify, even if only to tell the lawmakers that she needed legal counsel before proceeding, Nelson explained. Instead, she didn’t show.
“She failed to appear for the hearing,” he told the judge. “That is the case here.”
Hadlock attended Wednesday’s hearing, but did not speak. She listened to the proceedings from the defense table near the front of the courtroom and left soon afterward. 
Removal proceedings
The embattled clerk faces more than a criminal charge. Earlier this month, Gov. Mark Gordon directed the Wyoming Attorney General to seek her removal from office, alleging she “committed several acts of misconduct and malfeasance.” Gordon cited her failure to appear for the legislative subpoena and her filing of a “false audit report” after the election.
On the night of the 2024 general election, initial results showed a dramatic undercount for Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, who was running unopposed. It appeared that most voters in that race had chosen not to cast their ballots for him, despite the lack of another candidate.
That undercount resulted from an initial miscount caused by Hadlock’s use of the wrong ballots. Secretary of State Chuck Gray intervened, and a hand count ultimately produced the correct results.
But some in Weston County and elsewhere were disturbed by Hadlock’s handling of not only the election itself, but also the post-election audit she later filed. Gordon noted in his decision to seek her removal that Hadlock “failed to discover twenty-one incorrect ballot entries,” which “could likely be construed as misconduct or malfeasance.”
Gordon lacks the authority to unilaterally remove Hadlock from office. Instead, Attorney General Keith Kautz will seek her removal through a court proceeding.

The governor had been asked before to seek Hadlock’s removal over the voting snafu. But in May, he concluded her “serious mistakes” did not rise to the level of misconduct or malfeasance. His position changed after new public complaints were submitted stemming from her failure to appear for the subpoena and filing of an inaccurate post-audit report.
The committee, meanwhile, produced its own report on the matter, recommending four draft bills, including one that would increase the monetary penalty for failing to obey a legislative subpoena from $100 to $750. Another would create penalties for submitting false post-audit results to the Wyoming Secretary of State, who oversees elections.

West Columbia attorney Robert Bolchoz will become the next chairman, Gov. Henry McMaster said Wednesday.

2026-01-12 Judge Shedd to Governor McMaster re Resignation 
McMaster appointed Dennis Shedd, a retired federal judge, to the role in 2024. The job was always supposed to be short-term, Shedd said Wednesday during a regularly scheduled commission meeting.
“Somebody asked me why I was grinning yesterday, once I handed my letter to the governor, and I told him I was prepared to retire,” Shedd said.
Shedd expected to stay in the job for less than a year, long enough to ensure the 2024 presidential election went smoothly before returning to retirement, he said.
But trouble kept coming.
“It was more turmoil and a lot more work than I thought,” Shedd said of his time at the agency.
“At one point, I didn’t know who I could even talk to and trust at the agency,” he added.
In September, the commission fired then-executive director Howard Knapp, followed soon after by his deputy director, Paige Salonich.
Knapp was arrested in October on charges of embezzlement and misconduct in office related to his use of state-provided vehicles in 2023.
Problems went further than the criminal charges, Shedd said previously. Shedd accused Knapp of misrepresenting a $32 million contract for new voting machines to commissioners, leaving the agency with a bill higher than the board expected to pay.
However, Shedd signed off on a budget request for that amount. The chairman later said he didn’t read the ask, despite putting his name on it, and claimed that wasn’t part of his job.
Meanwhile, the agency faced a lawsuit from a voter attempting to stop the release of voter data to the U.S. Department of Justice. The federal agency sought all information on the state’s voters, including names, birthdays and drivers’ license numbers, which the lawsuit claimed violated the state constitution’s privacy guarantees.
Negotiations are underway on an agreement with the federal government over what voter information the agency will release, he said, though he declined to give details.
The agency’s troubles that kept Shedd there are over, he said.
“I thank Judge Shedd for his willingness to step in and answer the call to serve during a critical period for the State Election Commission,” McMaster said in a statement. “His steady leadership and guidance were exactly what our state needed and played a key role in maintaining the public’s confidence in our elections.”
Shedd trusts the agency’s new director, Jenny Wooten, and the rest of the staff, he added. Under Wooten’s leadership, the board received more reports about the agency’s activities than before, and he felt confident that path would continue, he said.
“I think (agency staff) will continue to do what we’ve done: always try to do what’s reasonable, what’s right and what’s in the best interest of South Carolinians,” Shedd said. “That ought to be the motto or something for this agency, because that’s what they do.”
Wooten praised Shedd for his work at the agency, saying the staff would miss his leadership but understood he wanted to spend more time with his grandchildren.
“You set the standard for integrity and accountability, and you leave us with big shoes to fill,” Wooten said.
Bolchoz’s term will begin Thursday.
A longtime attorney with experience in the local solicitor’s office and the attorney general’s office, Bolchoz was previously appointed by McMaster to lead the board overseeing the state Department of Health and Environmental Control. Bolchoz stepped down in December 2022, citing a new business opportunity.
His departure also came amid legislative efforts to break up the agency. Under a law passed in 2023, DHEC split into two separate agencies for public health and environmental services, starting July 2024. Both were put directly under the governor’s control, dissolving the board. Then last year, the Legislature passed a law merging several other public health agencies.
Also on Wednesday, McMaster appointed Angela Stringer, a member of the Anderson County elections board, to fill a vacancy on the state commission. Former commissioner Linda McCall left the board in September, saying in a resignation letter that she couldn’t focus on her work because of personal matters.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_3177-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-21 14:58:14.324446

Carter Nordman, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, held a news conference Jan. 21, 2026 unveiling House Republicans' property tax proposal. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)House Republicans released their property tax plan Wednesday, starting down the path toward finding a compromise with the governor and the GOP Senate majority on one of their top session priorities.
House Speaker Pat Grassley and Rep. Carter Nordman, who chairs the House Ways and Means committee, unveiled House Study Bill 596 Wednesday. It joins the list of property tax bills to be considered this year, alongside Gov. Kim Reynolds’ proposal announced in her 2026 Condition of the State address and Senate Republicans’ proposal released last week, Senate Study Bill 3001.
Nordman said House GOP lawmakers crafted their legislation with a focus on “real, tangible relief for all homeowners.”
“While there may be three different proposals out there right now, I am confident that we’ll be able to find common ground and accomplish property tax reform this year,” Nordman said. “… This plan prioritizes the taxpayer over the taxing entities. It brings simplicity, it brings transparency, and most importantly, it brings relief.”
There are some similarities between the House proposal and the governor’s plan, such as a 2% revenue cap for local governments outside of new construction, with exemptions for school funding and the debt levy. Both bills also call for a focus on finding local government efficiencies and ways for local entities to cut spending.
There are also several differences. While the governor’s bill includes a $10 million pot of one-time money for localities to finance consolidation and shared service agreements, the House bill does not have a funding mechanism to support this effort. Instead, it tasks the Iowa Councils of Government (COGs) to provide assistance with “coordination, planning and technical assistance for local government entities for the purpose of consolidating, sharing or regionalizing services.”
Grassley said COGs have already worked extensively with local governments on economic development, and said these boards were identified as a good “conduit” for working with local governments across a larger region on consolidation efforts. He also said he believes there is not necessarily a need for the fiscal backing included in Reynolds’ bill, as these changes will be driven by the revenue cap.
“Some communities have done really good with efficiency, so I’m not just blaming them in this conversation, but I’m saying with the ability to continue to collect more and more revenue, the incentive to find efficiencies, I don’t think is always taken as seriously as (it should be),” Grassley said. “So I think with that revenue gap, it will just naturally lead to more efficiencies. ”
Both the governor’s and Senate’s proposals also include a measure specifically lowering property taxes for seniors. Reynolds’ bill proposes freezing property taxes for seniors age 65 and older in homes valued at $350,000 or less, while the Senate bill goes further, eliminating most property taxes for Iowans over age 60 who no longer pay a mortgage for their home.
The House bill takes a different approach, proposing a new $25,000 exemption for all residential properties. This provision, which would mean all properties are not taxed for the first $25,000 in assessed home value, will help Iowans at all stages in their life, Nordman said.
“It gives relief to seniors, it gives relief to the working families, it gives relief to young couples who are buying a new home,” Nordman said. “So rather than just looking at one section, we’re given relief to everyone.”
The House proposal also requires bonds payable through property taxes to receive a 60% vote of approval to pass, in addition to adding new requirements on information sent to property taxpayers explaining how the tax money is used.
This bill does not include any of the measures related to changing Iowa’s “rollback” system of calculating property taxes which appeared in the Senate GOP proposal, as well as property tax plans introduced by legislative leaders in 2025. Grassley said the House Republicans’ goal was to introduce a “simplified” property tax plan in comparison to previous discussions, which is why the caucus settled on advocating a 2% revenue cap.
Grassley said as the conversation on property taxes progresses, he does not see any specific points in the House bill as “deal breakers” if they are not included in a final draft. Negotiations are ongoing, he said. He added that he did not know how a consensus will be reached, but the fact that the House and Senate GOP’s and governor’s proposals are all out early in session shows that all three parties are serious about taking action on the issue this session.
“Ultimately, regardless of what the process is, our goal is to find a situation where we can find certainty for the taxpayer,” Grassley said. “So however we get there, I’m not as concerned about. But we are already engaged in those conversations.”

Jim Lucas, R-Seymour, listens to a bill on March 31, 2025. (Photo by Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)After an attempt to add firing squads to Indiana law stalled in the Senate, a House panel on Wednesday passed a bill expanding the state’s execution methods.
Firing squad and nitrogen hypoxia would be allowed alongside lethal injection to carry about Indiana’s death penalty under a bill that passed 8-5 out of the House Courts and Criminal Code Committee.
House Bill 1119 was amended and now moves to the full chamber. Under the measure, it would be up to the Indiana Department of Correction to choose the manner of execution and state employees could not be forced to participate.
The vote was party line with Republicans in support except for Rep. Jennifer Meltzer, who joined Democrats in opposition.
“It provides options which are much needed in today’s environment,” said Rep. Jim Lucas, R-Seymour, the author of the bill. “Five states currently use both of these methods. Alabama has used nitrogen hypoxia for almost a decade. These methods have passed court muster in other states and they have been validated. That is the purpose of what I want to do with existing Indiana law is to bring it up to speed.”
Nitrogen hypoxia deprives inmates of oxygen using nitrogen gas. Alabama adopted the method in 2018 and used it for the first time in 2024. Five states — Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma — autho­rize exe­cu­tion by nitro­gen hypox­ia and only Alabama and Louisiana have used it.
Death row inmate Joseph Corcoran executed for quadruple murder

Indiana had a 10-year gap in executing prisoners due to the state’s inability to acquire the lethal injection drugs needed. In 2024, the state switched to a single drug — pentobarbital — and has since executed three men. But the drugs are expensive, as much as $300,000 a dose, and several doses have expired unused.
No one testified in support of the legislation while the Indiana Catholic Conference, American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana and the Indian Public Defender Council opposed it.
Several speakers noted it is illegal in Indiana to euthanize an animal using gas but this bill would allow a human to essentially be suffocated.
Under the bill, an execution by firing squad would be carried out by a trio of individuals chosen by the warden. “Each individual shall fire a weapon containing live ammunition. No blanks may be used,” according to the bill.
It also eliminates the requirement that an execution occur “before sunrise.”
Zach Stock, with the public defender’s office, said the overwhelming costs of a death penalty case are defending and prosecuting it — not the execution itself. He said the issue of availability of drugs is overstated, noting that 47 executions were conducted nationally in 2025 — 80% using lethal injection.

And he pushed back against another argument for the bill — it helps the federal government.
The federal death chamber sits in Terre Haute. Federal law allows flexibility beyond lethal injection based on methods authorized by states.
“This bill appears to be in response to a request from the White House, rather than a demonstrated long term need in Indiana,” Stock said. “Our position on this is that Indiana should not permanently alter its execution laws to accommodate a federal request that may change with the next administration. And the federal request is premised on the flimsiest of needs. There are only three people on federal death row … if they really want firing squads, they can move the chamber to Utah or South Carolina or somewhere that authorizes it already. The federal government has its own authority and its own responsibility to address its own execution protocols.”
Roarke LaCoursiere, speaking on behalf of Indiana’s Catholic bishops, said the imagery of a gas chamber and firing squad “highlights the brutality and savagery that the death penalty itself is and legalizing these new methods would only exacerbate the harm that having the death penalty in modern times already does to society.
“We believe Indiana should not pursue these execution methods, as they do not align with building a culture of life.”
A similar bill in the Senate stalled in committee after testimony. Corrections and Criminal Law Committee Chairman Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, declined to take a vote on the legislation Tuesday, and doesn’t have another meeting scheduled. The bill dies for this year if it doesn’t gain committee approval by Monday.

(Edwards campaign photo)A state appellate judge from Tangipahoa Parish announced Wednesday she intends to run for a vacant seat on the Louisiana Supreme Court. 
Judge Blair Downing Edwards, a Republican who sits on the First Circuit Court of Appeal, said she will enter a special election to replace Associate Justice Will Crain, who was recently confirmed as a federal judge, in District 1. 
In 2024, Edwards was elected to the First Circuit without opposition after holding a judgeship on the 21st Judicial District Court, which covers Tangipahoa and Livingston parishes, since 2008. She was the court’s only juvenile judge during that stretch and worked as public defender in the 21st District before her election to the bench. 
Edwards is a graduate of Nicholls State University in accounting and earned her law degree from Loyola University in New Orleans.
“I am running for the Louisiana Supreme Court because our state deserves justices who are independent, rooted in conservative principles, and strong enough to stand their ground when it matters most,” Edwards said in a statement. “I have never wavered in my belief that the Constitution and the law — not politics or pressure — must guide every decision.”
She is the wife of former five-term Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff Daniel Edwards and sister-in-law of former Gov. John Bel Edwards, both Democrats. 
“My parents and grandparents raised me to be a strong conservative, even while surrounded by folks with opposing views — even family — and I’ve never lost my bearings,” Blair Edwards said. “Some call it stubborn; I call it backbone. I stand my ground, aim straight and keep a sense of humor about it …”
District 1 for the Louisiana Supreme Court includes all of Livingston, Tangipahoa, St. Washington, St. Tammany and St. Bernard parishes and the easternmost section of Orleans Parish. 
Qualifying for candidates in the special election is happening on an emergency timeline. Gov. Jeff Landry issued a proclamation to give candidates until Jan. 30 to collect 150 signatures from voters in the district.  The same rules apply for a vacancy on the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education created when President Donald Trump picked Paul Hollis to run the U.S. Mint. 
If a registrar validates the signatures, the candidates can officially qualify Feb. 11-13 to be on the ballot for the closed party primary on May 16. A party runoff, if needed, is set for June 27, with the general primary on Nov. 3.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Edwards-Supreme-Court-1024x749.jpg,,,2026-01-21 13:57:56.578774
,Mississippi Today,2026-01-21 18:42:39+00:00,Mississippi Today,Public health lawmakers take steps to spend Mississippi opioid settlement money to study ibogaine,Allen Siegler,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/21/mississippi-opioid-money-ibogaine/,"Rep. Sam Creekmore, chair of the House Public Health and Human Services Committee, speaks during a press conference on ibogaine at the Mississippi State Capitol in Jackson, Miss., on Thursday, Aug. 28, 2025. Mississippi lawmakers are considering whether to fund clinical trials of the drug as a treatment for opioid addiction.","The Mississippi Legislature took steps early this week to change how elected officials spend tens of millions of opioid settlement dollars, money that state leaders have said can be spent on any public purpose.
Attorney General Lynn Fitch and state lawmakers created plans over the past four years to allow for roughly a third of Mississippi’s opioid funds to be spent on non-addiction expenses. That portion of the settlements, money won in lawsuits against companies that contributed to thousands of Mississippi overdose deaths, is split evenly between the Legislature and 147 local governments. Most states do not allow any opioid settlement money to be spent on anything unrelated to addiction. 
Over three years since Fitch’s office received the first check, the Legislature hasn’t spent the money it deemed discretionary yet. But at Tuesday’s meeting held by the House Public Health and Human Services Committee, lawmakers approved a bill to create a pathway to fund mental health clinical trials related to a drug called ibogaine. 
Republican Committee Chair Sam Creekmore of New Albany said he expects the state to appropriate $5 million of this money to fund the trials with Mississippi residents. Creekmore, the bill’s lead sponsor, has been encouraging his fellow lawmakers for months to use state dollars to study the psychedelic drug’s mental health treatment potential. 
In August, he invited speakers from across the country to encourage Mississippi to invest in the trials that examine how the drug could address opioid use disorder, traumatic brain injuries, post traumatic stress disorder and other mental health conditions. 
While some preliminary studies have indicated ibogaine could be helpful for treating these ailments, a review of available evidence says past ibogaine trials related to opioid addiction had “high risk of bias.” The drug has also been linked with severe side effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias. Some scientists say that risk can be mitigated by taking magnesium simultaneously. 
At Tuesday’s meeting, Department of Mental Health Medical Director Dr. Thomas Recore said he didn’t think ibogaine would be a “miracle drug” for all mental disorders.
“I’m in support of this proposal, that we continue to investigate this medicine as a potential for several of these options,” he said. 
Clinical trials are usually funded by private groups or federal organizations under the National Institutes of Health. But Arizona and Texas have passed bills to use public dollars for ibogaine studies, and Creekmore said Mississippi’s potential investment may help make the studies stronger. 
“If we can work together, that’s a really good start for this potentially world-changing drug,” he told his fellow committee members. 
The bill does not explicitly call for using opioid settlement funds. Instead, it says funds will be “specifically appropriated by the Legislature to the department for the purpose of this act.” After the meeting, Creekmore said he thinks the settlement dollars that can be used for anything would be the best funding source for the trials.
John Read, the Republican House Appropriations A Chair, did not respond to multiple calls and a voicemail asking whether his committee would look to use opioid settlement dollars for Creekmore’s bill. 
Creekmore’s ibogaine bill tasks the Mississippi State Department of Health with creating a state partnership with a university, a pharmaceutical company and a hospital. If the trial makes a profit, it says the state will get 20% of the profits. 
The bill also instructs the partnership to apply for two special designations from the Food and Drug Administration. One is a process that expedites drug development for treatments that have a “clear advantage over available therapy,” and the other allows people to transport Schedule 1 drugs, like ibogaine, legally across state lines. 
State lawmakers may soon be making changes around how the local opioid settlement money gets spent as well. In September, a Mississippi Today investigation found that much more of this money had been used for routine government expenses than addressing addiction. 
Some cities and counties shifted their spending to address addiction after the investigation, but others are still looking to use money for unrelated purposes. In October, Creekmore said he would propose a bill to encourage local government leaders to use money to prevent and treat opioid addiction in the 2026 regular legislative session. 
After Tuesday’s committee meeting, Creekmore said he submitted that legislation before the deadline to file bills. He said it should be available for the public to see shortly. 
The opioid settlements require roughly two-thirds of Mississippi’s money to be spent on addressing addiction, and those funds have also been unspent over the past three years. A state advisory council solicited and made recommendations on funding for opioid-related grants last fall, and the Legislature will decide which of those applications to approve later this session.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28121913/3X0A6031.jpg,,,2026-01-21 13:57:56.578774

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — An aide to the secretary of state warned lawmakers Tuesday that moving all local elections to even-numbered years, so that candidates for city, county and school board seats appear on the same ballot as candidates for president or governor, would have consequences for voters and election officials.
The proposal is among numerous changes to election law sought by Rep. Pat Proctor, a Leavenworth Republican who chairs the House Elections Committee and is running for the GOP nomination for secretary of state, which administers elections. Proctor said moving elections to even-numbered years would improve voter turnout, which a voting rights advocate pointed out was at odds with Proctor’s record of making it more difficult to participate in elections.
Clay Barker, general counsel for the Secretary of State’s office, said during a hearing before Proctor’s committee that combining elections would “exponentially increase” the number of ballot versions printed, to account for the boundary lines of small offices, such as school board seats and drainage districts.
He also said the ballots would be much longer, costing more to print and leading to longer lines at the polls as voters take more time to fill them out.
“The county will have to decide, do we handle that extra time and number of voters by having more polling places, more equipment and more staff, or do they make the strategy to push advanced voting, either in person or by mail, perhaps even sending out” advanced ballot applications, Barker said.
Counties also would have to figure out how to handle primary ballots, where only registered Republicans and Democrats can vote in their party’s races while nonpartisan elections would be conducted at the same time.
Additionally, Barker said, voter fatigue from long ballots could result in simply voting along party lines based on information provided by special interest groups.
Proctor responded by asking Barker why he identified his testimony on House Bill 2452 as “neutral.”
“You talked a lot about concerns and challenges,” Proctor said, “and I’ll dig into it with the clerks, because they’re the ones that do this day to day. Secretary of State’s Office has no position on the value of increasing voter turnout for an election?”
Barker said the office “would always be in favor of more turnout.”
“At the same time, I was just trying to make sure you were aware of some of the implementation issues,” Barker said.
If passed, the law would take effect in 2028.

Partisan flair
Only four people testified in support of the bill — two Republican legislators and representatives from two right-wing, out-of-state groups. Forty-three Kansans submitted opposition testimony.
Katherine Bennett of the American Legislative Exchange Council spoke in favor of the bill but asked that her testimony be re-labeled from “proponent” to “neutral” because of the organization’s nonpartisan nonprofit status. Rep. Alexis Simmons, a Topeka Democrat, questioned the authenticity of the move.
“Were you invited to the committee, or did ALEC seek this out?” Simmons asked.
Bennett said she was invited.
“And is that perhaps why you did not register as a lobbyist?” Simmons asked.
Bennett responded: “As a 501(c)(3), and as vetted by our lawyers, the testimony before you today was considered neutral from a 501(c)(3) organization.”
“Well, for the record, I think anyone involved in elections knows ALEC is highly partisan,” Simmons said.
Proctor has a history of promoting partisan-based changes to election law, including restrictions to early voting he engineered last year. He has said he would prefer to eliminate early voting and complained that women stole the 2022 election on abortion rights after seeing them in long lines at polling places ahead of Election Day.
On Tuesday, Proctor’s committee advanced House Bill 2446, which would drop the requirement that a treasurer’s name appear on a candidate’s political advertisements, and House Bill 2438, which bans non-government websites from assisting with voter registration applications.
The committee is scheduled on Thursday to hear House Bill 2451, which would prohibit public employees from advocating for or against proposed constitutional amendments while on the clock or with public resources. There is an exception for office holders who are seeking reelection or, like Proctor, a party nomination for office.
Voters in August will consider rewriting the Kansas Constitution to elect Supreme Court justices and abandon the current merit-based selection process.

Bitter fruit
Rep. Steve Huebert, a Valley Falls Republican, told the committee about how he had tried to move elections to even-numbered years more than a decade ago when Republican Gov. Sam Brownback was in office.
Huebert said he was driven by the need to increase turnout in local elections. But, he lamented, special interest groups fought the idea. As a compromise, the Legislature narrowly passed legislation that instead moved local elections from March to November in odd-numbered years.
“I remember being told by the governor, ‘Great job — you got half an apple.’ I jokingly told him, ‘Yeah, we got the half the apple with a worm in it, because it’s not going to accomplish its goal,’ ” Huebert said.
Ballotpedia writer Spencer Richardson provided voter turnout numbers for the committee that illustrate the stark discrepancy between local and statewide elections. Voter turnout in Kansas is 62% during presidential years, 46% for midterms and 20% in off-years, he said.
But numerous opponents questioned whether voters would be more likely to know anything about local candidates, even if turnout improved.
Harvey County Clerk Rick Piepho brought sample ballots for local elections that were already two full pages long for a single precinct. Merging elections would increase voter confusion, he said.
“It will increase the total number of votes for a candidate, because there’ll be people that wouldn’t make the effort in an odd year to go vote for a city election, that will actually mark a candidate if they were combined,” Piepho said. “But it’s not proven whether they would be an informed voter or not, whereas, at least the ones that are turning out now, I would say, are probably informed, because they’re making an effort to come vote in an odd year.”
Simmons, the Topeka Democrat, asked Piepho if he had any recommendations for how else they could increase voter turnout. Piepho said turnout is determined by what’s on the ballot.
“That’s my favorite testimony today,” Proctor said. “Turnout is determined by what’s on the ballot, and if you only have a handful of local races, you get less turnout.”

Getting out the vote
Voting rights advocate Melissa Stiehler, of Loud Light, told Proctor’s committee she was “thrilled that you all care about voter turnout.”
“That isn’t typically something that’s a priority in a lot of the bills that you all hear and work in this committee,” she said.
Stiehler said Loud Light was opposed to the bill because there were too many unknowns. She said she was worried about the effect on local issues as candidates worked to get out the vote.
“Do you think that your local school board member is going to effectively be able to run a GOTV campaign with getting donors and volunteers in comparison to the presidential race?” Stiehler said. “Do you think that your pothole is going to get the attention that foreign policy gets in that election?”
She said it may be difficult for candidates to find printers for their mailers, and costs will rise for ad time, if local and statewide elections were held simultaneously.
“Making major electoral changes that will impact every Kansas voter, that will impact every elected official, deserves the due diligence of finding out the facts and evidence and legislating based on that,” she said.
Shannon Kimball, a Lawrence school board member who testified on behalf of the Kansas Association of School Boards, said the organization has a longstanding policy of asking the legislature to keep school board elections nonpartisan and in odd-numbered years.
“We have maintained that position in belief that public education is best governed by locally elected citizens who are committed to serving their communities and are not accountable to partisan political structures,” Kimball said.
Rep. Paul Waggoner, a Republican from Hutchinson, asserted without evidence that “many people will not run for school board races because so few people vote.”
Kimball rejected his assertion.
“They run not because they are excited about the process of campaigning or partisan politics. They run because they really care about our public schools,” she said.
Waggoner’s response: “For the fact of the matter, there’s plenty of people on school board elections who could not win a higher office, because a higher percentage of people in their community who actually voted, that such a person would not receive a majority.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1200002-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-21 13:57:56.578774

Tom Osborne, R-Neb., testifies against legislative efforts to legalize online sports wagering on Wednesday, July 31, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen is looking to add a single exception in state law to put his old football coach in the Nebraska Hall of Fame early.
State Sen. Dan Lonowski of Hastings introduced Legislative Bill 1159 Tuesday on behalf of the governor. It would create a carveout allowing one living person to be included in the Nebraska Hall of Fame who meets several criteria that describes only former Huskers coach Tom Osborne.
The criteria include:

The person must be a prior member of the U.S. House of Representatives;


Be a former head coach of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln football team;


Have served as athletics director of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln; and


Have attended Hastings High School

Under state law, members of the Nebraska Hall of Fame must have been dead for at least 35 years.
That means if LB 1159 passes, Osborne, 88, would make history as the first and only living member of the Hall of Fame.
The standard process for adding a new member to the Hall of Fame typically lasts about five years, as state law dictates that no more than one new member can be added every five years.
There are now 27 members of the hall, whose busts are displayed in the Capitol. The last inductee was slain civil rights leader Malcolm X, an Omaha native whose bust was installed in 2024 after a years-long fight to include him.
Osborne, a member of the College Football Hall of Fame, was an influential figure in Pillen’s life. The governor has invited him to various special events he’s attended throughout his first term. Pillen played defensive back for the Huskers in the 1970s.
“Our state is indebted to coach and all the great things he has accomplished during his lifetime,” Pillen said in a statement. “It is time we recognize him appropriately, and I’m very pleased that an overwhelming majority of the Legislature agrees and that a bipartisan group is cosponsoring this truly wonderful, unifying bill.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
LB 1159 includes an uncommonly long list of 32 co-sponsors, including both Republicans and Democrats. One cosponsor was State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, who was part of the effort to induct Malcolm X.
McKinney said he signed onto LB 1159 because he doesn’t agree with the prerequisite that new inductees must be deceased for 35 years, and he believes the bill passing would make changing that requirement more likely.
“When you set a precedent, things in the future should hopefully change,” McKinney said.
Lonowski confirmed that the bill would create a special exception for Osborne, but he said the governor’s request has made him consider introducing separate legislation to change the wait to induct. He said he would favor reducing the prerequisite to just 10 years deceased, which was the requirement prior to 1998.
Lonowski argued that Osborne’s history — including his service in the U.S. Army Reserves and leading the Huskers football team to three national championships — makes him worthy of being added to Nebraska’s Hall of Fame despite not meeting the current requirements.
Lonowski described Osborne as “one of the greatest Nebraskans.” Osborne served Nebraska’s largely rural 3rd Congressional District in the House from 2001 to 2007. He also ran for governor, losing a close Republican primary to Gov. Dave Heineman in 2006.
Wednesday was the final day for senators to introduce new bills in the 2026 legislative session. Overall, 578 bills, resolutions and constitutional amendments were added to the record, along with nearly 500 carryover bills from 2025.
Here’s some of the notable bills that hit the books this year:

LB 960, by State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha — Provide a requirement to include nonvoting student members on school boards.


LB 973, by State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln — Provide free parking for state employees.


LB 984, by State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Bennington — Increase the minimum age for legal marriage in Nebraska from the current age of 17 to 18.


LB 1023, by State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil — Eliminate the sales and use tax exemption for zoo and aquarium admissions.


LB 1053, introduced by the Education Committee at the request of the governor — Eliminate the prohibition barring suspension for students in pre-kindergarten through second grade.


LB 1066, by State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha — Require members of the Nebraska Legislature complete a civics assessment consisting of questions from the United States Naturalization Test within 90 days of taking the oath of office.


LB 1081, by State Sen. Glen Meyer of Pender —Require state agencies and political subdivisions to purchase flags made in the United States.


LB 1090, by Murman – Bar convicted felons from being eligible as petition circulators.


LB 1099, by State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair — Establish “Husker Red” license plates.


LB 1206, by State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha — Exempt income made by teachers, paraeducators and paraprofessionals from state income taxes.


LB 1237, by the Executive Board — Ban weapons and other “prohibited substances” from entry to the state Capitol. Banned substances would include explosives, paint and spray paint and other hazardous materials.


LR 304, by Fredrickson — Designate the Legislative Oversight Committee to review, investigate and assess the effect of child welfare efficiency practices on child safety and the quality of services provided by the Department of Health and Human Services.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-21 18:34:36+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont: Doug McCrory should ‘step back’ from Senate leadership,Ginny Monk and Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/21/doug-mccrory-step-back-senate-leadership-lamont/,Lamont said the potentially fraudulent spending at the Blue Hills Civic Association raised concerns and should prompt McCrory to 'step back.',"Gov. Ned Lamont called for Sen. Doug McCrory, D-Hartford, to “step back” from his leadership roles in the Connecticut General Assembly after a forensic audit showed McCrory used the Blue Hills Civic Association, a nonprofit in the north end of Hartford, to distribute millions of dollars in state funds to individuals and organizations of his choosing.
The audit, which was commissioned by the state Department of Economic and Community Development, found that McCrory dictated how Blue Hills spent more than $15 million that was given to the organization in the past five years. 
And the auditors stated that the nonprofit’s “willingness to process large payments without due diligence not only facilitated possible fraudulent activity but also exposed BHCA to significant reputational and legal risk.”
McCrory, who is also the subject of an ongoing federal grand jury investigation, did not immediately respond to a phone call for this story. 
But Lamont said the potentially fraudulent spending patterns uncovered at the Blue Hills Civic Association raised serious concerns and should prompt McCrory to “step back.”
During a press conference Wednesday, Lamont said the Senate should be “very strict” with McCrory.
“Look, as soon as DECD started hearing about some irregularities regarding Blue Hills, they put in place an audit,” Lamont said. “We got the results of the audit, and I think we’ve got to be really strict about this. I have zero tolerance for this type of stuff. I’m not sure he should stay in the positions he’s in right now.”
Lamont said he’d leave the consequences of the audit up to the Senate, but if it were him, he’d want the Democratic senator to “step back.”
Asked to specify whether he thought McCrory should step down from leadership positions or from the Senate entirely, the governor said, “I think he should step back.”
The Senate Democratic leadership, which has not made any public comment about the FBI investigation of McCrory’s role in grant making, had no immediate statement on the governor’s comments.
But Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said he concurred with the governor’s call for McCrory, at a minimum, to step back from any role in leading a committee or advocating for grants in the budget process. 
“That report is extremely damning and, unfortunately, based upon that, I don’t see how he can stay in office. At the very least I would suggest the Senate leadership of the Democratic Party strip Sen. McCrory of his committee assignments,” Harding said.
Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, has sole authority over whether to suspend McCrory as as committee co-chair or member. He was expected to meet with Lamont later Wednesday.
The governor said the state police could investigate, if necessary, to learn whether any state laws were broken in McCrory’s dealings with the nonprofit.
If the Senate decides not to take action against McCrory, Lamont said, “there’s an election coming up in less than a year.”
With more than two decades of experience in the legislature, McCrory holds significant sway in the General Assembly. 
He is currently a chairman of the legislature’s Education Committee. He is also a member of several state boards that are in charge of deciding how to spend millions of dollars. 
That includes the state’s Minority Business Initiative Advisory Council and the Community Investment Fund, which is in charge of divvying up hundreds of millions of dollars in distressed communities throughout Connecticut.
The audit commissioned by DECD covered more than five years of spending at the Blue Hills Civic Association, but many of the findings were focused on more than $1.7 million that McCrory and Blue Hill’s executive director directed to businesses owned by Sonserae Cicero.
Cicero is also a focus on the ongoing criminal investigation by the FBI, which is asking question about her relationship with McCrory.

Day has been serving as interim chief public defender for the agency since Bowden-Lewis was fired in June 2024. The Public Defender Services Commission, which oversees the Office of the Chief Public Defender, unanimously chose Day to continue in the role.
The Commission found in 2024 that Bowden-Lewis had accessed employees’ email accounts without permission, ignored the commission’s authority and engaged in a “pattern of misconduct” against employees, resulting in “a Division-wide climate of fear and intimidation.” 
Bowden-Lewis subsequently filed a federal lawsuit in which she claimed the commission discriminated against her because of her race. She is seeking back pay, benefits and attorneys fees. The case is ongoing. 
Public Defender Services Commission Chairman Richard Palmer told CT Mirror in a statement that Day had agreed to postpone his retirement for 18 months. He said this would give Day the opportunity to complete projects that he began while serving in his interim role. 
“We are pleased that John is willing to do so and look forward to working closely and cooperatively with him in the best interest of the division over that 18-month period,” Palmer said. 
The Office of the Public Defender Services has struggled in recent years to find staffing as pay rates stagnated. In 2023, the state raised the income threshold that allows people to qualify for public defenders from 200% to 250% of the federal poverty level, increasing the office’s potential number of clients. The legislature has raised the hourly rate of assigned counsel to $98, but it remains below the federal hourly rate of $177 and below that of other New England States.
Because of a shortage of attorneys, the agency has fallen short of its own standards for child welfare visits, leading to a request to hire 20 additional social workers.

Ben Adams, R-Nampa, introduces a proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution that prevents the state from selling future public lands it obtains from the federal government. (Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)An Idaho state senator on Wednesday introduced a proposal to amend the state constitution to protect public lands acquired by the state from the federal government. 
Sen. Ben Adams, R-Nampa, first announced his proposal in August, well ahead of the 2026 legislative session that began this month, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. He unveiled the draft text of the amendment later that month. 
Idaho legislator unveils text of proposed constitutional amendment to protect public lands from sale

Adams told the Senate State Affairs Committee on Wednesday that since unveiling his proposal, he’s had conversations with residents and industry leaders all over the state. 
“I wanted feedback. I wanted a lot of feedback, because it deals with a very personal matter for every Idahoan, and that is our public land here in Idaho,” Adams said. 
He said he slightly changed the text from his August proposal, but “the intent did not change.” 
 What would the constitutional amendment do? 

If approved by the Legislature, the proposed constitutional amendment would go to voters on the November ballot. It would ask if the Article IX of the state constitution should be changed to say that new land acquired by the state from the federal government could not be sold, and would be managed in way that “avoids permanent impairment to the land, ensures the development and utilization of the land and its resources, preserves valid existing rights, and is in accordance with state law.” 
Constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and Senate to go on the ballot. Once the question is on the ballot and goes to the voters, it would require a simple majority to pass. 
The amendment would not apply to the state’s 2.5 million acres of endowment land, which can be sold. 
Under the amendment, land acquired or purchased from the federal government would be held in a trust in perpetuity. Revenue derived from the lands would go into a fund, which would be used first to pay for operating and maintaining such lands, then to compensate counties for lands within their boundaries that are in the trust and not generating property tax revenue. The revenue would also then be used to improve public use and access, and to support public K-12 school facilities. 
Senate Minority Leader James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, said Wednesday he would vote to introduce the bill, but when it came back for a public hearing, he’d like information about how much it would cost for the state to manage lands acquired by the federal government.

 State management of Idaho federal lands has been a discussion

Nearly two-third of Idaho’s land mass, or more than 34 million acres, is federally owned and managed. Some Idaho officials have suggested that the state should take over ownership or management of these lands. U.S. Congressman Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, sent a letter to state and local officials in December to explore local control of federal lands, the Sun reported.  
However, fellow Idaho Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson in May co-sponsored federal legislation that would prohibit the sale or transfer of large swaths of public federal lands, the Idaho Press reported. Simpson told the Idaho Press that while there have been talks regarding Idaho taking over federal lands for years, the price tag had made it unrealistic, and it would come with a loss of federal money used to offset lost property taxes in jurisdictions with large areas of federal land. 
The Senate State Affairs Committee Wednesday unanimously voted to introduce the joint resolution, which clears the way for it to return to the committee for a public hearing at a later date.

Kevin Stitt during a World Economic Forum Panel. (Screenshot via World Economic Forum livestream)Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear unabashedly showed how his style of governance differs from Republican President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum Wednesday. 
The forum annually held in Davos, Switzerland, brings together world leaders and corporate CEOs to talk about the global economy. Trump spoke to the conference after Beshear’s appearances Wednesday morning, and in it ruled out using force for the U.S. to gain control of Greenland from Denmark. 
In a conversation with fellow Democrat, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and Republican Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, Beshear was critical of the president’s governance, including his recent threat of military action to quell protests in Minnesota following a federal agent killing a woman and the insistence of U.S. control of Greenland.
“This Greenland play by the president is dumb as hell,” Beshear said. He added that the policy proposal “is so damaging, so concerning, and this is not who we are” and was unfavorable with Americans. 
Beshear was also part of a discussion on closing manufacturing gaps in the U.S. and globally through education on Wednesday. He is also scheduled to discuss the middle class’ lack of growth since the pandemic in a Thursday panel. 
Seen as a possible candidate for the 2028 presidential election, the appearance at the forum gave Beshear a chance to highlight his knowledge on international policy in front of a global crowd. 
Following Trump’s speech to the forum, Beshear posted on BlueSky that the president’s remarks were “dangerous, disrespectful and unhinged.” 
“From insulting our allies to telling struggling Americans that he’s fixed inflation and the economy is amazing, the President is hurting both our families’ financial security and our national security,” Beshear wrote. “Oh, and Greenland is so important he’s calling it Iceland.” 
In response to a comment from Stitt defending Trump’s America first policies when it comes to bringing jobs back to the U.S. and Whitmer saying “it’s going to take us a long time to recover from” the president’s first year back in office, Beshear said: “An American first president wouldn’t be saying, we’re going to make Venezuelans rich. We’re going to pay people in Greenland $100,000 while our people struggle to pay their bills.”
Beshear also lauded lawsuits he joined that successfully brought federal funding back to Kentucky after the Trump administration revoked it. The lawsuits have been led by Democratic attorneys general, but some Democratic governors in states with Republican attorneys general, like Beshear, have joined them throughout the past year. 
“Yes, he tries, because he’s willing to be that bully on the playground, but we push back, we stand up, and we’re winning,” Beshear said. 
The panel’s moderator, Richard Quest of CNN, introduced Beshear by saying ChatGPT had called the Kentucky governor “the future hope” and “the next leader” when asked for background information about Beshear. 
Nevertheless, Beshear also took the opportunity to highlight the Bluegrass State on an international stage. He touted Kentucky’s economic strengths, such as logistics as the state can reach many Americans within a night’s drive and has two of the largest cargo airports in the world. 
Back in Kentucky
Beshear’s international travel in recent months, including attending last year’s World Economic Forum, has been criticized by Kentucky Republicans. 
Earlier this week, the Republican Party of Kentucky issued a statement saying Beshear was “once again off rubbing elbows with global elites in Switzerland.” 
“The Governor loves to lecture everyone else about bipartisanship, transparency, and focusing on the ‘real issues,’ but when it’s time to lead, he disappears,” RPK Communications Director Adam Hope said. “Kentuckians deserve a governor who shows up and does his job.” 
The GOP-controlled General Assembly began the 2026 legislative session this month. Among bills filed so far, Rep. T.J. Roberts introduced House Bill 86, which would require Kentucky governors to request tax dollars for international travel from the state treasurer, who is currently Republican Mark Metcalf. Roberts filed similar legislation last year. 
Roberts told the Lantern Wednesday morning that he wants to “make clear” to Beshear and those who follow him in office that they “have to be good stewards of tax dollars” and should make a case for international travel to someone who is not appointed to them. The process now requires the governor’s office to submit requests to the Cabinet for Economic Development. 
When asked if he sees the value of elected officials in general traveling internationally for economic development, Roberts said that should be reviewed on a “case by case basis.” He added that in his view, it would be more beneficial for businesses considering investing in the state to travel to Kentucky instead and “get a feel for our culture” and the people they would be investing in. 
“I just think that there’s an appearance of impropriety whenever the governor’s going on trips that cost more than the average Kentuckian makes in a year right along the time where it’s abundantly obvious that he’s going to run for president, and when you look at what the World Economic Forum has become, it’s clearly a political institution,” Roberts said. 
The Lantern filed an open records request with the governor’s office for receipts of international travel for Beshear and his staff in 2025. According to records provided, the office spent $125,700 on travel for the governor, First Lady Britainy Beshear and staff across three trips abroad. 
The cost of attending last year’s forum was $44,400, which followed a $36,450 trip to Madrid, Spain, to meet representatives of Acerinox, the parent company of North American Stainless Steel, which is in Carroll County. 
In October, Beshear and his entourage traveled to the United Kingdom, France and Ireland, which cost $44,850. A press release from his office ahead of the trip said the governor and other members of his administration would meet with business and trade officials to discuss future opportunities for growth in the state. Airline ticket confirmations for that trip showed Beshear and those with him flew premium economy on British Airways. 
Asked about the criticism, Beshear spokesperson Scottie Ellis defended the governor’s travel, saying international trips have “helped secure some of Kentucky’s most significant economic development investments in our history.” Late Democratic Gov. Martha Layne Collins’ trip to Japan led to automaker Toyota building a Georgetown plant in 1986, which is now the company’s largest vehicle manufacturing plant in the world. 
Ellis said “strong international partnerships have played a significant role” in the economic successes Kentucky has seen under the Beshear administration. 
“Every Kentucky governor has traveled internationally for economic development trips, as has almost every constitutional officer and members of the General Assembly,” Ellis continued. “Targeting only Gov. Beshear shows the political motivation behind this bill, which would make Kentucky less competitive and risk our current economic success and job creation. In a recent international trip, a company said it would have moved to a different state but for the visit.” 
“The Kentuckians who still have those jobs today certainly support international travel,” she said.” 
Ellis added that the governor’s children only traveled on the October trip last year, and the Beshears paid for their travel personally.
A recent press release from the governor’s office said that while traveling to Switzerland, Beshear will also discuss other economic opportunities in Finland and Sweden this week.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-21-at-12.08.00-PM-1024x572.jpg,,,2026-01-21 13:57:56.578774

The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Dustin Manwaring, a Republican from Pocatello, said he’d been thinking about proposing the bill for years. His bill would bar employers from restricting public employees from communicating “in good faith” with state lawmakers, legislative staff or committees in the Idaho Legislature.

“This is really about good governance and government transparency,” Manwaring told the House State Affairs Committee before it introduced the bill Wednesday. 
The bill comes as the governor’s office has restricted state agency testimony on bills before the Legislature, and directed agencies to coordinate with the governor’s office before responding to questions from legislators and journalists. Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s chief of staff recently detailed the policy in a memo to agency leaders, which the Idaho Capital Sun obtained. 
Idaho governor tells state agencies to coordinate responses on legislators’, journalists’ questions

Manwaring’s bill would prohibit employers from taking or threatening “adverse action” against public employees for talking with legislators, and would ban employer policies that restrict “employee communication” with the Legislature. He said the bill would build on the state’s whistleblower law. 
Manwaring told the Sun in an interview that his bill isn’t in response to the governor’s office’s policy but that his bill would halt it. He said he was inspired to bring the bill by years of experience as a legislator and in talking to other lawmakers. 
“I’ve had enough personal experience with just having issues where I feel like sometimes we’re not getting the best information, or we would just get better information if this protection was in place for employees to just be able to talk to us freely,” he said.
In the coming days or weeks, the legislation could receive a full committee hearing with public testimony before it would advance to the House.

TOPEKA — Kansas penalties for livestock, grain and ranch equipment theft are significantly less than surrounding states, frustrating farmers and ranchers whose livelihoods are affected long-term, legislators heard Tuesday.
Multiple proponents spoke to the House Judiciary committee Tuesday about two proposals — House Bill 2413, focused on cattle and farm equipment theft, and House Bill 2422 on grain theft — sharing the sometimes long-term effects of agricultural theft. Several pointed out that Kansas penalties are less severe than surrounding states. 
No neutral or opponent testimony was submitted.
The two bills would increase the severity of penalties for theft to level 5 or 6 nonperson felonies and set new thresholds for implementing penalties. 
 
Cattle and implement theft
Jason Thompson, revisor of statutes office, summarized HB 2413 and changes that would

Define livestock as cattle and horses only
Change theft of livestock or agriculture equipment used in caring for livestock to a severity level 5, nonperson felony, no matter what the value of the stolen items; and 
Allow for the forfeiture of items used in the theft under criminal forfeiture procedures. 

Currently, severity of the crime is based on value, with increasing penalties depending on the value of the items stolen, Thompson said. 
Rep. Megan Steele, R-Manhattan, testified in favor of the bill, saying the issue came to light when two calves and a trailer were stolen from a friend. 
“This is an important and necessary step to address the growing problem of cattle and agricultural equipment theft here in Kansas,” she said. “This issue extends far beyond just the property issue, but it strikes at the heart of our rural communities, our rural agricultural communities that we have here in the state of Kansas.”
The criminal in her friend’s case was caught but received only a misdemeanor “slap on the hand,” Steele said, while her friend lost an entire year’s worth of income because of the cost of the trailer that had to be replaced. 
Sam Johnson, a rancher  and crop farmer in Wabaunsee, Lyon and Osage counties, told the committee that his small operation could be harmed by even a minor theft, which might be a misdemeanor under current law. 
“I am a small producer, so my cattle herd is roughly 40 pairs. Just the theft of a calf today, that calf goes to market to bring as much as $3,000, a mama cow over her productive life, well over $15,000,” he said. 
Theft of equipment, which in his smaller operation may mean the $20,000 tractor he uses to feed animals, can have long-term effects.  
“When I have to take care of my herd, if there’s a health issue or something like that needs to be addressed within my cattle, and those (implements) are gone or animals are stressed due to criminal activity, the impact is even greater to a small producer such as myself,” he said. “This bill is long overdue.”
Matthew Steele, CEO and executive director of the Kansas Cattlemen’s Association, told legislators that states surrounding Kansas have much harsher penalties for cattle theft. 
“It is easier to steal them in Kansas and get rid of them in Oklahoma. Why? Because it’s a slap on the wrist in Kansas, and when you go to Oklahoma, it’s a slap on the wrist for selling stolen property,” he said. “There’s a reason that they steal cattle in Kansas, because our penalty does not match our neighboring states and other neighboring cattle states.”
In Oklahoma, the penalty is a mandatory three to 10 years in jail per head stolen and up to three times the value, or $500,000, fine per head, Matthew Steele said. Some trailer loads of cattle stolen in Kansas would lead to a life sentence in Oklahoma, he said. 
 
Grain theft
House Bill 2422 would set the penalty for stealing crops at a severity level 6 nonperson felony and defines the theft of 400 bushels of grain as the threshold, rather than determining the penalty based on value, Thompson said.  
Valuing grain theft so that it meets current standards of value can mean the crime doesn’t rise to the level of a felony, testified Randy Stookey, senior vice president with the Kansas Grain and Feed Association.
For instance, a grain truck holds between 400 and 500 bushels of grain, whereas a semi-truck holds about 1,000 bushels. Assuming the grain is corn, which sells for about $4.50 per bushel, Stookey said someone would have to steal nearly six semi-trucks of corn before the crime would rise out of the level of presumptive probation.  
“That’s why these aren’t charged,” he said. “That’s why the prosecutor says, ‘Look, I’ve got drug crimes I’m dealing with. I’m not going to prosecute.’” 
Mike Smith, who recently retired as CEO of Ag 1 Source, testified about a situation that resulted in losses from theft. 
In the industry for nearly four decades, Smith said he was overseeing operations at a co-op where theft began gradually with a few hundred pounds of stolen grain and ended with a group of six people at several co-ops working together and stealing about 4,000 bushels. 
“They did end up prosecuting two of the six people that were involved in it, and the gentleman that worked for myself, he ended up spending more time in jail for a DUI that he got,” Smith said, adding that the man also was ordered to pay restitution of $52,000 and never paid anything. 
“To a small company, $52,000 is a big thing, and he got nothing but a slap on the wrist,” Smith said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/randy-stookey-20260120_161936-1024x753.jpg,,,2026-01-21 13:57:56.578774

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee Wednesday approved legislation that would prevent courts from extending youthful offender status to anyone between the age of 16 and 19 charged with murder.
HB 11, sponsored by Rep. Phillip Pettus, R-Killeen, reduces the threshold for youthful offender status for those crimes from 19 to 16 for those charged with murder or capital murder.
Pettus highlighted the 2023 mass shooting in Dadeville, in which four people were killed and at least 32 injuries. Five people, aged 16 to 20, were charged with murder in the shooting.

“There are instances when a juvenile gets youthful offender status, they only get three years max that they can serve in prison if they kill somebody, even under capital murder or intentional murder, the most they can get is three years,” Pettus said in an interview following the meeting of the House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee. “To me, that is not fair to the victims, the judge should be able to sentence them to more than three years.”
The measure was approved without discussion or objection from any legislators on the committee.
Currently, courts may order an investigation to determine if a minor charged with a crime should be given youthful offender status if the case is not in juvenile court and a person commits a crime of moral turpitude that carries a sentence of at least one year, as well as another charge that is less severe.
The legislation only applies to cases in which people were charged with either murder or capital murder and not other crimes. It sets an upper limit for any youthful offender status to 21 years old; the current statute refers to crimes committed in a person’s “minority.”
Pettus’ rule would not apply to those whose murder or capital murder charge is reduced to a less significant crime. He prefiled the legislation several months prior to the start of 2026 legislative session after the Legislature failed to enact the measure in the prior two years.
Alabama has been plagued by persistent prison overcrowding and violence. The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit in 2020 after investigating the conditions of people who are incarcerated in the facilities of the Alabama Department of Corrections.
The ADOC also has faced ongoing shortages of correctional officers that have contributed to the violence and the deaths that have happened during the past several years.
“Very little,” Pettus said when asked how his legislation would affect the issue of overcrowding in prisons. “There are not that many cases where juveniles are charged with it.”
Pettus said he wants to remove a procedural hurdle that delays court proceedings.
“It unties the court because they do not have the hearing to determine if a person should be given youthful offender status,” Pettus said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Phillip-Pettus-April-22-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-21 13:57:56.578774

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Just a day after U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow announced her plans to challenge U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a veteran state lawmaker has put his name up as her replacement in the House of Representatives.
Sen. Rick Edmonds, R-Baton Rouge, said in a statement he intends to run for the 5th Congressional District seat, which represents Northeast Louisiana and extends southward to include parts of the state capital. 
Edmonds, 69, has held a seat in the Louisiana Legislature since 2016, taking a spot in the Senate in 2023 for a district that includes parts of East Baton Rouge, Livingston and St. Helena parishes. His career as a Southern Baptist pastor has included affiliation with multiple congregations.
“Today, our nation faces serious challenges. The rise of socialism is taking hold in many of our major cities and threatens the values that make Louisiana strong,” Edmonds said in a statement announcing his candidacy. “In our state, we believe in hard work, faith, family, and limited government — and we need leadership with a proven track record to defend those principles.”
In the Louisiana Senate, Edmonds chairs the education committee where he has backed school choice proposals. Most recently, he carried legislation for Gov. Jeff Landry to create the LA GATOR program that seeks to use state dollars to fund private school vouchers. His colleagues in the statehouse, which has a supermajority of Republicans, have yet to fund the program to the level the governor desires.
Edmonds also sits on the Senate Finance Committee, which has to clear the state budget annually, as well as panels on insurance and criminal justice.
On his Facebook page, Edmonds lists himself as vice president of the Louisiana Family Forum, a leading conservative organization that supports anti-abortion legislation and backs a new state law requiring displays of the Ten Commandments in school classrooms.

I won't use force.""But he signaled any European country that objects to the U.S. making Greenland part of the country will face repercussions, possibly the tariffs he threatened over the weekend. “You can say ‘yes,’ and we will be very appreciative, or you can say ‘no’ and we will remember,” Trump said. Greenland would become the site of a missile defense system that Trump refers to as the Golden Dome, which he said could “keep our very energetic and dangerous potential enemies at bay” if the island becomes part of the United States. Trump bashes NATOTrump repeatedly criticized the other NATO countries during his speech, falsely claiming more than once the United States has never benefited from the military alliance formed following World War II. ""What we have gotten out of NATO is nothing, except to protect Europe from the Soviet Union and now Russia,” Trump said. “I mean, we've helped them for so many years.""The United States is the only country in the history of the alliance to invoke Article 5, which says that an attack against one is an attack against all.That led NATO countries to send their military members to fight alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan following the 2001 terrorist attacks.

It's just not fair to the public. They're not able to buy a house,” Trump said. “And I'm calling on Congress to pass that ban into permanent law, and I think they will.”Trump said he wanted to take steps to help Americans afford homes, but that he didn’t want those actions to reduce the value of homes people already own. He didn’t elaborate on how that would work. “I am very protective of people that already own a house, of which we have millions and millions and millions. And because we have had such a good run, the house values have gone up tremendously, and these people have become wealthy. They weren't wealthy.

Trump wrote he would increase the tariffs to 25% in June if a deal hadn’t been brokered before then.Trump wrote in his most recent social media post that further negotiations about Greenland will be handled by Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and several other officials. “Additional discussions are being held concerning The Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland,” Trump wrote, referring to a possible missile defense system. “Further information will be made available as discussions progress.”‘I don’t have to use force’Trump insisted during the 75-minute, wide-ranging speech he gave a few hours before his announcement that Greenland represents “a core national security interest” that “would greatly enhance the security of the entire” NATO alliance if it were fully controlled by the United States. “I'm seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States,” Trump said. “Just as we have acquired many other territories throughout our history, as many of the European nations have … there's nothing wrong with it.”Trump signaled he will likely not use the U.S. military to take over Greenland, saying, ""I don't have to use force.

And they did in Afghanistan, as you know,” Rutte said, according to audio of the exchange shared by the White House pool.Rutte noted that for “every two Americans who paid the ultimate price, there was one soldier from another NATO country” or Australia. “So you can be assured, absolutely, if ever the U.S. will be under attack, your allies will be with you. Absolutely. There's an absolute guarantee,” Rutte said. “I really want to tell you this, because this is important. It pains me if you think it is not.”Trump told reporters ahead of his meeting with Rutte that he “could see” paying a price for Greenland, though he did not elaborate. He said he had “no idea” when he might speak directly with leaders of Denmark about trying to acquire Greenland.

Norwich University has appointed Lea Williams as provost and dean of the faculty, the university announced in a press release Tuesday. 
Williams was appointed to serve as acting provost in May and then as interim provost in August. In her new role, she is expected to act as the chief academic officer, overseeing academic programs, faculty affairs and institutional learning initiatives, according to the press release. 
“Dr. Williams has demonstrated, time and again, that she understands the heart of Norwich University — our faculty, our students, and our mission,” Norwich University President Lt. Gen. John Broadmeadow said in the press release. “Her appointment as Provost reflects both her exceptional qualifications and the trust she has earned across this institution.”
Williams has also served as faculty development coordinator, department chair of English and communications, and interim dean of two colleges during her 20 years at the university. 
The appointment comes amid years of instability and controversy in the university’s leadership. Former President Mark Anarumo stepped down in 2024 after an investigation into his alleged violation of unspecified school policies, according to the university. Then-Provost Karen Gaines stepped up to serve as interim president before leaving to serve as provost at Oklahoma City University. 
Last March, Williams was accused of “abusive and harassing behavior”  in a lawsuit from a former faculty member, Montpelier City Councilor Pelin Kohn, against Norwich University. Kohn claimed that Williams berated Kohn, excluded her from meetings and ignored her emails while the two of them worked at at Norwich, according to the complaint. The lawsuit is still in the discovery phase, according to recent filings. 
Marc Kolb, the university’s associate vice president of campus and athletic communications, said Wednesday that the university does not comment on personnel actions. He added that the university was confident in Willams’ leadership and her commitment to serving her students.
Williams, who is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, did not respond to a request for comment. 
Williams joined Norwich University in 2006 after previous teaching stints in South Carolina, Oregon and Tours, France. As a professor of English and communications, she specialized in teaching the literature of war, according to the press release. 
Williams said in the press release that the academic program remains strong despite the different leadership changes. 
“That can feel destabilizing, but the reality is the foundation is super solid,” she said in the press release. “The faculty are continuing to deliver a great curriculum and all sorts of excellent experiences for our students.”

In a joint press conference on Wednesday, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, reemphasized the importance of the legal battles that they have taken up, alongside many of their Democratic colleagues, in the last year against the Trump administration.
Kaul called the work of the attorneys general as acting as a “critical buffer in stopping some of that chaos from impacting people in our communities.”
Democratic attorneys general, including the three at the press conference, have secured 22 active injunctions against Trump administration policies, as well as eight total court victories, Nessel said, adding that in Michigan, that has resulted in more than $2.2 billion being either returned or preserved for the state. 
Raoul added, pushing back on criticism that these court cases are attacks on the administration’s policies and going beyond the scope of an attorney general, that the cases are based on the fact that the Constitution and laws already passed are being violated by Trump. 
Status report: Michigan’s federal lawsuits against the Trump administration

“If it were just simply policy differences, I might use my voice to speak out against the policy difference, but I would not be in the courtroom fighting,” he said. “But in these instances, our Constitution and our laws have been violated, and that’s why we fight.”
In Michigan, legislation introduced by House Republicans in December and passed by the GOP-led House Judiciary Committee would seek to limit the attorney general’s powers to intervene in lawsuits, including those she has taken up against the Trump administration. 
Nessel said in the press conference that she is “confident that those efforts will not be successful,” adding that many Republicans who she talks to are “relieved that we brought those lawsuits and relieved that we won them,” after learning more about the impacts of the federal policies in question. 
“It didn’t matter if you were a Democrat, a Republican, an independent, man, woman, parent, every single one of us would have been impacted,” Nessel said. 
Kaul said, referring more broadly to attempts to limit the power of state attorneys general, “This is not what democracy is about. We have a clear set of rules, and the people get to choose who exercises those offices.”
“The reality is, what’s happening is the administration is blatantly and willfully violating the law, and so when we step in, we have been able to get what’s considered extraordinary relief, relief stopping the administration from going forward in case after case, because what it’s doing is so clearly unlawful,” Kaul added. 
Nessel also said that she has been working with state and local law enforcement to prepare for future actions by ICE or other federal law enforcement agencies in Michigan, especially following the recent, violent deployment of ICE agents in Minnesota. 
“Much of the conversation revolves around, how do we protect communities all over the state from illegal actions, abuses, violations of civil liberties by federal agents, which is a really sad statement to make,” she said. “I’m going to be doing everything I can to work with other members of law enforcement to ensure that we are protecting the public from these illegal actions by the federal government. It’s intolerable, and we need to fight as hard as we can to protect against those kinds of abuses.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-21-at-10.07.11-AM-scaled-e1769014179505-1024x562.png,,,2026-01-21 12:57:58.665242

States are pushing to prevent the use of artificially intelligent chatbots in mental health to try to protect vulnerable users. (Photo by Shalina Chatlani/Stateline)A key proposal from Gov. Ron DeSantis aimed at shielding Floridians from the growing power of artificial intelligence unanimously cleared its first committee hurdle Wednesday.
Called the “AI Bill of Rights,” the 23-page legislation bans companion chatbots — AI systems that mimic emotional connection — from speaking to minors without parental consent and requires bots to remind users that they are not human.
Personal data would be forbidden from being sold; people could not use AI to generate fake images or words of another without express permission; and state or local governments couldn’t use foreign-owned AI, the bill says.
“This bill is predominantly about protecting Florida’s children and vulnerable adults, as well as consumers,” bill sponsor Sen. Tom Leek, a St. Augustine Republican, said Wednesday morning.
He noted that although there’s more work to be done on the bill, his legislation is targeted toward consumer protection — “not the universe of things that could be done.” This was a response to criticism that he should also try to crack down on potential data breaches and outline protections for workers fearful that AI will take their jobs.
“So, when you see this bill next time, hopefully it will be tighter definitions and continue to be the product that it was designed to be, which is to protect children,” he added.
 ‘Jurassic Park’
The conversation surrounding AI has sparked hairline fractures in the GOP. On a national scale, President Donald Trump has embraced AI, forming close alliances with tech titans like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. The Department of Defense earlier this month announced that it would use an “AI first” strategy in defense systems, and integrated Musk’s chatbot Grok within the Pentagon’s networks.
Trump even signed an executive order in December invalidating certain state AI laws.
But DeSantis has offered cautionary tales against unfettered AI access. He’s toured the state for months, warning against an “age of darkness and deceit” AI could usher in. Although he’s confident Florida’s AI Bill of Rights won’t run afoul of Trump, it hasn’t stopped him from repeatedly criticizing “AI slop” and promising to protect Floridians from the technology.
SB 482 was borne of a host of suggestions pushed by DeSantis in December. Leek adopted many of these, including restrictions on AI chatbots that were “sexually grooming” children and, in some cases, encouraging suicide, as well as barring use of foreign AI services within Florida.
DeSantis suggested preventing Floridians from paying for the exorbitant energy and water consumed by AI data centers. That language has been placed into another bill, which passed its first committee on Tuesday.
The sweeping legislation was unanimously approved by the Senate Commerce and Tourism Committee, and received bipartisan commendation on its intent — although some encouraged Leek to take a closer look at protections for workers.
“Every time I think about this, I think about Jurassic Park,” said Rich Templin, AFL-CIO’s director of politics and public policy. “There was a message there. … There was a warning about technologies exactly like this. Just because you can do something doesn’t necessarily mean you should.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/chatbots.jpg,,,2026-01-21 12:57:58.665242

(Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A House lawmaker wants the state to run its own blood bank so it can provide Oklahomans blood “untainted” by the COVID-19 vaccine.
But medical professionals said it’s not reasonable to require blood banks to accurately screen donors for vaccination status. Scientifically, there’s no way to tell the difference between the antibodies of people who have been sick with COVID and those who have been vaccinated against it, one doctor said.
Rep. Justin Humphrey, R-Lane, said he authored House Bill 3196 to “start conversations” about how to best provide people with unvaccinated blood products, especially in emergencies. His measure proposes that the State Department of Health open a blood bank that receives and stores blood from people who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19.
Humphrey said he created this legislation after hearing a story about a child in state custody whose mother wanted any blood transfusions to be done with blood that had not received the COVID-19 vaccine. 
He said he’s suspicious of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, and believes some of his family were adversely affected by it.
“At the end of the day, I don’t want it,” Humphrey said. “I don’t want it in me. I don’t want a transfusion. I don’t want it.”
He said he should have the ability to receive blood from donors who are unvaccinated and is open to private sector solutions to this problem if creating state statute isn’t the right path forward. 
“If I’m in a wreck, if I need blood, I don’t want to wait till the last minute to know where we get COVID vaccine-free blood,” Humphrey said. 
Dr. Steven Crawford, a family physician, a faculty member at the University of Oklahoma and president of the Oklahoma Alliance of Healthy Families, said the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and does not “taint” or “contaminate” someone’s DNA.
“There’s absolutely no way it can do that,” he said. “These are people who know nothing about science, who know nothing about medicine, that are trying to provide medical laws that make no (sense.)”
Crawford said the legislation would be detrimental to blood banks. There is no way for blood banks to verify whether a donor has received the COVID-19 vaccine beyond asking them. Even an antibody test wouldn’t be able to differentiate between the donor receiving the vaccine and having antibodies from having COVID-19, Crawford said. 
“It would essentially shut down all blood banks because there’s no way they could comply,” he said. “So no one would get blood donations. They would get no blood for blood infusions, or blood product infusions, that save many, many lives.”
Blood donation and transfusions are regulated at the federal level to ensure safety, said Dr. John Armitage, president and CEO of Our Blood Institute, which operates the nation’s sixth largest blood center and works with over 240 hospitals and medical providers in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Texas. 
“There is no scientific evidence that a donor’s vaccination status affects the safety of donated blood,” he said.
Dr. Lance Watson, Mercy Hospital Oklahoma City’s chief medical officer, said it’s uncommon for patients to request vaccine-free blood.
He said federal guidelines allow for healthy people to donate blood regardless of their COVID-19 vaccination status.

Jim Pillen. Oct. 22, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, in a tele-town hall call organized Tuesday to tout his final proposals before a reelection campaign, made property tax relief his calling card and asked conservative Nebraskans to rally legislative support or send him three more votes in the Legislature.
In a sharpened tone that seemed aimed at riling up his base for a possible GOP primary, the governor criticized Democrats and the media and called some of his critics names while saying he prefers bipartisanship because Nebraskans are “tired of politics.” 
Pillen repeated his recent frustration with how some of his budget-cutting proposals are being covered, saying reporters have “bent” stories and won’t get the “facts out.” Most of Pillen’s proposals to cut about $500 million in state spending target the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, including a program paying for often in-home family caregivers of the elderly and people with disabilities, changes some lawmakers oppose.
Nebraska is trying to close a $471 million budget hole that has grown during an economic slowdown in agriculture and in the wake of Pillen seeking and passing stair-stepped income tax cuts that are about to finish phasing in at the same time he has increased state spending on local property tax relief. 
The governor calls the discussion of the deficit a “make-believe budget crisis.” Legislative leaders, including Speaker John Arch, have described closing the budget gap as the most important task facing the Legislature.

Pillen also recently faced questions over some of his handling of state funds, including an Examiner story that Pillen steered the Nebraska Department of Economic Development to award a $2.5 million no-bid emergency contract to a bioeconomy consultant and lobbyist he knew. The Governor’s Office touts hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funds the state gained. State Auditor Mike Foley argues the state should still have followed its own processes and law.
The call’s co-host with Pillen made plain the call’s tone with a question about how reporters had misled the public about progress under Pillen. He praised the governor for standing for conservative Nebraska “values.”  
“I don’t really give a damn what those libtards and these people that want to criticize, quite honestly, the more they criticize me and our team and my family, [I know] we’re doing good work,” Pillen said. 
The town hall host asked callers what the most important issues were for them during the 2026 legislative session. 
The options he gave callers were straight out of “The Pillen Playbook,” a campaign handout Pillen shared during the 2022 campaign and tweaked for 2026: “Protect our kids, fix the property tax crisis, defend Nebraska values, bolster Nebraska agriculture and winner-take-all.”

The host said listeners chose property taxes as the most important issue. Pillen said the people he talked to during his tour of the state want lawmakers “to solve problems” – pointing to what he called the “property tax crisis.” 
He said if people want “transformative” property tax reform, he needs three more legislative conservatives to “play ball on the team and make sure that we can broaden our sales tax so that there can be dollar-for-dollar property tax relief.” His talk of needing three votes could signal confidence in GOP pickup opportunities this fall in legislative races. It also could hint that the governor is looking to primary some legislative Republicans opposing his agenda. 
Property tax relief has been a top Pillen priority since the 2022 GOP primary. He and the Legislature have taken both incremental and significant steps, including making a billion-dollar investment in special education and a foundation or baseline level of state aid for K-12 schools. 
This year, Pillen has asked lawmakers for $170 million in property tax relief. He has said such an effort will require looking at eliminating some sales tax exemptions that lawmakers have balked at before. 
Pillen said he needs a second term to provide more property tax relief. 
“That’s why reelection is so critical,” Pillen said.
Several Republican operatives expect Pillen to draw at least one GOP primary challenger, partly because of local and national polling numbers that indicate the incumbent governor could be vulnerable. Multistate agribusinessman Charles Herbster has hinted he might challenge Pillen but has not announced a bid. Some have discussed another potential Republican challenger. 
But Pillen has a $10 million campaign war chest and the benefits of incumbency, so a challenger would need to raise a significant sum. On Wednesday, former State Sen. Lynne Walz announced a Democratic bid for governor.

Many of the Pillen call’s themes sounded similar notes from his State of the State address. He praised President Donald Trump, who has endorsed his bid, and touted his relationship with the president. He bragged about the state hosting a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility for migrants in McCook. He said the state is pushing back against diversity, equity, and inclusion in higher education. And he emphasized running the state “like a business.”
“It’s time we stand up and get rid of some of this stuff that’s invaded our state,” Pillen said. “It’s time we fight like heck for it.”
The host asked Pillen if Nebraska is becoming liberal. Pillen said Nebraskans “are so conservative and so straight … I don’t think we can curl our hair anymore.” He said Nebraskans still care about faith, family, hard work and the American dream. 
Then the governor said, “If you listen to the keyboard warriors that are libtards … you would think the sky is falling down.”
Some snickering and laughing could be heard in the background after Pillen said it. Pillen used the term two more times Tuesday evening. He called protestors who wear red robes and white bonnets “libtards” who have “lost their brains.” And, later, he made a similar comment about his critics and the press.

The state Department of Health stands by fluoridation as a step in treating public drinking water supplies, officials with the agency told Mississippi Today on Tuesday.
Last week, the state Public Service Commission unanimously passed a resolution advocating for the “removal of sodium fluoride additives in drinking water.” Water systems began using fluoride as a treatment measure to prevent tooth decay in 1945. 
Drinking fluoridated water reduces cavities by 25%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has called the practice one of the greatest public health interventions of the 20th Century. 
“MSDH encourages the use of fluoride for it’s health benefits, primarily for oral health,” Greg Flynn, a spokesperson for the agency, said. 
But a growing movement — championed by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — has seen places around the country remove fluoride from the treatment process. Last year, Utah became the first state to ban the practice.
“Mississippians deserve to know what is being added to their drinking water and why,” said Central District Public Service Commissioner De’Keither Stamps, who introduced last week’s resolution. “This resolution is rooted in transparency, safety and affordability. We want to help water systems reduce avoidable chemical costs while ensuring families have confidence in the quality of the water coming into their homes.”
In a handbook on water fluoridation, the Health Department’s Bureau of Water Supply states its position more firmly.
“While it is understood, based on peer-reviewed scientific research, and years of experience that (water fluoridation) is safe and effective, some public water systems within Mississippi choose to discontinue fluoridation, contrary to the guidance of public health professionals,” the handbook says. “In many cases, decisions are made by (water system) officials without receiving appropriate factual information or notifying customers of the public water supply about the loss of this public health benefit.”

Opponents also point to toothpaste with growing amounts of fluoride as a reason to stop using the additive in drinking water. But toothpaste isn’t a replacement for water fluoridation, the bureau adds in the handbook.
Neither the state nor federal government require water systems to use fluoride in their treatment.
In 2001, the Mississippi State Board of Dental Examiners came out in support of statewide fluoridation in drinking water systems. Its counsel, Westley Mutziger, told Mississippi Today the board hasn’t reviewed its stance on the matter.
Flynn, with MSDH, said two systems in Mississippi have completed the process of discontinuing fluoride treatment: Sunrise Utility Association, which serves 5,998 people in Forrest County, and the town of Louise, which serves 870 people in Humphreys County. As of last December, another 26 systems serving a combined 275,000 people were in the process of abandoning fluoride in their water treatment, according to MSDH:

City of Brandon, serving 31,548 people in Rankin County.
City of Greenville, serving 29,602 people in Washington County.

While the state doesn’t require fluoride in water treatment, it does require a water system to take certain steps before discontinuing the practice: 1) meeting in person with MSDH’s Bureau of Public Water supply, 2) giving a 30-day public notice, 3) the governing body holding a vote, 4) another public notice of the final decision, and 5) continuing to inform customers that the system has stopped using fluoride in its water treatment.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/05023727/3X0A6167-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-21 12:57:58.665242

House Study Bill 541 would have the Iowa Board of Regents study a potential performance-based funding model for the University of Iowa, Iowa State University and the University of Northern Iowa and submit a report to the General Assembly by its November 2026 meeting.
According to the bill, this funding model should factor in graduation rates, the number of awarded degrees corresponding to Iowa’s high-demand jobs, post-graduation employment rates and income and how many graduates stay in Iowa.

While the board of regents is registered as undecided on the legislation, board state relations officer Jillian Carlson said there are some concerns with what would need to be factored into the funding model. Post-graduation income is one she identified as potentially posing an issue, as the universities work to meet workforce needs in rural areas where income is often lower.
“I think we certainly understand your guys’ desire to look at these performance metrics, but we do have some concerns with the metrics in the bill, particularly where they would conflict with state needs,” Carlson said.
As the Iowa House Higher Education Committee is “looking to create efficiencies,” Carlson said the board’s budget, investment and finance committee is “currently working on an efficiency review of all of our revenue” — an effort headed by Regent Kurt Tjaden.
Members of the subcommittee said they were surprised and disappointed to see little public comment during the meeting, with Rep. John Wills, R-Spirit Lake, saying he’s noticed a lack of participation in other subcommittees he’s sat on during this legislative session as well.
Rep. Heather Matson, D-Ankeny, was the only lawmaker on the subcommittee to not support the legislation, saying so after Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, didn’t answer her questions on what a performance-based funding model would look like from his perspective as the person who filed the bill.
“I think it probably goes without saying that I’m not going to be signing off on the bill today, mostly because of a lack of engagement in a conversation on what this bill actually entails and how it will practically work in the real world,” Matson said.
She also took issue with the potential funding model’s criteria, some which she said are out of universities’ control. If a student decides to move away from Iowa because it is what is best for them and their family, she said a university could be penalized through the funding model even though they couldn’t do anything to change that outcome.
Collins said the bill would not enact a new system for universities to follow but “seeks to align taxpayer investment with taxpayer return,” and to gather additional information for the General Assembly to potentially act upon.
Iowa needs to evolve, Wills said, and the Legislature can’t just keep going with the status quo.
“We need to become more efficient,” Wills said. “We need to look and research other opportunities and other ways of doing business, because sometimes the status quo, the way we’ve always done it, is not the best way.”

Dec. 10, 2025 | Screenshot The Michigan House Health Policy Committee voted on Wednesday to advance a three-bill package — all unanimously supported by the committee members — that would divert certain misdemeanor defendants to assisted outpatient treatment for defendants with particular mental health concerns, as well as updating standards and procedures for referrals and mediation of disputes in patient treatment. 
In a December hearing of the committee, Judge Milton Mack, a retired Wayne County probate judge and state court administrator, as well as the chair of the Mental Health Diversion Council, explained that the state’s mental health code was “designed to wait for crisis before acting, which meant intervention often came too late.”
But with access to advanced outpatient treatment, as these bills would provide, Mack explained, hospitalizations and incarcerations have dropped significantly in counties that have already implemented similar policies, including Calhoun County and Genesee County.
“What this bill does is modernizes Michigan’s mental health code to reflect today’s clinical and public safety needs in which we’re confronting across the nation,” said Rep. Donni Steele (R-Lake Orion), who sponsored one of the bills. “This clarifies peace officer responsibilities of the individuals that are in protective custody and ensures timely clinical evaluation or intervention before a crisis may occur.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“We’re not waiting for imminent threat,” added Rep. Mark Tisdel (R-Rochester), a sponsor of another of the bills. “It’s that early intervention. Just think of it like cancer screening.”
The bills would also increase the availability of mediation options for resolving disputes over mental health treatment, which Mack explained generally reduces the number of times that courts are required to intervene in mental health treatment cases. 
Mack also responded to a question from Rep. Brenda Carter (D-Pontiac) about potentially increased financial burdens for patients, especially those who are uninsured, saying that the goal would be to reduce hospitalizations and avoid unnecessary costs. 
“What we’re doing is expanding the use of outpatient treatment to avoid hospitalization,” he said.  “The risk of unnecessary hospitalization is fairly low considering the fact that we’ve gone from 550,000 hospital events nationwide to about 30,000 nationwide.”
Kate Dahlstrom, the president of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Grand Traverse, expressed support for the majority of the content of the bills in the December hearing. Dahlstrom, however, also expressed concerns about exclusion of the individual and their families from decision-making power in treatment plans, as well as granting sole discretion to local community mental health agencies to determine which services to provide. 
“What these bills are going to do is enable families and providers of care to seek help before it’s too late,” Mack said. “The most important benefit is to the individual who suffers from mental illness, because early intervention and relying on community treatment is the best hope for recovery.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-21-at-10.15.52-AM-scaled-e1769008662446-1024x575.png,,,2026-01-21 11:57:11.107779

The National Weather Service is forecasting the potential for a massive winter storm from Friday until Sunday. The storm could reach north Mississippi, parts of the Delta, central Mississippi and down to Hattiesburg. While the forecast is still evolving, the potential exists for freezing rain and other forms of winter precipitation, coupled with freezing temperatures.
The weather could impede travel and cause power and communication outages. Freezing rain brings the potential of downed power lines and trees.
MEMA and NWS are working closely together in preparation for the storm. Scott Simmons, MEMA’s director of external affairs, gave some tips ahead of this weekend.
“People need to start thinking now about preparing their disaster kits, what they’ll need in the event that their house should lose power,” he said “Will they have batteries? Will they have phone chargers? Will they have the ability to heat their homes?”
Simmons said residents should make sure they have food, water, blankets and batteries in their homes and cars. He warned to never use a stove top or oven to heat a home, and to place space heaters in the middle of the room away from flammable objects. People should wrap their pipes, have plenty of firewood and seal their doors and windows to lock in the heat. 
NWS has a guide to help people prepare for winter weather, and MEMA has a guide for creating a disaster kit.
Subfreezing temperatures are expected to last through the weekend and early into next week, according to current forecast models. The National Weather Service recommends keeping an eye on the forecast as it changes.
Freezing rain can be especially devastating. In February 1994, much of north Mississippi experienced one of the worst ice storms in the state’s history, resulting in downed trees and power lines over wide areas. Power outages in some instances lasted more than a week and the state had to step in to help with the cost of cleanup and other recovery efforts.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/21101057/1.jpg,,,2026-01-21 11:57:11.107779

Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Wednesday called on the North Dakota Legislature to “execute the game plan” the state has put together to spend $199 million earmarked for rural health care. 
Armstrong, a Republican, used the opening of a three-day special session — with the primary purpose to decide how to use the federal funding — to deliver a State of the State speech at the Capitol. 
North Dakota had one of the highest per-capita funding awards among the 50 states in the first year of the Rural Health Transformation Program, with more to come. 

North Dakota Monitor special session coverage

“If we execute our game plan, we can continue to receive an outsized share of these federal dollars – nearly $1 billion over the next five years,” Armstrong said. 
Armstrong noted that funding for the second year of the program will start Oct. 1. 
“While we don’t know the amount yet, we are asking you to approve two years of appropriation authority to ensure that we can quickly disburse the second tranche of funding,” he said. 
The money was included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act as a way to offset cuts to Medicaid.

Armstrong identified four pillars to the state plan: Promoting healthy lifestyles to address physical and mental health; strengthening the rural health workforce; expanding access to health services through technology; using data to “create a health care system that is smarter, faster, and more responsive.”
Armstrong credited the state’s Rural Health Transformation Committee for identifying four proposed pieces of legislation that helped secure the funding: 
The bills seek to:

Require the Presidential Physical Fitness test for students
Require one hour of nutrition education for doctors
Join the physician assistant licensure compact
Expand what services pharmacists are able to provide

Armstrong called the federal funding a “generational opportunity” for North Dakota to improve how it provides health care to rural areas and revitalize communities.
The state has a short window to get the money out into the hands of communities. North Dakota has until the end of September 2026 to obligate the funding, and until September 2027 to spend it.
Armstrong noted that the plan doesn’t include new buildings or programs he said are not sustainable. 
The speech also did not mention other bills that Legislature will consider during the session. Those bills include emergency loans for hospitals, with Jacobson Memorial Hospital in Elgin in southwest North Dakota identified as being at risk of closure without state help. Two bills address the push for free meals for K-12 students. 
In his speech, Armstrong highlighted some statistics about North Dakota health care: 

Nearly 75% of North Dakota’s rural counties face primary care shortages. 
Almost half lack adequate dental care, and 17 counties have no practicing dentist. 
Mental health access is even more limited – 44 of our 53 counties are designated as shortage areas. 

By sticking to the game plan, “we can make North Dakota the healthiest state in the nation and the best place to live, work and raise a family,” Armstrong said.

States are trying to prepare for more widespread use of self-driving cars in the future with new laws (Mario Tama/Getty Images).The push to allow Waymo driverless taxis to operate in Missouri cleared its first hurdle Tuesday evening. 
The House Emerging Issues committee voted 7-4 Tuesday, along partisan lines, to advance two identical bills sponsored by Republican state Reps. Don Mayhew of Crocker and Brandon Phelps of Warrensburg.
The bills had received strong support from advocates for the disabled, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer, during a three-hour public hearing last week. 
But committee members heard fervent opposition from numerous Teamsters commercial drivers, who argued the legislation is a “job killer” because it opens the door for driverless trucks on highways.
The bill also faced opposition from first responders and school bus drivers, who raised public safety concerns. 
Tom Mullins, a St. Louis firefighter with Teamsters Local 610, said at last week’s hearing that other cities have struggled with keeping “robo taxis” out of emergency scenes or getting them to move to the side of the road when their sirens are on. 
“Delays in even seconds can make a life or death difference in property preservation and human survival,” Mullins said. “Emergency crews have had to physically intervene, smashing windows to force the vehicle to stop or physically stand in front of an autonomous vehicle to keep it from entering the scene.”
Lori Becker, CEO of the St. Louis-based Starkloff Disability Institute, urged the committee to think about people with disabilities and those who have “transit-limiting conditions.” Becker said she and others face challenges with Uber drivers and would feel “more safe being in a car independently.” 
“I don’t have to rely on someone’s judgment or availability or get their permission to get a ride somewhere — I can just go,” Becker said. “And that’s a right that we all deserve. So it’s about our rights, it’s about our dignity, and it’s also about putting more money back into the economy.”
Democratic lawmakers from Kansas City noted the legislation would prevent local governments from banning self-driving cars and services in their cities. All three Kansas City members of the committee voted against the bills. 
State Rep. Emily Weber, a Democrat from Kansas City, asked Phelps and Mayhew if they’d spoken with the city’s police chief about the impacts of the bill, specifically about training first responders to interact with the cars. 
“We’re having issues hiring police officers, first responders,” Weber said. “So now you’re adding additional new training, and it seems like neither one of you have had conversations with the areas that are going to be affected by this.”
Mayhew said that he’s had numerous conversations with the leadership in St. Louis. 
Representatives from the St. Louis mayor’s office spoke in support of the legislation, saying the city is already partnering with Waymo cars as a test site. Waymo is only allowed to test the cars in manual mode with a driver, until a state law is passed permitting driverless cars. 
St. Louis Democratic state Rep. Elizabeth Fuch voted against the bill. 
After St. Louis was announced as a test site, Waymo hired four Missouri Capitol lobbyists in November to help push for the legalization bill.
The legislation requires a law enforcement plan be submitted to the Department of Public Safety detailing how to communicate with a “fleet specialist” and how to take the cars off the road if needed. The vehicles must remain at the scene of a crash, as required by current law, and crashes or collisions involving autonomous vehicles must be reported. 
Autonomous vehicle taxis would operate under the same rules as taxis and other for-hire passenger transport systems, it states, and commercial vehicles would abide by commercial vehicle laws.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/selfdriving-vehicles.jpg,,,2026-01-21 11:57:11.107779

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)A measure that would expand the sealing of certain criminal history records has passed its first assigned committee in the Florida Senate.
Florida has a “one-time” rule that allows a person to seal an arrest record only once in their lifetime.
Three years ago, the Legislature overwhelmingly passed a bill that would have allowed an adult who had been arrested to expunge his or her criminal history related to a low-level incident. It only pertained to people who had their charges dropped, were found not guilty, or were arrested but not ultimately charged. It would not apply to domestic violence cases.
However, Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed it, in a move that stunned criminal justice reform advocates.
Undaunted, Sen. Corey Simon, R-Tallahassee, is back with a bill (SB 810) which would allow an individual who has had  multiple arrests that were dropped or ended in non-guilty verdicts to petition a court again following a three-year crime-free waiting period. The proposal would also allow an individual to petition a court to seal a misdemeanor offense that they were found guilty of as long as it was not of a violent nature and they have maintained a conviction-free record over five years.
“Florida is the only traditional Southeast [state] that does not allow more than one chance to seal any kind of record including arrest that did not result in a conviction or withheld adjudication, and is one of the most restricted states in the country in not  allowing a judge to consider sealing even a single low-level misdemeanor conviction after a waiting period,” Simon told the Senate Criminal Justice Committee on Tuesday.
The committee passed the measure, with only Sen. Jason Pizzo, an independent from South Florida, voting no.
A companion bill (HB 745) has been filed in the House by Rep. Traci Koster, R-Tampa.

(File photo/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — South Carolina steel companies are pushing a bill to require state and local officials to build all taxpayer-funded projects using U.S.-made steel and iron.
A House panel voted unanimously to advance the bill Tuesday after hearing from steel giant Nucor Corp., as well as American SpiralWeld, a company with operations in Columbia that turns Nucor’s steel into pipe.

“If we’re going to spend our taxpayer dollars, we would rather it come back to places like Darlington County,” said Republican Rep. Richie Yow, whose district covers a Nucor steel plant in Darlington.
The federal government has had U.S. production requirements for federally funded road projects on the books since the 1980s. Congress has tightened those mandates over the years, including most recently in the Biden administration’s massive infrastructure law.
Yow said the bill, which he sponsored, takes those federal requirements and applies them to the state.
Texas passed similar legislation in 2017, and Florida did the same last year. Legislators in the major steel state of Ohio are currently considering the measure, said Bill Paxton, a national lobbyist for the iron and steel industry.
Rep. Robert Williams, D-Darlington, raised concerns about how the measure might raise the cost of public projects, which already have ballooned in recent years.
Scott Baier, an economist at Clemson University, said those concerns may be founded.
“While such mandates increase demand for domestic producers, they also raise input prices,” he said. “If the bill passes, and increased demand drives up the costs of the construction projects, then citizens may be impacted because the higher construction expenses may reduce the number of infrastructure projects, reduce overall spending flexibility or imply higher taxes in the future.”
American-made steel is the most expensive in the world. However, the price paid for foreign steel has risen to a more even level since the Trump administration increased import taxes, known as tariffs, imposed by the U.S. government on companies that import steel into the country.
The bill also seeks to address the issue by waiving the requirement if a government can’t get U.S.-made steel fast enough or if the use of American steel increases costs by more than 25%.
Those carveouts were enough to calm worries from state agencies, especially the S.C. Department of Transportation, said Rep. Mark Smith, R-Daniel Island.
No one testified against the bill. It advanced to the full House Labor Commerce and Industry Committee.
Yow said the higher costs don’t bother him. He’d rather have peace of mind that the steel going into public roads, bridges and buildings is going to hold up.
“If it costs $5 more a yard or $5 more a ton, it’s worth the life that it saves in the end,” he said.
The U.S. steel industry has been floundering for decades, shuttering mills and laying off workers amid increased global competition.
Vice President Vance touts ‘golden age’ of manufacturing in SC steel visit

That includes the Liberty Steel Mill in Georgetown, which closed for good in 2024 after nearly a decade of on-again-off-again operations.
“I wish that we had had this bill a few years ago and our steel mill would probably still be open,” said Democratic Rep. Carl Anderson, whose district includes the former mill site.
Paxton, along with Devin Webster, a Nucor vice president in the state, blamed cheaply made steel from Turkey, India and China for the industry’s decline.
Nucor employs some 2,500 South Carolinians at multiple locations across Florence, Laurens, Lexington, York and Berkeley counties, as well as in Darlington, Webster said.
While China is the world’s largest steel producer and exporter, it sends very little to the U.S. — less than 2% of total imports into the country, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. President Donald Trump passed a 25% tariff on Chinese steel during his first term, pricing the country out of the market. He’s since upped that to 50%.
Most steel coming into the country comes from Mexico and Canada, followed by Japan, South Korea and Germany. Imports make up about a fifth of all steel used in the U.S.
The steel industry championed the tariffs on foreign steel but is now facing a hurdle as it rushes to build new mills. Demand is not keeping up, the Wall Street Journal reported in August.
Interest rates and the rising cost of steel means less demand for cars and construction that the industry relies on to buy its product.
Baier said policies, such as this legislation, aim to increase that domestic demand. How much of a dent these proposals might make in the industry’s struggles remains to be seen.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/construction-worker-1024x690.jpg,,,2026-01-21 11:00:30.624367

Kelly Ayotte announced Wednesday she will give her annual State of the State address Feb. 5 at 10 a.m. at the State House in Concord.
“Since I was sworn in a year ago, we’ve delivered on key promises to Granite Staters: from fixing the broken bail system, to new laws that will speed up housing construction, to a responsible, balanced budget that protects services for our most vulnerable,” Ayotte wrote in a statement announcing the speech. “I’m proud of what we have done, but there is still work to do to tackle the challenges families across our state are facing.”
In the address, Ayotte — a former state attorney general and U.S. senator who has attempted to position herself as a law-and-order conservative — will likely champion her legislative accomplishments from 2025, when she reversed recent reforms that made it easier for pre-trial criminal suspects to be released on bail; signed legislation to ban so-called sanctuary cities; and signed a bell-to-bell ban on cell phones in public schools. Ayotte also weathered a turbulent budget year in which her Republican colleagues made stringent cuts to her proposed spending plan and the state narrowly averted entering the fiscal year without a budget.
Ayotte is also likely to map out her priorities for the year ahead. She has recently been vocal about her desire to bring the death penalty back to New Hampshire. She will also oversee the implementation of a slate of new laws designed to curb the skyrocketing cost of housing in the state in 2026 and beyond. Lastly, she’s promised to push new laws aimed at making the state’s roads safer.
The governor also faces a number of challenges. Last year, she secured legislative changes that give her administration more control over payouts to victims of a massive abuse scandal in the state’s juvenile justice system; she’ll now have to oversee that. The budget she signed over the summer imposes a set of premiums on certain Medicaid recipients that go into effect this year and have been a frequent target of Democrats. And November’s elections could be challenging for Republicans nationwide under Donald Trump, a president with historically low approval ratings.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ayotteinaugural-1024x711.jpg,,,2026-01-21 11:00:30.624367

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)FREMONT, Neb. — Former State Sen. Lynne Walz of Fremont confirmed Wednesday she will run as a Democratic candidate for Nebraska governor in 2026 after a statewide listening tour.
Walz launched an exploratory committee for governor in November and hinted she would enter the race if her concerns for the state matched those of Nebraskans. She hosted 10 listening sessions in December, from Scottsbluff to Omaha, as well as additional private events with local community leaders.
“Nebraska is full of possibilities, and we need a governor who will focus on creating and attracting good-paying jobs, supporting our public schools and lowering the cost of food, health care and day care,” Walz said Wednesday.
She continued: “I believe we have more in common than what divides us, and I assure you I will be a governor who is focused on Nebraska’s future.”
Also Wednesday, Walz will host a formal launch event in her hometown of Fremont at 10:30 a.m.
Former State Sen. Lynne Walz steps toward run for Nebraska governor

Walz, in a November interview, said her campaign would focus on people. She argued that politicians, no matter their ideology, were “no longer interested in fighting for the average person.”
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, is seeking a second four-year term this year. Earlier this month, Pillen’s campaign announced he had $10 million cash on hand for his reelection bid. Pillen’s campaign had no immediate comment on her Wednesday announcement.
Between 2017 and early 2025, Walz represented conservative-leaning Dodge County in the Nebraska Legislature. Her district expanded to include Valley in 2021. Her legislative colleagues elected her as chair of the Legislature’s Education Committee for 2021 and 2022.
Walz is a Realtor, local church leader and mother of three. She is also a former fourth- and fifth-grade teacher. Before teaching she had been a live-in caregiver for three women with developmental disabilities and worked various jobs to make ends meet, including at 3M and her local Hinky Dinky deli.
“Too many people feel like government isn’t working for them,” Walz said. “I promise to be a governor who listens, tells the truth, and works hard every day to make life better for families across our state.”
Walz will run in the May 12 Democratic primary for governor. The general election is Nov. 3.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Tony Mattivi, director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, described a high school wrestling coach, a paraprofessional, a speech pathologist and a bus driver who all had at least two things in common.
None was required to submit to a criminal history and background check before working in proximity to school-age children, and all were accused or convicted of criminal acts against children they worked near.
“I believe the public would be stunned to know how many people may come in contact with their child in the educational process during a school day who have not been subject to mandatory fingerprint-based criminal history and background checks,” Mattivi said at a Tuesday hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Mattivi urged approval of a bill that would require state and national fingerprint-based criminal history background checks for all employees and volunteers at public and private schools every five years. He characterized the absence of a requirement as a gap in public safety.
The Kansas State Department of Education already requires licensed teachers to undergo fingerprint-based background checks, but the bill would solidify that requirement in state law. Senate Bill 246 also proposes a new fingerprinted background check requirement for other school employees and contractors, such as janitors, cooks, coaches, therapists, paraprofessionals, bus drivers, volunteers and some administrators.
Those positions, Mattivi said, sometimes have greater and more private access to students than teachers do.
Applicants would have to foot the cost of a background check, or a school district could cover it.
Nicole Maddox, information services director at the KBI, said the $57 fee for fingerprint-based background checks covers processing costs for both the KBI and the FBI.
Sen. Mike Argabright, an Olpe Republican, was concerned with turnaround time. Many school boards only meet once a month, especially in rural areas, he said, and the bill as written could create a potential time crunch for the KBI to quickly run checks so schools can onboard the appropriate staff or volunteers.
The KBI currently promises a turnaround for background checks within 7-10 business days. The current average response time, Maddox said, is 9 hours.
The bill’s requirements would apply to approximately 44,000 teachers and 32,000 non-licensed staff each year, according to a fiscal note attached to the bill. If the cost per background check remains at $57, the state education department would receive an additional $4.3 million annually.
The bill is backed by multiple state agencies, and it was introduced last February at the behest of Steven Anderson, the state’s inspector general. It had no opponents.
In a 2023 audit, Anderson recommended almost exactly what the bill proposes, cementing in state law that fingerprint-based criminal background checks be performed in a five year cycle for all school employees.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA010193-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-21 11:00:30.624367

For Lydia, nursing is a career choice—but it’s also a reflection of her true self. Rooted in care and community, her path forward is a continuation of the values that have shaped her from the beginning.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lydia’s close-knit family inspired her to pursue a future in nursing.","The youngest of seven, Lydia Ste. Marie describes her family as loving, full of energy, and busy. She learned early the value of care, connection, and responsibility—lessons that ultimately led her to pursue a degree in nursing.
“I’ve always known I was meant to help people,” she said. Initially, that interest showed up as an interest in teaching. Her mother, Cathi, works as a childcare provider, and two of Lydia’s sisters are teachers. It’s clear Lydia admires them as well as their dedication as educators and caregivers. 
In high school, Lydia worked in the Encore program at Newport City Elementary School, a skill-building program that introduces students to careers, including health care. It’s a job she’s still engaged with. “I love it,” she said. “But then I realized I wanted to go one step further and really explore my curiosity in medicine, and my need to understand how things work.”
Lydia briefly considered medical school, but nursing felt like a better fit. “I really want to care for people, build relationships, and advocate for people,” she said. Nursing offered the balance she was looking for, combining science with hands-on care.
Lydia graduated from North Country Union High School in 2023 and is now a junior at the University of Vermont, where she is majoring in nursing and working toward her Bachelor of Science in Nursing.
“They supported me in every way they could”
As Lydia contemplated how she might achieve these dreams, she knew she would need a college degree. “It’s funny,” Lydia said. “I never felt like I had to go to college. It wasn’t an expectation of my parents, but I also never felt personally like there was another option for me, especially with my dreams.” 
Lydia’s three sisters attended college, and her mom took night classes over a ten-year period to earn her associate degree. And her mom worked incredibly hard to make sure she didn’t accrue debt while she pursued her education. She was always clear with Lydia that attending college was not out of reach. 
Lydia’s support network grew when she connected with VSAC through its GEAR UP college and career readiness program. As a first-generation college student, she was offered some additional assistance with the college application process, which for Lydia, started in her junior year of high school. 
When Lydia decided during her senior year of high school to pursue nursing, her parents’ interest in her future didn’t waver. “They helped me in every way they could. Applications, everything,” Lydia said. Lydia’s dad, Peter Ste. Marie, Sr., recently passed away—which has only furthered her desire to help people. “I want to make him proud,” she shares.
“VSAC found me,” she said. “They supported me in the application process and there were even people who would help us with feedback on our essays,” she said. “Without VSAC, I wouldn’t have known where to start, so I tried to take advantage of all of it.”
Making a data-based decision
Help with her applications and the associated fees enabled Lydia to apply widely. “I applied to every school I could think of with a nursing program,” she said. “The help with the application fees made it possible because it would have been a financial challenge otherwise.”
At first, Lydia imagined going far from home for school. But as she began to focus on finding the right nursing program for her, she began to think a little differently. She researched the pass rates of nursing licensure exams for the graduates of schools she was considering. She also sought schools that had a strong sense of community. And then as decision time approached, she considered the long-term financial impact of her choice. “I stopped and thought about if I really wanted to be paying for school the rest of my life,” she said.
That thought process sealed it for her. Lydia was offered enough financial aid and scholarships to be able to attend the University of Vermont (UVM) debt-free. “My tuition, my room and board, everything is covered,” she said. At UVM, Lydia has found community through UVM First, a program for first-generation students, and the UVM Nurses Association. During her first two years in college, she worked at UVM’s Royall Tyler Theatre through work-study, a job that allowed her to stay connected to another passion, performing arts. 
Starting close to home, open to the world
Looking ahead, Lydia hopes to begin her nursing career close to home. “I’d like to work locally for a few years to get my footing and to feel more confident,” she said. Eventually, she wants to follow her urge to travel far and wide. “The idea of traveling and experiencing the world really appeals to me. It’s possible I’ll choose travel nursing so I can experience living in different cultures and environments.”
Family also continues to play a central role in Lydia’s future. Close with her siblings, mother, and nieces and nephews, she brings values shaped by her family into her education. Additionally, Lydia recently got engaged to her high school sweetheart, Mason, is also from the Newport area. Like her family, Mason is deeply supportive of her dreams and aspirations, whether she stays in Vermont or stretches her wings.
For Lydia, nursing is more than a career choice—it’s a reflection of her true nature. Rooted in care, community, and service, her path forward is a natural continuation of the values that have shaped her from the beginning.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas foster children rarely interact with their court-appointed advocates, and their voices have become muted, a statewide report said.
Chief Judge Amy Harth of the state’s sixth judicial district said the challenges facing Kansas children’s court-appointed advocates are “eerily similar” to the challenges reported 25 years ago. The last time a statewide report evaluating the court-appointed advocate system was conducted was in 2001.
At the root are caseload levels much higher than the national average, inadequate training and paltry compensation, Harth said at a Thursday hearing before the House child welfare committee.
The system is not working, an advisory committee found after an 18-month review of Kansas’ guardian ad litem, or child in need of care, system. In a 2025 report, the committee decided a comprehensive shift is needed to ensure children receive high-quality legal representation.
Kansas has no universal cap on caseloads, and the majority of advocates who responded to a survey from the advisory committee handle volumes above national best practices. Those best practices recommend full-time advocates limit caseloads to 40-60 children and part-time to 20-30 children.
Twelve part-time advocates in Kansas reported handling between 125-305 cases each, the report said.
Excessive caseloads make it nearly impossible for advocates, who are attorneys, to build relationships with children and investigate each case, the report said.
Inadequate compensation for advocates exacerbates caseload issues, especially in Sedgwick and Shawnee counties, the report said.
From 2022-2024, Sedgwick County averaged 585 open cases per year and contracts with eight part-time advocates who took on more than five times the recommended 30-case limit and were paid a $44,400 annual salary, according to the report.
Shawnee County averaged 380 open cases, and to meet the county’s 30-case limit, it would have to contract with 13 part-time advocates. Instead, it contracts with five part-time advocates who are paid $50,400 annually while taking on more than six times the recommended caseload limit.
Kerrie Lonard, the state child advocate, said advocates need to see decreased caseloads and increased competency and performance expectations, “so that we’re not having the same conversation in 2050.”
Each county has the discretion to create its own rules around compensation, training and caseloads for advocates. But the report concluded that the state’s current decentralized system without significant oversight cannot fix caseload, training and competency problems.
Legislators were fiscally skeptical, questioning the practicality of increasing compensation and reducing caseloads simultaneously.
The report put forth options for system-wide change that ranged in levels of local control, including placing oversight in a central state office, creating a regional contracting system or charging local courts with managing contracts and uniform standards.
The solutions sound great, said Democratic Rep. Wanda Brownlee Paige, but the issues are funding and convincing an electorate that has been driven by a push to cut costs to centralize resources.
Budgets reflect what lawmakers care about, said Brownlee Paige, a retired teacher from Kansas City.
“Even though in this society we say we care about children, I don’t see it because the money’s not there,” she said.
Harth, the chief judge, said funding for a central system would largely come from state general fund dollars and county contributions, but Brownlee Paige worried counties like hers — Wyandotte County — wouldn’t be able to bear the weight.
“I mean, I’m dumbfounded,” said Brownlee Paige. “All that sounds good, but is it really real?”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/P1240979-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-21 09:56:40.041069

Brian Seitz, a Republican from Branson pictured speaking on the Missouri House floor in April 2025, is one of four House Republicans sponsoring legislation to remove a sunset on the state's gender-affirming care restrictions. His bill was debated Tuesday evening in the House Emerging Issues Committee, bringing six hours of public testimony (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).A sponsor of legislation to make Missouri’s restrictions on cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers for minors permanent argued Tuesday night that the ban has “no detriments.”
But for six hours, transgender people, their loved ones and physicians told the House Emerging Issues Committee about the hardships they’ve experienced because of the law. Those in opposition to the bill outnumbered those in favor almost four to one.
“I’ve seen the lifelong damage that comes from bills like these,” St. Louis pastor Elijah Anthony told the committee.
“I know that everybody here wants to protect children, but your intent and impact are different,” he said. “These bills do not tell trans kids that you want to protect them.”
The committee also discussed a bill that would remove the expiration date on a law that bars transgender athletes from competing according to their gender identity.
Currently, restrictions on cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers and the transgender athletes law are set to expire Aug. 28, 2027.
“Let adults make adult decisions,” said state Rep. Brian Seitz, a Republican from Branson and one of four sponsors of the legislation. “This is current law and needs to remain law.”
The bills also seek to remove a provision that allows those who received prescriptions for cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers prior to the law’s passage in 2023 to continue their medication.
The state’s ban on gender-affirming surgeries for minors is already permanent.
Months after the law went into effect in 2023, Washington University and University of Missouri Health Care stopped providing cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers to those under 18 — including patients covered by the law’s grandfather clause.
Kelly Storck, a licensed clinical social worker who treats many young people with gender dysphoria, told the committee that losing gender-affirming care in Missouri has created a hardship for her clients.
“I now have clients that have to travel multiple states away, spending thousands of dollars when they used to be able to travel 20 minutes to really high-level, trustworthy, solid, effective, safe care,” she said. “It is an incredible loss.”
Some families, seeking access to gender-affirming care and a supportive environment, have fled the state.
Michael Walk, a volunteer leader with parent organization TransParent, said he knows families that have moved in order to access gender-affirming care for their children.
“People with strong roles in their communities have been uprooted. They no longer live here, work here or pay taxes here,” he said. “But those who remain still need this care.”
Walk was one of the dozens who warned the committee not to pass the restrictions in 2023. The crowd that came to testify that year was different, noted state Rep. Aaron Crossley, a Democrat from Independence.
State Rep. Wick Thomas, D-Kansas City, displays a cup in colors reminiscent of the transgender flag with an encouraging message at the front of their desk during a committee hearing with anti-transgender bills in 2025. Thomas had the same cup Tuesday evening as the committee once again considers removing a sunset on bills placing restrictions on transgender Missourians (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The hearing room “was just filled with kids and families,” he said. This year, there aren’t any.
“I was really moved by the testimony of the children and them sharing how this kind of treatment has helped them, has made them feel more whole,” Crossley said.
Each year since 2023, fewer families have come to the state Capitol to oppose anti-transgender legislation. Some have moved out of state or have felt unsafe publicly identifying as transgender. Others feel beaten down.
Kyle Freels, a father from St. Louis, tossed his hands up as he sat at the witness desk.
“Coming here is a waste of your time and ours,” he said. “These bills will pass with or without our testimony.”
His wife, Rene Freels, said she anticipates that the General Assembly will pass the bill. But she still insists on sitting face-to-face with lawmakers and sharing her concerns.
“Us parents, we love our kids, and we love our family. And everyone is our family,” she said. “And we are not going to stop fighting until they have full, equal rights.”
Transgender athletes
Debate on a bill that would ban transgender athletes from competing according to their gender also brought hours of testimony, largely in opposition.
Three bill sponsors told the committee their aim was to “protect” women’s athletics.
Allowing transgender girls to compete in women’s sports causes “women and girls to suffer and become less than rather than equal,” Seitz said. “Years of training, practice and hope are extinguished.”
State Rep. Hardy Billington, a Republican from Poplar Bluff, and state Rep. Bennie Cook, a Republican from Houston, filed identical bills to Seitz.
Of the three bill sponsors, only Billington said he watched women’s sports. But he could only name one female athlete.
But it’s not about being a sports fan, Billington said. He filed the bill out of concern for “men harming women.”
Seitz told the committee it was a matter of “fairness” and an extension of women’s fight for equality.
“​​I am old enough to remember the (establishment of) Title IX, when women finally broke through the glass ceiling and they could compete,” he said.
State Rep. Wick Thomas, a Kansas City Democrat and the state’s first nonbinary lawmaker, said the bill does not support women or advance equality.
“This bill doesn’t do that,” they said. “This bill just takes away from people.”
A group of softball players from Lincoln University disagreed. One of those players, Reese Smith, testified that the idea of playing against a “six-foot, two-hundred-something” person scared her.
“I don’t see why it would be fair for biological men to play a female sport when we already had to fight hard enough,” she said.
State Rep. Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, told Smith that the bill was about athletes competing according to their gender identity.
“No one is suggesting that we put a full grown man on a field with you,” she said. “To be very clear, that is not what this is about.”
Sage Coram, representing the ACLU of Missouri, warned the committee that the restrictions on transgender athletes could be subject to heightened scrutiny in court and therefore vulnerable to being struck down.
“Trans youth like all youth simply want to participate in the activities that they love, including athletics,” she said. “The statute is ineffective in its aims and discriminatory towards children and families across the state.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska lawmakers opened the second year of their regular legislative session on Tuesday with an ambitious agenda but low expectations amid a tight budget that appears likely to draw the lion’s share of legislators’ attention.
“It’s one big log jam,” said Sen. Bert Stedman, R-Sitka. 
The Alaska Legislature operates on a two-year cycle between elections; bills are carried over from the first year to the second, but if they don’t pass the Legislature by the end of the second year, they expire and must start all over again. 
Speaking Tuesday, members of the coalitions in charge of the House and Senate said they hope to address pensions for public employees, the proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline, a long-term plan to balance state expenses and revenue, elections legislation and a handful of other major topics — all while dealing with an annual state budget that’s tightly constrained by the price of oil and a reluctance to enact legislation that will raise revenue.
On top of that, there are two newly appointed members of the state House, two members of the House who switched to the Senate, and new leaders in both the House and Senate’s minority caucuses.
The regular session is scheduled to end May 20. 

Topic No. 1 is the state’s annual budgetary balancing act
“I think the big topic always is the budget,” said Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham.
In December, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy proposed a $7.75 billion state budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1 plus additional spending in the current fiscal year.
Alaska lacks the revenue to pay for that spending, so the governor has proposed spending $1.8 billion from savings.
Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel and co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee, noted that the governor’s budget proposal calls for a large Permanent Fund dividend.
Reduce the governor’s proposal to $1,000 per recipient, and the deficit disappears — but only if you don’t include additional expenses that the governor left out of his budget, Hoffman said.
The Legislature could use savings to balance the budget, but members of the Senate majority believe the state’s Constitutional Budget Reserve — the state’s primary savings account — shouldn’t be used for recurring expenses.
“I’ve said it a couple of times, we shouldn’t be spending those dollars on one-time items,” Hoffman said.
If that position holds, the governor’s budget will need to undergo major changes before becoming final.
It takes 45 votes — 30 in the House and 15 in the Senate — in the 60-person Legislature to spend from the Constitutional Budget Reserve. 
Getting those votes has historically been a challenge because it will require members of the majority caucuses to compromise with members of the minority caucuses.
In prior years, the Legislature has deadlocked over the issue, driving the state to the brink of a government shutdown.
“The budget is in an environment that’s fiscally constrained, and it’s going to be challenged by additional expenses that we’re going to see in the supplemental measure. That’s our top priority,” Edgmon said.
Governor’s veto of transportation projects looms large
One of the “additional expenses” that has legislators worried the most is funding for the state’s annual transportation construction budget.
Last year, Dunleavy vetoed a chunk of that budget because lawmakers intended to pay for it by diverting money from previously funded projects. Legislators did not take up a veto override during their August special session.
That’s left a hole of about $70 million needed to unlock ten times that amount of federal money.
Filling the hole will likely require spending from the Constitutional Budget Reserve, which needs a supermajority in the House and Senate.
“There are businesses that are going to close if the next construction year is not funded, and so I’m pretty concerned about it,” said Sen. Cathy Giessel, R-Anchorage.
Stedman called it a “significant issue.”
“We do have a deficit in this current fiscal year, and it is very difficult to deal with the three-quarter vote. … So we’ll wait and see what the governor’s proposal is to fix the mess he created,” Stedman said.
More than 20 groups representing a variety of organizations across the state have been urging lawmakers to act on the issue, going so far as to launch a statewide ad campaign that asks Alaskans to also join the lobbying effort.
Without quick action, the groups say, there will not be enough time to put money to work during the summer construction season.

Governor expected to reveal fiscal plan during State of the State
Shortly after opening their session on Tuesday, lawmakers formally invited Dunleavy to deliver his annual State of the State address at 7 p.m. Thursday.
That’s unusually early, but Dunleavy is expected to use the speech — his final State of the State before leaving office in December — to unveil a comprehensive plan to bring state expenses and revenue into alignment over the long term.
That’s likely to require significant new taxes or major budget cuts: A 10-year plan published by the governor’s office in December showed that the state will need to raise as much as $1.6 billion in additional money per year to keep state services at current levels in 2035. 
Since oil prices plunged in 2015, state legislators and governors have been unable to fully resolve a fiscal gap that has bedeviled the state.
“It’s something that’s been on the docket for a long time, but it comes with a certain level of controversy, angst and maybe outright resistance,” Edgmon said.
Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, said lawmakers initially expected the governor to propose a handful of bills, “but now there’s going to be an omnibus bill that has all of the issues in it,” he said.
House and Senate leaders were briefed on the outline of the governor’s plan earlier this week without receiving details.
Stevens, Edgmon and other legislators reserved comment on the governor’s ideas until they see the full text. 
“It’s impossible to opine on it at this point without seeing the bills, without seeing what he’s truly putting forward,” Edgmon said.

Veto override vote possible on Thursday
Hours before the governor talks about a comprehensive fiscal plan, legislators will vote on an incremental bill that would provide funding for education programs across the state.
The House and Senate passed Senate Bill 113 last year but Dunleavy vetoed it. If lawmakers override the governor, online companies would be required to pay corporate income taxes in Alaska for services delivered in Alaska. 
Current law allows them to pay those taxes at the site of their server farms or other physical offices.
“I think Senate Bill 113, quite frankly, is a litmus test for where we’re going to go with the fiscal plan,” Edgmon said.
Pension bill awaits attention in the Senate
On Friday, the Senate Labor and Commerce Committee will begin hearing a bill that would re-establish a pension plan for state employees and teachers.
The House passed the bill last year, leaving the issue in the hands of the Senate, which passed a similar bill in 2024. While Dunleavy has previously voiced opposition to the idea of a pension revival, a narrow majority of legislators appear favorable to the idea, saying it is important for Alaska to offer competitive benefits when hiring prospective workers.

New legislators and legislators take their seats
Last year, Sens. Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, and Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, resigned from the Legislature to cover statewide office. Dunleavy appointed Reps. George Rauscher, R-Sutton, and Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, to fill those Senate seats. 
Rauscher and Tilton sat as senators for the first time on Tuesday, while their replacements sat as representatives for the first time in the House — longtime legislative aide Steve St. Clair and Sutton Community Council member Garret Nelson.
Both are stalwart Republicans and aren’t expected to significantly change the mix in the state House, where they will sit in the 19-member, all-Republican House Minority caucus.
The House is controlled by a 21-person coalition of Democrats, independents and two Republicans. 
The House’s Republican minority has a new leader this year — Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, who replaced Rep. Mia Costello, R-Anchorage, during the legislative interim. Johnson gave up her position on the powerful House Finance Committee — a hurdle for any bill with a price tag — in order to take her role as the face of the minority.
Replacing Johnson on the finance committee is Rep. Elexie Moore, R-Wasilla. 
Some members of the House minority were unhappy with Johnson’s election as leader in part because that vote took place before St. Clair and Nelson were appointed. Since then, Johnson has been confirmed with a second vote, and any division among members of the House has quieted.
In the Senate, Shower’s departure required the selection of a new leader for the six-person, all-Republican minority caucus there. Sen. Mike Cronk, R-Tok, was elected to that role by his fellow minority Republicans.
The Senate continues to be led by a 14-person coalition that includes nine Democrats and five Republicans.

Legislators prepare to take up natural gas pipeline issues
The proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline will be the top priority of the Senate Resources Committee, Giessel said on Tuesday. 
Developers of that project have said they intend to make a go/no-go decision on the pipeline’s first phase early this year, and Dunleavy has floated the idea of a large state property tax break in order to encourage the project.
On Tuesday, members of the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee voted to spend up to $250,000 to hire Pegasus Global to advise the Legislature on the pipeline project. The Legislature already has an advisory firm, GaffneyCline, on contract, but that firm’s parent company, Baker Hughes, plans to get involved with the pipeline project.

(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)Retired sportscaster Michele Tafoya on Wednesday announced she will run for Minnesota’s soon-to-be vacated U.S. Senate seat as a Republican.
Tafoya, who has teased a run for weeks, is seeking the seat held by Sen. Tina Smith, who is retiring at the end of the year.
Tafoya was a sports broadcaster for over 30 years, most notably with NBC Sunday Night Football, and retired in 2022. After leaving television, Tafoya became the co-chair for Kendall Qualls’ unsuccessful 2022 Republican campaign for governor. She now has a Minnesota politics podcast.
“For too long, hardworking people have been ripped off by criminals, corporations and career politicians, and the people doing everything right are the ones paying the biggest price,” Tafoya said in a video posted to X announcing her campaign. “Well, I’m not going to stay on the sidelines any longer.”
Tafoya joins a large group of GOP candidates running for the Republican nomination, including former Minnesota Republican Party Chair David Hann, 2024 GOP nominee for U.S. Senate and conspiracy theorist Royce White and Navy Seal Adam Schwarze. Precinct caucuses are Feb. 3, meaning Tafoya has days to round up the caucus-goers who will eventually endorse candidates at the Republican state convention in May.
Tafoya’s name recognition will likely help her in a primary contest, as well as her status as a political outsider. But she’s a self-described “pro-choice conservative,” which may hurt her prospects among Republicans — especially the partisans who typically gather at the state convention and conservative voters who tend to turn out for the August primary.
Tafoya is a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump and frequent critic of Minnesota Democrats. Most recently, she’s criticized Gov. Tim Walz for the fraud in public programs that has occurred under his watch.

(Photo: Amazon press center)Nevada has changed how it calculates its list of the top employers of Medicaid recipients. But Amazon is still solidly at the top of the list.
Fellow retail giant Walmart and Clark County School District also remain the second and third top employer of Nevada Medicaid recipients, respectively.
Meanwhile, gaming companies saw steep drops in the ranking.
Rounding out the top five in this year’s report are the State of Nevada and Tesla. The State of Nevada was fifth last year. Tesla was 11th.
The 2026 report, which came out earlier this month and covers the state’s most recent fiscal year, uses a new methodology in an attempt to filter out Nevada Medicaid recipients who did not work at least 30 hours per week, meaning they were not full-time employees.
The changes, which the state acknowledged were made following feedback from “stakeholders,” contributed heavily to a 27.6% drop in the number of people captured by the report.
Not surprisingly, fewer people being captured in the report correlated with a lower overall cost to the state and federal government, which split the cost of coverage. The report noted a 15.4% reduction in Nevada Medicaid costs captured in the report compared to last year. 
However, the average cost per member per year increased by 16.9%.
Among employers with more than 50 total employees: 133,934 full-time workers and their 141,545 dependents were covered by Nevada Medicaid in State Fiscal Year 2025.
That’s approximately 275,000 people total. It cost $949 million to provide coverage, with the state picking up 22.5% and the federal government picking up 77.5%.
Using the previous methodology, the report covering the prior fiscal year calculated the number of full-time employees and dependents at approximately 380,000. The cost was $1.1 billion.
For Amazon, this year’s reporting changes contributed to a 44% decrease in the number of employees and dependents listed as covered by Nevada Medicaid. The report notes that is “a sharper decline than observed in the broader labor market.”
Walmart’s Medicaid recipient count dropped 24%.
Tesla’s dropped 13%.
The two public employers near the top of the list — the State of Nevada and CCSD — both saw their Medicaid recipient counts drop 20%.
It appears the biggest beneficiary of the changes to the reporting criteria are employers within the state’s flagship industry.
Gaming establishments saw noticeable drops in rank, the report highlighted. Wynn Las Vegas fell from fourth to ninth on the list. Aria fell from 10th to 21st. 
Wynn and Aria’s Medicaid recipient counts dropped by 46% and 48%, respectively. 
Venetian ranked 12th in both the 2026 and 2025 reports, but the company’s Medicaid recipient count dropped by 32%.
Meanwhile, Resorts World, MGM Grand, and Mandalay Bay Corp fell out of the top 30 entirely. Those companies were 15th, 17th and 20th last year.
“These shifts may reflect new labor agreements on the Las Vegas Strip,” reads the report, “but many casino employees are still near the minimum thresholds for this report, suggesting that work hours may be strategically managed to limit benefits eligibility.”
The annual report now captures the number of people who earned $4,320 or more in pre-tax wage earnings for any 12-week period of the last fiscal year. That’s equivalent to working at least 30 hours at minimum wage ($12 per hour).
Since the last report was released, the state began collecting from Medicaid recipients info on the number of hours they worked and their salary. That data was used when available, but notably was not available for 63% of Medicaid recipients.
The state expects the new work hour data to be available and used in future reports.
A 30-hour threshold was chosen because it aligns with existing federal employer healthcare mandates and work requirements mandated by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which are set to go into effect at the start of 2027.
Those new work requirements “will cause the number of employees and their dependents counted in this report to decline considerably going forward,” according to the report.

Can artificial intelligence replicate one of the most complex human art forms — dancing — and is it a threat to dancers and their profession?
CalMatters reporters set out to answer those questions by first testing four commercially-available AI video-generation models: OpenAI’s Sora, Google’s Veo, MiniMax’s Hailou and Kuaishou’s Kling. The models were prompted to depict humans performing nine different dances, including bird dancing as practiced by the Cahuilla Band of Indians, folklórico and the Mashed Potato from the 1960s.
All 36 videos failed to generate a video of a person performing the specific dance requested — though one returned a video of a human dancing. 
Though these results, which reporters ran late last year, were underwhelming, they showed a marked improvement and generated fewer visual inconsistencies from results that were initially tested in 2024.
AI’s ability to quickly improve its photorealistic content and its implications with the dance industry underscore how the technology affects other creative fields and artists. In 2023, Hollywood writers and actors went on strike in part to address the usage of AI replicating their work. Video game motion actors and voice actors last year also walked off the job to seek protections from AI. 
While dancers don’t have to worry too much for now about AI replacing them, some dancers CalMatters spoke with expressed concern about how their performance videos posted online are helping AI models train themselves, without dancers’ permission.

Emma Andre, a dance teacher and choreographer in Berkeley: “My body and my dancing is mine, and the idea that that can just be siphoned through this process and then become part of AI without my consent is something that I don’t love the idea of.”

CA makes progress against fraud

As the Trump administration continues to threaten California over allegations of fraud in social welfare programs, Gov. Gavin Newsom is touting that the state has reduced theft of food and cash benefits, writes CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.
The governor said last week that thefts totaled more than $4 million a month last fall for the CalFresh food assistance and CalWorks cash welfare benefits program. That’s down $16 million from two years ago, when $20 million a month were reported stolen from public benefits recipients in California.
The thefts Newsom cited involved fraudsters using hidden devices to steal EBT card numbers. The cards are then duplicated and then drained of cash or used to make large purchases before card owners are made aware. When money is stolen from these cards, the state uses taxpayer dollars to reimburse the victims.
Critics of Newsom’s statement said the number of threats reported by the state is likely an undercount.

Point-in-time counts start this week


Volunteers survey a resident experiencing homelessness for the annual point-in-time count in San Diego on Jan. 25, 2024. Photo by Adriana Heldiz, CalMatters




From CalMatters homelessness reporter Marisa Kendall:
California counties are starting their homeless point-in-time counts this week, which means volunteers will set out before dawn in an attempt to answer a crucial question: Is the state’s homelessness crisis improving, or getting worse?
The count is an effort to tally every person sleeping outside or in a shelter bed on a single night. Though it’s imperfect — volunteers are likely to miss people, different counties use different methodology and some numbers are estimates — the results affect counties’ homelessness funding, policies and politics. 
Alameda, Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties are among those conducting their counts this week, and Fresno County is counting next week. Not all California counties are doing it this year. The feds require each county to count every other year, so some won’t count again until 2027. 
Typically, the federal government gathers that data and releases statewide and national totals in December. We’re still waiting on that report for 2025, but Gov. Newsom recently said California saw a 9% decrease last year in the number of people sleeping on sidewalks and in other places not meant for habitation.

,California,2026-01-21 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Would California voters actually support a wealth tax on billionaires?,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/california-voters-wealth-tax-billionaires/,Should taxing real estate be supplemented by tapping other assets of the state’s billionaires? California voters may decide this year if a wealth tax initiative qualifies for the ballot.,"In a sense, California has been taxing wealth since it became a state 175 years ago. 
Well into the 20th century, the state relied on taxing land and buildings which, in that agrarian period, were major forms of personal wealth. The state eventually imposed other taxes and by the 1930s, property taxes exclusively financed local services. 
Today, despite the limit on property taxes imposed by 1978’s Proposition 13, levies on nearly $9 trillion in taxable real estate, generate about $98 billion in revenue each year. The money gets roughly split between school districts and local governments.
Despite those massive numbers, real estate no longer dominates Californians’ personal wealth, which now tops $30 trillion. About a third is residential real estate, with commercial real estate, investments, personal property and cash representing the rest.
It’s believed that California has about 200 billionaires who collectively have about $2 trillion in net assets, or approximately 7% of Californians’ wealth — overwhelmingly business investments, particularly in technology.
So, should taxing real estate be supplemented by tapping other assets of the state’s billionaires? Voters may decide this year because a wealth tax initiative is being circulated by a union representing health care workers. It would impose a one-time 5% tax, mostly on their investments, that would raise an estimated $100 billion.
It’s needed, Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West contends, to shore up vital health care services threatened by reductions in federal subventions and the state budget’s own deficits.
The proposal carries multiple philosophical, economic and political aspects.
Taxing wealth can be dated back to ancient Egypt. Since California already taxes real estate, why should other forms of personal wealth be exempted?
Moreover, California already taxes incomes on a sliding scale with the highest rates on those with the highest incomes, so shouldn’t a wealth tax be imposed using the same rationale?
Most of the 200 or so Californians who would be taxed would probably answer “no” to those questions. A few have already fled for states such as Nevada, Texas and Florida that don’t tax incomes.
In theory, those who haven’t already migrated would still be subject to the wealth tax because it would be backdated to Jan. 1, 2026. However, the tax would likely face legal challenges, and targeted taxpayers who haven’t already moved likely would argue that retroactive levies are illegal.
The sponsoring union could face opposition from unions representing other professions because they would see little or no benefit. Having it on the ballot could affect another measure, sponsored by public employee unions, that would continue a surtax on high-income earners that was first adopted in 2012 and later extended to 2030. It raises about $10 billion a year.
Meanwhile, Gov. Gavin Newsom is loudly opposed, contending that a wealth tax would drive wealthy people out of the state. The top 1% of wealthy Californians pay nearly half of the state’s income taxes.
Newsom last week called the measure “badly drafted,” arguing that its revenue wouldn’t be spread among other groups. 
“It does not support our public educators,” he said. “Does not support our teachers and counselors, our librarians. It doesn’t support our first responders and firefighters. Doesn’t support the general fund and parks.”
While Newsom has long opposed wealth tax proposals, his obvious presidential ambitions surely play a role in his promises to lead an opposition campaign. The passage of a wealth tax could be weaponized in a presidential campaign.
Would California voters embrace a wealth tax on the ballot?
A poll commissioned by opponents and released Tuesday found that the measure obtained a bare plurality when a sample of voters was read its official wording, but declined when they heard a counterargument.

Dancers say their craft can’t be duplicated by AI. Our tests show they’re right — for now.


Bird singing and dancing, as practiced by the Cahuilla Band of Indians, tell a story about the creation of the world, and how the Cahuilla migrated to their current home in Southern California. Moving the same way your ancestors did, perhaps on the exact same land, makes you feel part of the past, present, and future all at once, said tribal member Emily Clarke. She’s done bird dance with her loved ones since she was 7 years old—an act, she said, not only of spirituality but also of perseverance, since bird dance is among the acts of Native American culture nearly eradicated by colonization and U.S. government policy.
So when Clarke heard that some generative artificial intelligence models, like Google’s Veo 3 and OpenAI’s Sora 2, can mimic the dance, her first thought was that it was wrong, distasteful and disrespectful. Then she wondered briefly if automated forms of bird dance could help preserve her culture—before deciding they can’t, since they will never replicate the conversations and community bonds that have helped give Cahuilla bird dance its distinct style and impassioned practitioners.
“It would miss the cultural and social importance, and without that, it’s not bird dancing,” she said.
Developers of AI systems are working continuously to do a better and better job of replicating complex human movement, including dance. Doing so has become a sort of Holy Grail in the field of generative AI due to the many technical challenges involved, but it remains an open question among dancers like Clarke of how much the technology will disrupt the world of dance as it progresses.
Clarke’s conflicting and uncertain thoughts about AI mirror those of other dancers across California interviewed by CalMatters, who were, depending on the specific question or moment in time, optimistic, skeptical and concerned about AI’s incursion into their art form. Most settled into the view that AI is incapable of capturing the uniquely human aspects of dancing, including the cultures surrounding it, the pride and passion of dancers, the energy imparted by audiences, or the form’s essential element of improvisation.

CalMatters and The Markup tested four commercially-available AI video-generation models — OpenAI’s Sora, Google’s Veo, MiniMax’s Hailou, and Kuaishou’s Kling — and so far, dancers don’t have much to worry about. Late last year, we asked the four models to depict humans performing nine different dances, from the Apple dance popularized on TikTok to bird dance, folklorico and the Mashed Potato. All but one of our 36 tests returned a video of a human dancing, but all the videos failed to produce a video of a person performing the specific dance requested. Furthermore, a little under a third of the videos included many of the common issues seen in generative video, like inconsistencies in a subject’s appearance from frame to frame, abnormalities in movement, or too many limbs.
Video generation models still make obvious mistakes like liquefying limbs or sudden changes in clothing, but they are clearly improving. When we ran similar tests in late 2024, videos had more impossible limb movements and visual inconsistencies, failings that appear less frequently and are more difficult to spot today.
(You can read how we tested and evaluated AI-generated dance videos in a separate article here.)

Clarke said of the AI-generated videos depicting Cahuilla Band of Indians bird dance: “None of these depictions are anywhere close to bird dancing, in my opinion. The regalia is only similar in that there are skirts with ribbons, but the songs and dance movements are completely off.”
Generative AI, technology that makes it possible to quickly generate audio, text, imagery or video with a simple text prompt, raises issues beyond the dance community. It’s often made with data scraped from the internet, meaning that creatives who share their work online risk having it used to train AI models. 
Understanding how AI might affect the world of dance has also taken on new urgency as AI begins to influence the art and careers of creatives in adjacent fields and slop begins to crowd out images of real people on social media.
A nearly five-month strike in 2023 by Hollywood writers was prompted in part by concerns around the use of artificial intelligence in entertainment. An actors strike also addressed the effects of AI on performers’ work.  Lawmakers are trying to sort out the policy implications; the California Legislature last year passed laws sponsored by the Screen Actors Guild to protect actors from getting turned into digital replicas without their consent. Next year, lawmakers will consider passage of a bill supported by Hollywood creatives which places digital fingerprints on copyright material so individuals can ask tech companies if their work was used to train their generative AI models and give them grounds to demand compensation or credit.
Most dancers are not unionized, although some are part of SAG-AFTRA, along with others who earn a living by moving their bodies, like stunt performers and martial artists. Within this group, video game motion actors are at the vanguard; they went on strike last year alongside voice actors as they sought protections from AI.
Hip hop, folklorico, and the limits of tech
Edye Kelly, 23, first started dancing in a Bay Area hip-hop studio in 2016. She moved down to the Los Angeles area a couple of years ago to pursue a career in dance. She has been in a Daddy Yankee music video, and has performed at the Grammys as one of the dancers for R&B singer-songwriter Sza. She completed her first tour as a backup dancer with multi-platinum pop entertainer Usher. 
Kelly heard creatives talk about how AI could affect their work during the SAG-AFTRA actors’ strike, but she doesn’t think many dancers know about the possibility that the technology could have a big impact on their livelihoods.
She said full-body motion technology is already beginning to encroach on human dancers’ territory: “It kind of already has happened, when you think of video games and how they use dancers for ‘Just Dance’ or ‘Michael Jackson: The Experience.’ ” Those video games use a combination of real dancers’ movements and motion technology, according to dancers who have talked online about their work for the games. Ubisoft, the maker of both games, on its website touts its use of AI “across the board” to “create believable worlds” and has posted to YouTube a video showing its capture process in action. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on its use of software to simulate or augment dance.
Kelly, who earns money by dancing and teaching dance classes, is concerned that AI could eventually threaten dancers’ jobs and said she hopes dancers are fairly compensated if their likenesses or moves are used to train AI models.  
But she struck an optimistic note, too, saying,  “I don’t think AI could ever get to a point of perfectly mimicking humans … We are constantly evolving. They would always be behind in some kind of way.”
Nadia Arambula is an introvert, but that all melts away when she’s dancing.Arambula, 46, started folklorico dancing as a toddler in Guadalajara. Folklorico dance styles and clothing vary by state or region in Mexico, and as a child Arambula embraced the fashions of the Jalisco region by playing dress up in her mom’s colorful skirt and heels. When she was 5, her mom signed her up for dance classes at her daycare, and she’s been at it ever since. Today Arambula dances at events in San Diego at places such as Padres baseball games and community gatherings with her students at Ballet Folklórico El Tapatío.
Jalisco folklorico videos generated using, clockwise from top-left, OpenAI’s Sora 2, Google’s Veo 3.1, Kuaishou’s Kling 2.5 and MiniMax’s Hailou 2.3.
Arambuila said she has danced nearly her entire life because she enjoys how the elegant, flowing drawing movements with skirts projects pride in Mexican culture and manifests joy and a sense of freedom. She also loves teaching insecure young people to get up on a stage and live out loud—to feel the sort of joy she feels when she dances.
Arambula believes it’s impossible for AI to mimic the emotion of a dancer, especially when it comes to interacting with the audience. The tech, she said, will never be able to transmit the grace, joy and emotions she feels when she dances.
“When I perform, I can feel the audience,” she said. “I give life to the people, and at the same time receive life from the people. It’s beautiful. There are no words that describe the feeling that I have when I perform and seeing the audience wants to be part of this moment.”
Shown some of Jalisco folklorico AI dance videos generated by CalMatters and The Markup, Arambula said they don’t come close to representing the Jalisco dance style she grew up with and teaches today. There’s no proper footwork, posture or skirt movement — all essential elements of the style. In some instances, AI makes a head turn without shoulders following or make part of a dress disappear for a moment, but she said she has to stop to catch the imperfections. She may not notice them if she scrolled past these videos in her social media feed without an indication they were made by AI.
Dance competition
Computer scientists have for years made it a grand challenge that their AI models could generate convincing dance videos on demand from textual descriptions — not unlike similar dreams of developing AI that can drive a car next to humans on city streets or one that can detect emergencies before any humans dial 9-1-1. Videos from YouTube and TikTok provided them with ample training data, helping AI systems generate movement without needing sensor-laden humans to literally dance for them, a process known as “motion capture” that is currently required for most video games and augmented reality worlds. (YouTube now prohibits the use of videos it hosts for training models unless users opt in. TikTok did not respond  to repeated requests for comment.)
Researchers at UC Berkeley made important strides in 2018, when they used YouTube videos to train AI to do acrobatics like backflips, martial arts, and, perhaps most importantly, the Gangnam Style dance. Subsequent work by Berkeley researchers in 2019 used video of a ballerina on YouTube as training data. In 2022, a UCLA researcher, along with their collaborators, introduced Bailando, a generative dance AI model. The same year, Stanford researchers introduced EDGE, which can generate lengthy state-of-the-art breakdancing video based on only five seconds of  music and video. In 2024, researchers from the University of Southern California and TikTok parent company Bytedance introduced AI models that imitate facial expressions and dance moves.
Making videos with AI has become even easier with the advent of generative AI models from companies like OpenAI, Midjourney and Runway. 
Despite this progress, AI models still struggle to create natural movement. For example, it’s easy to make a video of a fireplace ablaze or a Hollywood explosion, said UC Berkeley computer science professor James O’Brien, but it’s hard to make a video of a wildfire impacted by strong winds. This limitation means AI models may do a poor job at imitating some dance moves today, but O’Brien said it’s important to appreciate that when AI developers fix their sights on a challenge, they can make vast improvement within a matter of months. Two years ago, for example, text-to-video models were incapable of producing videos of Will Smith eating spaghetti (which, like dance, is another defacto benchmark for AI models). Today such videos are not perfect, but they’re much more lifelike than they used to be.
Computer scientists are interested in being able to generate realistic videos of dance because the capability is a gateway to creating a range of photorealistic human movement, said Yuanhao Zhai, a recent Ph.D. graduate in computer vision from State University of New York at Buffalo. If you can generate video of a gymnast doing a backflip, for example, it will be easier to produce footage of a person walking down the block.
Feeling dance moves under your skin
A ballerina figurine atop a music box is what inspired Emma Andre, 26, to dance. She was 3 years old and mesmerized by the miniature as it spun around a tiny piano, bent in an arabesque. She told her parents she wanted to go to dance class. A creative movement class led to lessons in ballet and contemporary dance, attendance at the Boston Conservatory, and training with dance companies in New York City. Today Andre choreographs dance performances and teaches dance to kids in Berkeley in the same kind of classes where she got her start.
Lately, she’s enjoyed movement in dance shows like My Obsession with Hamletmachine and the Yerba Buena Garden ChoreoFest in San Francisco. She also enjoys working with her partner and fellow dancer Henry Winslow on a duet that she calls their dance theater idea farm. Last year they performed a three-part duet in front of an 11-person audience in their one-room apartment in Oakland, a feat that required some modifications to ensure Winslow didn’t stick a leg out a window or upset downstairs neighbors.

Andre said she’s open to exploring the use of AI in dance, but believes that it is a uniquely human form of movement, incorporating elements that cannot be imitated by AI. Even if AI got every step right, it cannot capture the lessons and experiences that sometimes determine the next step for human dancers. A pirouette, a spin on one leg, is different every single time, she said. 
“I do a lot of improvisation for my choreography, so I don’t even know what I’m gonna make. And so it’s really crazy to me that an AI could predict that?” she asked. “We talk a lot about fascia, which is the layer of connective tissue under your skin that goes throughout your entire body. And I feel like a lot of my movement stems from a fascia level. You can’t map that externally.”
What drives her to continue to dance is the joy of movement and connection, of meeting people and building relationships through dance. Ephemeral, beautiful, intimate moments of movement make dance what it is, she said.  She’s also motivated to pass on that passion to young people — seeing them discover and feel creative and confident the same way she learned when she was a child  fuels her interest in exploration.
“I have a choice, but I will always choose to dance,” she said.
Andre said she found a depiction of the Horton modern dance style generated using the Veo 3 model “staggeringly lifelike,” but she caught moments in a majority of the generated videos where something is“not quite right,” like when a dancer’s head is momentarily on backwards in one video, or when a ballet dancer bounces on to their tippy toes, but they’re wearing soft shoes, and you would only do that in hard toe ballet slippers.
Horton-style dance videos generated using, clockwise from top-left, OpenAI’s Sora 2, Google’s Veo 3.1, Kuaishou’s Kling 2.5 and MiniMax’s Hailou 2.3.
“It’s really confusing to me why anyone would prefer this instead of hiring one of the thousands of really capable, really talented dancers in most major U.S. cities,” she said. “The whole point of dance is connecting with the human form.”
Winslow enjoys how dance connects him with Andre and other people in order to create something meaningful together, and delights in feeling the history of movement styles developed over generations that traveled across continents.
Sometimes a dance step is new and sometimes it’s something in the zeitgeist or you didn’t know you picked up from theater camp as a teenager. The majority of the time it isn’t new but something you learned over time, something programmed into a dancer’s nervous system over the span of days or decades, or mirror neurons that fire in the brains of experienced dancers when they watch other dancers perform. He questions how AI can imitate those human processes.
“Because we’ve been doing this for a while, there’s just a lot under the surface,” he said.
Social media: To share or not to share
Andre said she stopped sharing her dance on Instagram in order to take a mental health break from the unhealthy dopamine dependency such platforms can enable. Posting dance videos on Instagram has helped Andre find jobs, but she said that if generative AI started imitating her favorite dance styles she would be less likely to post videos online in the future because she doesn’t like the idea that her body and movements can be copied and used by an AI model.
And she’s worried about constricting her posting that way because she believes dance is meant to be shared. If fewer dancers share their videos it can reduce learning and access. She has a contemporary dance degree from Boston Conservatory but learned how to do fouetté turns from a YouTube video and has drawn inspiration for how to choreograph dance performances from other videos posted on social media.
“My body and my dancing is mine, and the idea that that can just be siphoned through this process and then become part of AI without my consent is something that I don’t love the idea of,” she said. 
Conversely, Arambula said she’s fine with the makers of AI scraping video of her performances because she’s confident that a machine cannot imitate the way she connects with an audience.
Emily Clarke said that if she found out her videos were part of data used to train video-generating AI, she too would stop publicly posting videos on social media, but she’s not worried about that negatively impacting community connection since it’s more common to learn bird dancing from an elder or another tribe member than it is to learn on social media.
Zion Harris is 25 years old and has been dancing since he was 5. He was 12 when he made it onto the Golden State Warriors’ Junior Jam dance team as a part-time employee of the NBA franchise, which is when he said he seriously began to think of making a living as a dancer.

Now he’s doing it. Harris, who grew up in the Bay Area, has been on tour as a backup dancer with Puerto Rican rappers Bad Bunny and Daddy Yankee, getting to explore North and South America in the process. He has performed at the Grammys with country/hip-hop crossover star Lil Nas X. He’s been in a Coach commercial with Houston rapper Megan Thee Stallion.
Dance has helped him get through his “hardest times,” Harris said. “It blows my mind every day that I can do this.” His main sources of income are tours, music videos and stage performances. When there are human dancers at a concert, “it definitely helps with the crowd… and brings the artist’s vision alive,” he said. “Having a hologram, or digital images on a screen, would be boring.”
There are times when things get slow for Harris. But when he’s not on a job, he is training — taking dance classes or holding practice sessions with his fellow dancers. 
Harris is signed with a casting agency that helps him book jobs, but social media plays a huge role in getting him noticed and sometimes helps him find opportunities directly. So the possibility of his moves and likeness being copied off social media platforms by AI is “definitely a big worry,” he said.
“Everything is becoming easy to replicate or use without consent,” Harris said. “But if we don’t post [on social media], our opportunities could stop. You really just have to take the gamble.”
Dancers and educators experimenting with AI
Though some dancers are clearly concerned about having their work exploited to build artificial intelligence models, others are experimenting with incorporating AI into their craft. Performers associated with the dance tech nonprofit Kinetech have used AI in a number of ways since the organization formed in 2013, including in dance performances with robotic arms, or AI systems that use motion capture to mimic the steps of a live performer.
Regular contributors to Kinetech shows run the gamut from a computer scientist so stiff it looks like they can’t move their shoulders to dancers with little to no experience in technology, said Daiane Lopes de Silva, a dancer who cofounded Kinetech alongside technologist and director Weidong Yang.

Members of the group come together in order to use technology as a tool to highlight humanity, Wang said. 
That play and experimentation takes place at a weekly “open lab” gathering in San Francisco’s Mission District. Amid exercises at an open lab last year ahead of the group’s annual DanceHack show, Lopes de Silva led warmups for about 30 dancers and technologists with snaps, claps, shoulder rolls, and an order to “make magic with your hands like an alchemist.”
Lopes da Silva thinks motion capture technology can help dancers, capturing their unique style of movement and serving as a tool for self reflection. She recently used motion capture to discover that she dances more enthusiastically on her right side than her left.
The best part about humans making art with machines, Yang told dancers and technologists at an open lab ahead of DanceHack, is when things go wrong.
“Artists like glitches,” he said. “That can lead to improvisation, unexpected events that cannot be reproduced.”
Ari Kalinowski runs a lab at Gray Area, a nonprofit arts organization known for putting human dancers on the same stage as robots. He supports lawsuits against companies like Stability AI and Midjourney, which artists accuse of copyright infringement. Neither company responded to requests to comment. At the same time, he also has been working with Kinetech on AI that can mimic and interact with dancers and wants dancers to explore dancing with AI agents.

The art form can withstand integration with AI, he believes.
“People still play chess after Deep Blue beat Gary Kasparov,” he said. “We now have in addition to chess, augmented chess, and as an artist I’m not interested in replacing artists. I’m interested in expanding creativity to include human-agent interaction in different ways.”
Kate Ladenheim is an assistant professor of choreography at UCLA and self-described creative technologist. Ladenheim was once asked to choreograph a ballet about Anonymous, the hacker group, which “pointed me toward digital life as a really strong influence for my work,” Ladenheim said.
Ladenheim uses motion capture extensively and has explored the intersection of dance and technology in various other ways, including by teaching a class about modern dance as it relates to tech development, and working with a member of the Martha Graham Dance Company on a chatbot that responds in the voice of Graham, the famous dancer and choreographer.
Ladenheim said the impact of technology on dance is nothing new, and that fears about technology’s effect on labor have been around since the Industrial Revolution. Generative systems that are producing dance animations aren’t very good yet, in Ladenheim’s opinion. Still, they acknowledged that AI has the potential to get so adept that it brings up an “essential question for the field of choreography: What is the implication if we can (subtract the human) body from it?”
About half an hour away at the University of Southern California’s Glorya Kaufman School of Dance, associate professor d. Sabela grimes is facing AI head-on instead of fearing it. Many dancers have been early tech adopters, he said, embracing sampler and drum machines, and the internet as a way to share music files.
The professor encourages his dance students to use ChatGPT to help formulate questions. He also believes generative AI can help students in their choreography classes and to help teachers engage students. AI models are “going to be integrated in so many systems, so why not get ahead of it,” he said. Yet he added that there’s an important conversation to be had around “the ethics of plagiarizing people’s styles and using it for datasets.” 
Should dancers be worried about AI replacing them? It depends on what audiences and artists want, grimes said: “If people value a virtual experience vs. a human experience, there will be a danger.”
Kat Lin is a technologist who has danced since she was 3 years old and taken part in Kinetech performances since 2018. She’s never seen Kinetech do shows that didn’t involve AI in some way. Though AI or metaphors about AI are part of many Kinetech dance performances, Lin doubts that AI can easily replicate their shows because they’re often improvised and technological glitches are treated like opportunities to explore the unexpected.

There’s a lot of fearmongering today about AI taking jobs from creatives, Lin said, but she doesn’t view the relationship between AI and art as antagonistic. Humans might take inspiration from dancing with AI or learn things, like that their dance steps land heavier on their right side than their left. But Lin doesn’t believe AI is a threat to dancers’ jobs. “There’s always going to be something different about having a human stand in front of you and moving,” she said. “Nothing will ever replace that kind of energy, probably because humans are very social, and there’s just something magical to that.”
Lin said AI can’t imitate the community she enjoys at Kinetech open labs, which she has participated in since moving to San Francisco seven years ago. And it can’t mimic the connection she felt with Weidong Yang, who she met while doing a handstand. He joined her there, upside down with his legs against the wall, and she now considers him a great friend.
“I often say that getting to do dance pieces or be in rehearsal is just an excuse to hang out with friends,” she said. “Community is everything.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/091924-Zion-Harris-AI-AJ-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-21 08:56:57.532595

Claudia Gonzalez
Claudia Gonzalez is a senior program associate for the Vera Institute of Justice’s Vera California program.


When I was younger, I couldn’t imagine a future for myself beyond going to prison or dying young. 
But today, I am a college graduate and a senior policy advocate for the Vera Institute of Justice’s California team, where we promote the end of mass incarceration, protection of immigrant communities and racial justice. 
What changed my life? 
Instead of being incarcerated after my last arrest, I was granted diversion. Diversion programs keep people in their communities while they work through hours of behavioral health programs, job training and other supportive structures to break the cycle of incarceration. 
I first encountered the justice system as a child, when a family member was investigated for sexually abusing children in my family. I had heard a detective was looking for me and, though I was one of the victims, I thought I was in trouble.
On television we see child victims get escorted to a safe place, connected with therapists or social workers and treated with dignity and respect. 
In real life, I got a phone call from a detective. The police treated me like I had been the perpetrator, and I was terrified. I wasn’t seen as a victim. I was never offered any services or support. The experience — both the abuse and the investigation — haunted me and consumed my life. 
My family and I were stuck in a dangerous cycle. My father was in prison most of my life. My brother soon followed as one of the first young people sentenced to life in prison under Prop 21, which sent many juvenile offenders to adult court.
I ended up in a similar lifestyle. When I was 12 my boyfriend was attacked by a rival gang outside a 7-Eleven. He died in my arms on the way to the hospital.
Traumatized and depressed, I couldn’t get out of bed or make it to classes. My school decided the best way to solve my truancy was to have me arrested. I was ushered onto the school-to-prison pipeline instead of being offered an off-ramp.
I was in and out of jail sometimes on gang-related charges. Many other women in the correction system were like me; they had survived child sexual abuse, sexual assault or human trafficking. 
But my last arrest was different. A judge and a public defender saw in me the capacity to grow and change. 
I was enrolled in a six-month, adult school office technology program. I worked overtime to complete it in a month. It became my foundation for higher education, meaningful employment and a deeper engagement with my community. 
It led me to community college, where I got a 4.0 my first semester and was invited to the honor society and joined student government. I got into UC Berkeley with a full ride as a Regents’ and Chancellor’s Scholar, and now I have a career advocating for other women like me.
There are many of us survivors on the streets and in California’s jails and prisons who’ve been presented with little opportunity beyond incarceration or death. More need the chance I was granted. 
They want to stop the harm they suffered from happening again. If we give them an opportunity for redemption and hold each other accountable for change, we can create a future of safety, justice and hope.
Research shows diversion programs cut reoffending rates in half. 
California could have taken a step forward on that path with Assembly Bill 1231, a critical option for survivors in the criminal justice system. The bill would have allowed people charged with nonviolent felonies to get help through diversion programs, where they’d be accountable to the court and to themselves to build a different life. 
Written in close collaboration with survivors, it would’ve allowed judges to weigh mitigating factors for people surviving domestic violence, sexual assault or human trafficking and to develop diversion plans to help them change their lives, support their families and pay restitution to those they’ve harmed.
But the bill didn’t get enough votes in the Assembly after amendments and the concurrence  process. It had drawn opposition from those in law enforcement who saw punishment as the only tool to address our crime problems. 
Punishment is not prevention, and prison is not a path forward. 
Every Californian deserves a chance to become better. With opportunity and support, my story can become commonplace. We can keep each other safe and better ourselves and our communities, instead of resigning ourselves to violence, crime and a bleak future.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/021524_CIW_REENTRY_FAIR_JH_CM_00790.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-21 08:56:57.532595

None of the videos generated by the leading AI platforms showed the actual dances we requested.


Artificial intelligence models can produce lifelike video footage with a simple text prompt. But these tools still struggle with generating realistic videos of complex natural movements, like human dance. 
When CalMatters and The Markup asked dancers and choreographers about whether AI could disrupt their industry, most concluded that human dancers could not be replaced.

Read our story: Our video tests prove generative AI still sucks at dancing. See for yourself

For the most part, we found that they were right. We tested nine different cultural, modern and popular dance styles using four commercially available generative AI video models, generating a total of 36 videos. We found that the latest commercially available AI video generation models produced convincingly lifelike videos of people dancing — but none produced a figure performing the prompted dance.
About a third of the generated videos exhibited inconsistencies in a subject’s appearance from frame to frame, along with abnormalities in movement and limbs. The frequency and magnitude of issues observed were a significant improvement compared to initial testing in late 2024.
Methodology
Define task
CalMatters and The Markup tested four commercial video generation models produced by major tech companies to create video clips of traditional and popular dance.
We limited our tests to consumer-facing, closed-source generative video tools because they are the most readily available for everyday users and tend to perform better than open-source models. We tested Sora 2 by OpenAI, Veo 3.1 by Google, Kling 2.5 by Kuaishou, and Hailou 2.3 by MiniMax.
Prepare prompts
We drafted nine video prompts testing a variety of dances in different settings, such as dance floors, stages, bedrooms, studios, cultural events, public squares and classrooms. We tested for popular, modern and traditional cultural dance styles, including the Macarena, the Mashed Potato, folklorico and popular TikTok dances. See the Appendix for more details.
We varied the level of specificity to test whether identifying the dance by name was enough to generate a video of the desired motion, or whether explicitly specifying the exact physical movements improved output. 
Before finalizing the list of prompts, we submitted them to ChatGPT for edits based on the Sora 2 Prompting Guide. See Limitations: Prompt Optimization for more details.
Submit prompts for video generation
Each prompt was submitted once, using each model’s default settings for generating landscape-oriented videos. Three prompts submitted to Sora 2 were edited to remove words that triggered OpenAI’s filter, blocking prompts that may have violated “guardrails concerning similarity to third-party content.” For example, Sora 2 flagged prompts referencing specific years, popular music artists and banned words. One blocked prompt was for a video of a politician dancing the Macarena. For that prompt, replacing “politician in a suit” with “man in a suit” bypassed the guardrail. Veo 3.1 flagged similar prompts when we submitted via Gemini or Flow but did not when we submitted directly to the Veo 3.1 API.
Evaluate generated videos
We evaluated the generated videos on six different criteria related to prompt alignment and video consistency:

Did the main subject dance in any way?
Did the main subject perform the specific dance we prompted for?
Did the main subject maintain the same physical appearance throughout the video?
Did the main subject produce realistic motions based on human physiology?
Did the scene and setting match the prompt?
Did the camera match the prompted camera angle and position?

Each of the above criteria was assessed as a pass or a fail by a single reviewer, with the assistance of a second reviewer when needed. The generated videos of cultural dances were reviewed for accuracy by dancers familiar with them.
Results
Of the 36 videos generated, all but one showed a figure dancing. The one video that did not show a dancing figure — produced by Kling 2.5 — instead presented the bottom half of a figure performing side lunges.
No video produced the actual dance we prompted for. For the Cahuilla Band of Indians bird dance, tribal member Emily Clarke said, “None of these depictions are anywhere close to bird dancing, in my opinion.” The videos for the Horton dance did not show the specific dance movement we prompted for, but choreographer Emma Andre said she found the depiction by Veo 3.1 to be “staggeringly lifelike.” 
For the remaining pop culture dances, we compared the generated videos to videos we found on YouTube to evaluate whether the dance was accurate.
11 out of 36 videos exhibited issues with either motion or appearance consistency. This included sudden changes in clothing, hair or limb structure, such as heads rotating on separate axes from their bodies and limbs liquefying and reconstituting.
See the Appendix for full results and videos.
Limitations
Image-to-video generation
We did not use images to prompt the models. Image-to-video generation involves uploading a static image along with a text prompt, producing a dynamic video from both. Image-to-video generation is an advertised use case for models that produce dance videos from user-submitted images. 
Multi-subject dance videos
We did not prompt for videos with multiple dancers, even though some of the dances are often performed in groups. We limited our video prompts to showcase a single dancer to avoid ambiguity around whether a failed evaluation was due to issues with generating complex human movement or a realistic multi-subject video.
Prompt optimization
We did not optimize prompts on a per-model basis. Each company publishes its own prompt guide. (See the guidelines for Veo 3.1, Hailou 2.5, Kling 2.3, and Sora 2.) Instead, we used ChatGPT 5 to standardize prompts across models to align with the Sora 2 Prompting Guide. It’s possible that optimizing prompts for the models according to their specific guides could have yielded more accurate results.
We also tried to improve the quality of the videos by giving detailed step-by-step instructions of each dance. However, these instructions did not produce videos that were any more accurate than those produced with simpler prompts.
Human-motion generation models
We did not test generative models focused on human-motion generation. These models are used in animation and video games to generate and capture natural human motion. Researchers train some state-of-the-art academic models in this space using large datasets, including footage of popular dances on TikTok. Although these models may perform better than the consumer-facing models we tested, they require technical expertise and substantial computational resources to run.  
Sample size
Our evaluation is limited to the generated videos for nine prompts; it is not a comprehensive assessment of the models used. Some video generation benchmarks, like those from Tencent’s AI Lab and others, use several hundred prompts to test capabilities such as complex motion, multiple subjects and creative style.

Gov. Gavin Newsom is highlighting security improvements as the Trump administration accuses Democratic states of tolerating welfare fraud.,"In summary
Low-income Californians once lost millions of dollars a month to fraudsters who raided their accounts for food assistance and other public benefits. Gov. Gavin Newsom is highlighting security improvements as the Trump administration accuses Democratic states of tolerating welfare fraud. 


Two years after a wave of public benefit thefts that left low-income Californians scrambling to pay rent and afford food each month, Gov. Gavin Newsom is touting a significant decline in the reported amount stolen. 
The thefts still amounted to more than $4 million a month last fall in both the CalFresh food assistance and CalWorks cash welfare benefits programs, according to a press release from Newsom’s office. That’s down from two years ago, when public benefits recipients were reporting $20 million a month stolen from their accounts. The state uses taxpayer money to reimburse victims when they report theft. 
Newsom credited the reduction to the state’s rollout of anti-fraud technology such as more secure electronic benefit (EBT) cards with electronic chips. 
“In California, we’re leading the way by turning innovation into action by stopping theft and ensuring benefits reach those who truly need them,” he said in a press release.
Newsom’s office announced the improved theft numbers last week after the Trump administration ramped up threats to California over allegations of fraud in public benefits. The president has used a wave of prosecutions over social services fraud in Minnesota, some of it allegedly by immigrants, as a reason to send immigration agents to conduct aggressive raids in Minneapolis. 
Earlier this month the Trump administration froze some federal social services funding to five Democratic-led states, including California. A judge halted the freeze, which included funds for the CalWorks cash aid program, for now. 
The kind of fraud in which Newsom was touting reductions is not traditional “welfare fraud” perpetrated by recipients of public benefits, but rather theft by a third party. Local social services officials have said fraud by recipients is relatively uncommon. 
Thieves have been taking advantage of California benefits recipients by using hidden “skimming” devices to steal card numbers from EBT cards loaded withCalFresh food assistance and CalWorks cash welfare benefits. They then duplicate the cards and drain them of cash or make large purchases using CalFresh, before the recipients have a chance to spend their own benefits. 
California was particularly susceptible because of the size of the state’s social safety net, with roughly 300,000 families receiving cash aid and 3 million receiving food assistance. CalMatters reported in 2023 that the state, previously focused on detecting fraud committed by recipients of the benefits, had also ignored warnings and delayed a proposal to introduce chipped EBT cards.
When the pandemic brought new benefits from the federal and state governments, such as boosted unemployment benefits and stimulus checks, thieves wielding card skimmers followed the money. EBT cards, which contained only a magnetic strip at the time, were among the most vulnerable to theft. Nearly 200 people have been charged across California in the EBT schemes, Newsom’s office said.
Since 2023 the state responded to the skimming crisis by issuing chipped EBT cards and introducing an app allowing recipients to freeze their EBT accounts to prevent withdrawals. Last year, Newsom said, the state began using a computer model to detect fraudulent withdrawals and forced resets of some CalWorks’ recipients EBT card PINs. 
But local welfare fraud investigators said the Newsom’s numbers paint too rosy a picture of the theft. 
Gregory Mahony, president of the California Welfare Fraud Investigators Association, said he believes the state’s reported thefts are undercounted.
The figures are based on how much the state reimburses county welfare departments each month to return victims’ benefits. But some recipients don’t bother making a report, or report months of thefts but only get some of the money reimbursed, Mahony said. 
He also criticized the California Department of Social Services for dropping a requirement in 2023 that victims file police reports each time their benefits are stolen in order to get a reimbursement. That’s hurt the state’s tracking of theft and fraud, Mahony said. 
“This is not a systemic victory,” he said in a statement. “It is a delayed and partial mitigation of a crisis long allowed to grow unchecked.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/012026-EBT-SCG-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-21 08:56:57.532595

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Former Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius stepped forward Wednesday to endorse state Sen. Ethan Corson’s campaign for the Democratic Party’s nomination for governor.
The August primary has evolved into a contest between Corson, of Fairway, and state Sen. Cindy Holscher, of Overland Park.
Sebelius, who was the state’s Democratic governor from 2003 to 2009, stepped down to accept appointment as secretary of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. She served five years in the Cabinet of President Barack Obama.
Sebelius said her endorsement of Corson reflected appreciation for his bipartisan record, leadership, focus on helping families and support for public schools, accessible health care and job expansion.
“Right now, Kansas families are working hard to keep up,” Sebelius said in a statement. “They want a little more breathing room. They want our public schools to stay strong. They want health care they can afford. And, they want leaders who focus on solutions and results. That’s why I’m proud to endorse Ethan Corson for governor.”

Sebelius said Corson understood challenges faced by Kansans dealing with rising costs, the need to make cities and towns thrive and the necessity of farmers’ to secure access to global markets.
“Ethan is calm under pressure,” the former governor said. “He listens first. He works with both parties, gets results, leads with integrity and stays focused on what matters most to Kansas families.”
Corson, an attorney who was first elected to the state Senate in 2020, said he appreciated Sebelius’s track record of providing “steady, bipartisan leadership.”
“I’m running to help Kansas families keep more of what they earn, give our schools the support they need and help every community compete and succeed. This campaign is about bringing people from both parties together to deliver results,” Corson said.
In November, Gov. Laura Kelly endorsed Corson. He launched his campaign for the nomination in July — one month after Holscher announced her bid.
Last week, Holscher’s campaign shared polling that indicated she was “the clear frontrunner” with a double-digit advantage among likely Democratic primary voters. Corson’s campaign finance report indicated he generated more than $900,000 in contributions during 2025, while Holscher took in $400,000 by Dec. 31.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/P1090663-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-21 08:56:57.532595

(Will Ruzanski/Utah News Dispatch)The first day of the Utah Legislature’s 2026 general session drew multiple demonstrations to Capitol Hill, with activists rallying around issues ranging from immigration enforcement and the war in Gaza to the Great Salt Lake and support for nonprofit organizations. 
Protesting ICE
Protesters gathered on the Capitol steps at sunset to rally against Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in a demonstration organized by Utah’s Party for Socialism and Liberation. The event drew roughly 500 protesters, according to the Utah Highway Patrol. 
Adrian Rolins, an organizer with PSL, said the protest was meant “to send a political message to the Legislature that we are here.”

“We know what’s going on, and we are willing to fight for our neighbors’ rights, for their civil, human and democratic constitutional rights,” he said. He emphasized the protest was meant to provide support “for American citizens (and) immigrants, regardless of their documentation status.”
“PSL’s message for the Utah state Legislature is, ‘stop supporting ICE.’ Don’t allow ICE to come and continue to do operations in this state,” Rolins added. He said PSL wants to “motivate people in the working class to start organizing for a general strike.”
“A general strike looks like labor unions and people from all over the country collectively striking. Not going to work, refusing to do what is necessary to make the country run. We have that sort of power in our hands, and we can utilize it to foment a people’s movement to stop ICE, to stop the support of ICE and the funding of ICE.”
PSL organizer Christopher Loera-Peña is also calling for a general strike.

“This is incredibly powerful because it demonstrates the power that working people have,” Loera-Peña said. “We make this country run. If every single worker in Salt Lake City didn’t show up for a day, the entire economy of this city would come to a halt.”
He explained that the Utah PSL chapter’s desire for a general strike is part of a broader, national movement. 
“We’re here to stand in solidarity with Minneapolis,” he said. “They’re calling for a city-wide general strike on Friday, and this is the exact type of response that Trump can expect from working people if he does not end this racist terrorizing of our communities.”
‘Freedom march’
Roughly 300 protesters gathered on the Capitol steps at 2 p.m. for the “free America walkout,” a Women’s March rally. Protesters cited concern over Trump’s handling of the Epstein files, immigration enforcement, money in politics, and what many described as a rise in authoritarianism across the U.S.
The We The People’s Movement also contributed to planning the protest.
Nicole Kunz, a demonstrator at the rally who came dressed in a green gown turning lyrics from the Broadway hit “Wicked” into a message against tyranny, said she was protesting immigration enforcement along with the killing of Renee Good, a 37-year old woman who was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis.

“I’m here because I’m sick and tired of Congress not standing up for the people,” she said. “I think it’s disgusting that the terrorist organization known as ICE is walking around our streets, kidnapping and killing people.”
She also expressed her concern with the Legislature’s handling of Utah’s ongoing redistricting saga. 
“They don’t listen to us, we voted to make our maps. They don’t like it because they like to control everything,” she said. “They don’t like when the people get to have a voice. And so now they’re doing everything they can to gerrymander us yet again, and we’re sick of it.”
Kunz referenced the delayed release of files pertaining to deceased sex trafficker Jefferey Epstein, and his alleged connections to powerful politicians and businesspeople. “I think it’s insane that Trump’s DOJ doesn’t have to be held accountable,” she said. “They’re 30 days past when they were supposed to bring everything to the table.”

Charlie Padilla also protested the Trump administration’s handling of files from the investigation into Epstein. 
“We need to release the Epstein files and hold predators accountable, especially those in power that use their wealth and influence to take advantage of children,” he said. “It’s impacted and infested every level of government, every level of business, and we have to … prevent these atrocities from taking place against our children.”
Padilla, with the We The People’s Movement, called the protest necessary to prevent a rise in authoritarianism. “In order for us to do something about it, to stop the wave of fascism that we’re experiencing, we have to take collective action,” he said. “We have to get out, use our voices and make sure that we organize in order to bring about real change.”
Gaza protest
Earlier in the day, demonstrators gathered in the Hall of Governors inside the Capitol to read the names of children killed in Gaza. Organized by Utahns for a Just Peace in the Holy Land, the protest lasted three hours. 
Gail Boling, a protest organizer, said she believes “Utahns have responsibility” for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. “The American taxpayers have helped fund this genocide in Gaza,” she said, referencing the $17.9 billion in U.S. military funding sent to Israel in 2024. 
“We think that the legislature can have a role to play in helping shape foreign policy,” she said, encouraging Utah’s legislators to “influence congressional representatives who can also help shape foreign policy.”

Sen. Nate Blouin, D-Salt Lake City, was among lawmakers who joined the protest, calling to terminate U.S. military aid for Israel. Rep. Raymond Ward, R-Davis, also participated in reading names. 
“I don’t think we should be involved in aiding and abetting a genocide, and that is what we are doing,” Blouin said. “It’s critical that we are able to raise the awareness of people to get involved at the state level.”
Members of the 71 Percent Coalition, a pro-Palestinian organization, also joined the protest. Among them was Mustafa Khader, a Palestinian American.
“We want to emphasize that the genocide in Gaza did not stop, despite, the ceasefire,” Khader said. “The killing and the abuse is going on.”
Nonprofits rally
The Utah Nonprofits Association rallied on the Capitol steps in a nonpartisan demonstration to draw “positive attention” to Utah’s nonprofits.
“We want to start this session with the people on the ground, the hard-working nonprofit service providers, the educators, the helpers in mind,” said Saru Ramanan, chief growth officer for the Utah Nonprofits Association. 
She pointed to the community-based work that nonprofits do in Utah. “I think far too often, people don’t realize that nonprofit organizations are the ones delivering meals, responding to crises, showing up for communities and Utahns in need.”
Ramanan emphasized the importance of their rally landing on the first day of the 2026 legislative session, calling for “no barriers to nonprofits accessing vital funding, continued support for community-based organizations, and broad local partnership between legislators and the organizations in their communities.” She noted that the event was not a protest.

The commission in November voted to maintain PBS programming through the end of its contract in June after two commissioners suggested dropping the programming citing the current administration’s budget cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) this summer. 
The idea of dropping PBS drew sharp criticism from PBS supporters, and Gov. Kay Ivey urged the board to delay a decision on the issue. Following the commission’s decision to maintain its PBS contract in November, APT’s membership at the end of the year was over 25,800. Chief Financial Officer Melissa Austin said during the Alabama Educational Television Foundation Authority meeting the number is a “nearly 2,500 member increase” from October.
Ivey’s proposed 2027 Education Trust Fund budget recommends a $10.8 million budget for fiscal year 2027, a 1.45% increase from the commission’s appropriation in fiscal year 2026.
Jack Williams, director of external affairs for APT, said Tuesday that a letter advocating for funding restoration was written by himself and signed by himself and other general managers in 19 other red states, then sent to Republican Senators in the U.S. Congress. 
“When the President proposed the rescission package he voiced his concern about the political leanings of NPR and PBS. The goal seemed to be to find a way to minimize or silence the messaging coming from these two national organizations,” the letter reads. “We are not seeking to undo the rescission, just to find a way to save local stations.”
Arkansas’ educational television network board voted in December to pull PBS from their public television station and rebrand as Arkansas TV. Reid said APT will watch the impact of Arkansas’ decision on that state before making a decision in June.
“There’s some similarities and some differences. I don’t think they have the legislative support that we have here in Alabama, (the) governor’s support we have here in Alabama,” Reid said. “So for us, I think it gives us an opportunity to see what happens there when they make some of these changes, because there could be some radical drops in membership and funding for them that could be a good indicator for us and what to do next.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_0222-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-21 08:56:57.532595

(Photo courtesy Center for Biological Diversity)A conservation group is preparing to sue the federal government for failing to make a decision on whether to list a rare Nevada toad and fish as an endangered or threatened species.
On Tuesday, the Center for Biological Diversity notified the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service of their intent to sue the agency for allegedly violating the Endangered Species Act after federal wildlife managers failed to issue a timely 12-month finding on whether to list the Amargosa toad and the Oasis Valley speckled dace, as required by federal law.
“The Amargosa toad and Oasis Valley speckled dace are small but powerful symbols of the remarkable biodiversity that makes Nevada so special. At this point the Endangered Species Act is their last line of defense,” said Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement.
Last year, a review by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found there was substantial evidence that both the toad and fish may be eligible for listing, after the Center filed petitions to protect both species under the Endangered Species Act. 
The Amargosa toad and Oasis Valley speckled dace live in spring-fed habitats along the Amargosa River in Oasis Valley near Beatty in Nye County. The Amargosa toad is only found along a 14 mile stretch of the Amargosa River, with a population estimated at about 2,000 individuals.
According to the petitions, both the rare toad and fish are threatened with extinction due to groundwater pumping from seven proposed gold mining operations along the Amargosa. Six of those projects are being proposed by British multinational miner AngloGold Ashanti, including what is potentially the largest greenfield gold discovery in Nevada in more than a decade.
AngloGold Ashanti has claimed their Arthur Gold Deposit in could contain about 16 million ounces of gold resources, nearly five times as much gold as Nevada produces annually.
AngloGold Ashanti’s North Bullfrog Project, which is currently in the permitting phase, is about nine miles north of the Town of Beatty. The project would span about 5,400 acres of public lands and would withdraw up to 2,500 acre-feet of water per year from Oasis Valley, perhaps enough to serve about 7,500 homes.
“We won’t stand idly by and watch a mining company imperil the Amargosa River and push these special animals toward extinction so its shareholders can make a buck,” Donnelly said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/RSAmargosa-toad-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-21 08:56:57.532595

(Courtesy of South Dakota Highway Patrol)At the start of Tuesday’s House Transportation Committee meeting in Pierre, a legislative page introduced himself at the urging of the committee’s chairman.
He’s a senior at Rapid City Stevens High School, he said, and intends to pursue a career in law enforcement after graduation.
About 15 minutes later, Department of Public Safety Secretary Bob Perry told the committee “we’d like to talk to him when we’re done.”
The state Highway Patrol has struggled mightily to maintain staffing levels in recent years, Perry said during his informational briefing to the committee. And the agency’s 23 openings are weighted heavily in the rural enclaves of “West River,” the part of South Dakota west of the Missouri River. The state patrol is authorized to employ 210 troopers.
The state added a squad of troopers to the Sioux Falls area last year, and Perry said all nine of those positions were easily filled.
Positions stationed in places like Faith, a town of 350, tend to go unfilled for months or years. 
Growth in Sioux Falls prompts governor to add Highway Patrol troopers

With West River recruitment efforts, Perry said, “we’re at wrestling tournaments, we’re at basketball tournaments. We’re anywhere we can get the word out.”
“These are high school level events, but we’re targeting older brothers, older sisters, mothers, fathers,” Perry said. “It’s not that we’re there to target the high school kids, although we do want to get it in their mind.”
As of 2025, the patrol began recruiting two classes a year instead of one. That’s put 11 more recruits into the pipeline in the monthslong process of hiring and training.
The imbalance in recruiting success between the eastern and western sides of South Dakota is a measure of high demand for law enforcement officers in and out of South Dakota. Decades ago, when Perry signed on to be a state trooper, trainers would post a list of openings around week eight in the training.
“They’d walk out of the room, and everyone had to figure it out,” he said.
The state can’t do that anymore, he said. Now, recruits know where they’ll go the day they’re hired.
“If you tell someone who wants to go to Sioux Falls that they’re going to go to Faith, they’re going to say no, and they’re going to pursue opportunities,” Perry said. 
The next hiring cycle begins in March, Perry said. Despite the struggles in the west, he told the committee, the department has been pleased with its recruitment efforts in terms of sheer numbers. The last three classes of recruits have each had more than 10 members, he said, which hadn’t happened since 2020.

(Photo: Pamela Tsigdinos/Nevada Current)Nevada’s interim Legislative Committee for the Review and Oversight of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) and the Marlette Lake Water System meets in Carson City on January 23 at a moment when funding is scarce, policy decisions carry outsized consequences, and TRPA’s regulatory capture has allowed private interests and their lobbyists to shape the basin’s priorities more than the public they’re supposed to serve. 
Two-thirds of Lake Tahoe, one of the deepest lakes in the world, lies within California’s borders, yet when it comes to oversight of the lake and the bi-state TRPA, Nevada consistently punches above its weight.  Despite California contributing twice as much to TRPA’s budget – including new appropriations even as TRPA leaders approved raises for themselves ) – it was Nevada’s legislature that created a statutory TRPA oversight committee in 2003.  With no comparable mechanism in California, Nevada holds a leadership role in shaping the agency’s accountability.
Against this backdrop, you might assume unity is impossible across Tahoe’s distinct mountainous basin communities, yet talk to any of the 55,000 residents from the five surrounding lake counties and you’ll hear the same message: Lake Tahoe – listed on the EPA’s website as “impaired” –  must be safeguarded for generations to come. There is also shared conviction that public safety must be a top priority.  
Under the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact, TRPA has a statutory duty to protect public health and safety through basin-wide planning, yet agency leadership continues to frame wildfire evacuation as a county responsibility even though fire behavior, traffic flow, and resident and visitor movement cross every jurisdictional boundary. 
A chorus of concerned voices, an independent study and media analysis called for a coordinated, actionable ‘no knock’ region-wide evacuation plan with a detailed capacity study necessary to understand how hundreds of thousands of visitors and residents could safely exit via the basin’s few two-lane roads. What resulted in 2024 was a press release and cobbled together evacuation framework presented as a ‘living document’ that hasn’t been updated since. 
Further, Tahoe sits on active fault lines and within double-hazard wildfire zones, which elevate the need for a robust evacuation plan. Yet TRPA charged ahead to loosen ordinances that increase density and worsen evacuation chokepoints. Even Nevada’s Secretary of State last month directed a no vote on the Washoe Tahoe Area Plan after hearing Tahoe residents’ concerns. The committee should also ask why the Washoe County Commissioner on TRPA’s board pushed changes through locally over her constituents’ objections. 
Oversight, please
Also at issue is whether the agency created to uphold the 1969 Tahoe Compact to ensure the Lake’s clarity and environmental health is now merely paying lip service to its mission “to exercise effective environmental conservation.”  Evidence is mounting that TRPA’s public relations campaigns, events, websites, newsletters and press releases exaggerate reality. One long-time Tahoe resident, a former data analyst, crunched the numbers and discovered that while TRPA’s budget has increased 41 percent in the past 10 years, Lake Tahoe clarity has deteriorated by 15 percent. 
The agency has invested more resources and energy ‘performing’ progress than delivering it.  This comes from the top. Some 20 years ago TRPA’s former chief of communications and legislative affairs, now the agency’s Executive Director, won the top public relations award for a 75-page full-color report on the agency’s Environmental Improvement Program and 30-minute DVD on the story of the program. Anyone who’s worked in communications or advertising knows these programs, plus TRPA’s newsletters, collateral and media work don’t come cheap.  
There’s a general PR principle: if you’re doing things right, your results speak for themselves. Further, if an organization’s leadership prioritizes ‘visioning’ to court private interests the organization is probably diverting resources from its core work: science and data-based analysis. And that remains a problem for Lake Tahoe.
Accountability critical for public trust
At the August 2024 interim committee meeting, after repeated requests made from the public and oversight committee members, TRPA’s executive director committed on the record to deliver an environmental update. Crickets ensued. In October 2024, the committee chair asked again for data prior to the 2025 legislative session. What resulted in December 2024 from the TRPA was a non-answer, a dissembling collection of paragraphs that no scientific body (or high school science fair for that matter) would accept as anything other than an exercise in obfuscation. 
A good place for Nevada’s new committee to start? Join the public in demanding substantive scientific and environmental data – not vague charts and aspirational promises. Examine whether TRPA has a comprehensive basin-wide evacuation plan capable of supporting the agency’s grand vision to urbanize town centers with six story or taller buildings, eliminate parking requirements for multi-story developments, and require residents and visitors to walk or bike on steep roads and paths that receive feet of snow in the winter. Is any of this remotely practical or safe? 
The agency insists there is a growth cap yet its plans call for more buildings and more people. How does that logic hold? When TRPA’s staff report admits the economics still favor higher-value housing even with reforms it’s hard to see the “workforce housing” label as anything but a distraction. The obvious first step—restricting short-term rentals in the Tahoe basin—never seems to make TRPA’s agenda. 
TRPA will tell the oversight committee that it is balancing many needs and partner requests. But those “needs” and wish lists, often originating from corporations, real estate investors, luxury developers, and tourism agencies—deserve far more scrutiny, The agency’s recent approvals speak for themselves: lakefront luxury hotel redevelopments; upscale glamping; ski resort expansions. 
So, the real question is this: are TRPA’s latest housing and transportation demands a disguised bid to make the public subsidize lodging and shuttles for J-1 workers serving resorts and high-end developments? How can Tahoe’s limited infrastructure support denser development and unlimited tourists? Where, exactly, will money come from to support first responders already stretched to the breaking point?
New leadership needed
If past performance is any indication, this newly formed committee should toss out its 2024 playbook. It allowed the TRPA to collaborate with hand-selected “partners” – tourism agencies and corporate-funded nonprofits) to present dog and pony shows and host tours that excluded the public. 
Despite spending more than $3 billion dollars in recent decades and touting dozens of partners, including some tied to public companies, the agency is perpetually seeking more money, TBID revenue, and grants.  Meanwhile, algae blooms, microplastics, pesticides, invasive species and toxins are increasing while wildlife habitat continues to degrade under new parking lots and asphalt trail construction. The questions practically ask themselves: 

Where is the return on investment after billions have been spent? 
Why does the agency continue to defy a court order prohibiting chemicals in the lake?
Why does observable pollution above and below the lake’s surface continue to trend in the wrong direction, along with independent environmental assessments? 
Why does TRPA ignore repeated notices from California’s attorney general about missed vehicle miles traveled targets? 
And with Lake Tahoe’s health no longer its central focus, is TRPA now taking cues from corporate partners, developers, tourism agencies and benevolent-sounding nonprofits funded by resort operators and investors?  

In short, the public relies on Nevada’s oversight not only to respect and protect Lake Tahoe, but to ensure that corporate interests, lobbyists, luxury developers, and an agency suffering from regulatory capture are held accountable. Transparency matters: offering the public a seat at the table means little if the real decisions continue to happen out of view. The people who know the lake best—not those seeking to exploit it—should be the ones mapping Tahoe’s future.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Washoe-Tahoe.North-Lake-Tahoe-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-21 08:56:57.532595

SB 128, sponsored by Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, also extends the commission until October 2030. Coleman-Madison said moving the commission under ADPH’s oversight will increase access to care for patients with sickle cell. 
“Right now, they spend a lot of money traveling throughout the state. There are three major sickle cell officers in the state,” Coleman-Madison said. “The key thing is that they are not reaching as many people as they could because they’re not accessible.”

A message seeking comment from the Sickle Cell Oversight and Regulatory Commission was left Tuesday afternoon. 
The commission was created to “insure the delivery of sickle cell services pursuant to … affected persons in all counties in Alabama and assist in establishing geographical service delivery boundaries,” according to its website. It is funded through the Education Trust Fund budget. The commission is slated to receive $1.9 million this year.  
Sickle cell anemia is one of a group of inherited disorders known as sickle cell disease that affects the shape of red blood cells, which carry oxygen to all parts of the body. According to the Mayo Clinic, the disease changes the shape of red blood cells, which slows the transportation of oxygen.
An estimated 5,000 Alabamians suffer from sickle-cell anemia, according to Children’s of Alabama. According to the CDC, there were 256 babies born with sickle cell disease in Alabama between 2016 and 2020. Sickle cell disease affects about 100,000 Americans, with more than 90% being non-Hispanic Black or African-American, according to the CDC.
“It’s one of those rare diseases, but not quite as rare, because it does impact people of color,” Coleman-Madison said. 
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most patients with sickle cell disease reported having a hard time finding care and feeling dismissed when they got care. According to the commission’s website, there are three sickle cell specialized clinics in the state.
“By there being an office in just about every county, they would have access to this,” Coleman-Madison said. “I think it’s a great thing administratively. They would be able to handle those things they need to have, and have the supplies.”
The bill passed 26-0 with an amendment from Sen. Sam Givhan, R-Huntsville, that streamlines the confirmation process to the commission.

She immediately inherited a debate over two immigrant rights bills her predecessor vetoed.,"Gov. Mikie Sherrill giving her inaugural address at New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark on Jan. 20, 2026. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)In her first hours as New Jersey’s 57th governor, Mikie Sherrill inherited the unresolved debate over whether the state should codify and expand protections for undocumented immigrants after her predecessor let the legislation that would have done so die without his signature.
Outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy’s decision to veto two of three immigrant protection bills handed to him by the Legislature last week — bills that would have, among other things, restricted when local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration agents — angered immigrant advocates who immediately began urging lawmakers to reintroduce the bills and send them to Sherrill (D) for her signature.
“It feels like a slap in the face when our communities were championing and the whole state was championing for these to pass,” said Viri Martinez of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice. “For him to just not meet the moment, it’s so disappointing. For the Sherrill administration, we need leadership. Point blank, period, we need leadership.”
Assemblywoman Ellen Park (D-Bergen), who sponsored the three bills, said that as an immigrant herself, the measures were “deeply personal.” Park said she plans to reintroduce the two vetoed bills for Sherrill’s consideration.
“While these bills were not signed into law this time, our efforts do not end here,” Park said in a statement.
The state attorney general’s Immigrant Trust Directive, an order signed in 2018, is aimed at barring state and local police from aiding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in civil immigration enforcement.
Immigrant advocates have long pushed for the Legislature to make the directive law, arguing that a future attorney general could unilaterally rescind the directive. They renewed that push after Donald Trump became president again and initiated a mass deportation effort.
A bill to codify the directive languished in the Legislature. Earlier this month, another version of the bill was introduced that would have codified the directive and approved additional protections for immigrants. A second bill introduced alongside that one would have created data privacy protections when residents share personal data to receive public services, like at hospitals and libraries. The third bill in the package requires the Attorney General’s Office to designate specific locations where immigration enforcement will be barred.
Murphy (D) vetoed the first two and signed the third, arguing that the bill to codify the 2018 directive could open the state up to judicial scrutiny and leave the directive vulnerable. He argued that the data privacy bill needed to be amended to avoid conflicting with federal law.
Because Murphy left office on Tuesday and the bills passed in the legislative session that ended last week, the Legislature cannot vote to override Murphy’s vetoes.

The 11-member Latino legislative caucus said in a statement that the vetoed bills were “developed in direct response to concerns raised by our communities.” They noted that some law enforcement officials support the directive’s aims, saying it allows for victims and witnesses of crimes to speak to police without fear of retribution over their immigration status.
“We look forward to continued dialogue with the Sherrill Administration and legislative partners to address the concerns raised and to pursue solutions that reflect the needs of New Jersey’s diverse communities,” they said.
It’s unclear what Sherrill would do if the two vetoed bills pass the Legislature again and make it to her desk. When she was campaigning for governor last year, Sherrill expressed the same kind of concern about codifying the Immigrant Trust Directive that Murphy did on Tuesday. Her office declined to comment.
Nedia Morsy is the executive director of Make the Road New Jersey, an immigration and labor advocacy group based in Elizabeth. She’s hopeful the Sherrill administration will see the “rapidly changing circumstances” across the country as a push to revisit support for codifying the directive.
She said this could be an opportunity for lawmakers to weigh whether to add new protections to the bills, noting that immigrant agents’ tactics are escalating nationwide.
“We weren’t successful in this way, but there’s still so much opportunity — there is momentum to do more,” she said. “We definitely don’t want to lose that.”

The Alabama Public Library Service last week voted to withhold money from Fairhope Public Library over the presence of 10 books in a teen section that the board chair deemed sexually explicit. (Catherine McQueen/Getty Images)About an hour and a half into last week’s Alabama Public Library Service board meeting, one simple question from Fairhope Public Library Director Robert Gourlay captured the frustrations that have slung back and forth for more than a year between the APLS and the chief thorn in its side, the Fairhope library.
How can a library know whether it is in compliance with state code?
The question might sound like a snooze, but the underlying topic is fraught.
At the point when Gourlay posed his question, the APLS board had just voted 3-2 to not restore Fairhope’s state funding, which has been suspended since last March over allegations that the library has failed to remove sexually explicit books from its teen section – and, hence, that it is not in compliance with the state’s Administrative Code. Last year, the loss of funding meant $22,000 down the drain for Fairhope. If the APLS keeps the tap turned off, the library could lose twice as much money this year. Tens of thousands of dollars hinge on the answer to Gourlay’s question.
Throughout the meeting, board chairman John Wahl insisted that the rules and definitions around the topic are clear. And at first glance, the stuffy layers of bureaucracy that enshroud those rules might indeed be mistaken for clarity. In 2024, the APLS spearheaded changes to the state code, tasking local library boards with creating guidelines for keeping “sexually explicit” and “inappropriate” content out of minors’ sections. It all looks very official, right there in black and white.
The problem? The code fails to define what those words actually mean, and conflicting definitions abound.
It’s tempting to say libraries should just use common sense to examine challenged books. How hard could it possibly be to determine whether a text is sexually explicit? But that’s the beauty of literature: Authors can deploy the poetry of metaphor, of insinuation, of stagecraft, to write about difficult subjects with exquisite delicacy. In “Speak,” a novel that has been challenged at the Fairhope Public Library, author Laurie Halse Anderson includes two scenes of sexual assault.
Both scenes are terrifying, intensely physical, and not at all graphic. Would they count as sexually explicit? I would say no. Clearly, whoever challenged the book would argue otherwise.
A memo that Wahl circulated in May 2025 aimed to more fully nail down the definition of “sexually explicit.” It didn’t exactly clear things up, though, instead raising questions about how an informal document such as a memo could possibly act as a substitute for a legal requirement.
Then there’s the word “inappropriate,” an adjective so vague and subjective that even the APLS board seems to avoid invoking it in discussions about challenged materials. Every family in Alabama has a little bit of different idea of what might be appropriate for a teenager. In the face of all those differing opinions, who becomes the final arbiter when a book is challenged? It isn’t the local library board – if it were, the APLS would have been satisfied with Fairhope’s local review of challenged materials and reinstated the library’s funding. Failing that, does the unelected Wahl (also the state GOP chairman) get to become, as fellow APLS board member Ronald Snider has repeatedly asked, Alabama’s “censor-in-chief?”
In lieu of clear policies, Wahl came to Thursday’s board meeting bearing packets of excerpts that he personally found objectionable from the 10 books at the nucleus of the Fairhope controversy. At the top of the discussion, Wahl underscored his disapproval by announcing a tally of swear words (which state code does not prohibit) collated from the stack of books. “A-S-S,” he noted, spelling it out, “was used 120 times.” He repeatedly pressed Gourlay and Fairhope library board chairwoman Randal Wright to defend the books.
The Fairhope locals steered clear of those weeds. They weren’t there to debate the merits of cherry-picked passages stripped of their context. Over the course of many months’ worth of treks up to Montgomery, they had already articulated their own defense and worked toward resolution by re-reviewing, and in some cases reshelving, embattled titles. Instead, they simply awaited the final determination of the board.
Yet even as it became clear that the APLS board was charging toward a negative outcome for Fairhope, board members tripped over each other with contradictions. They casually disagreed about whether the Fairhope library needed to reshelve all 10 of the challenged books, particularly “Beyond Magenta,” which Wahl and Kasandra Stevens said didn’t seem sexually explicit even as Amy Minton insisted that it needed to be moved.
Then, when Gourlay tried to clarify whether any conversation about sexuality qualifies as sexually explicit, Stevens explained that to count as sexually explicit, a scene would have to actually describe a sex act, after which Wahl gave an entirely different answer, saying that if a text included any words from the bulleted list in his May 2025 memo, it would count as explicit, even if it wasn’t particularly descriptive.
Got that?
Instead of stopping to resolve those contradictions, the board ignored them and kept chugging blithely along, leaving the Fairhope representatives no more enlightened about how on earth to comply with the state’s regulations.
The Fairhope library could simply give up and move all 10 challenged books (except, presumably, “Beyond Magenta”?) into the adult section to release itself from this bureaucratic nightmare. But even if it opted for the easy way out, the library would not find resolution. Another round of code changes is working its way through the guts of Alabama’s legislative system. If the Legislature codifies it without any changes, it will go into effect on Feb. 14, barring depictions of transgender people from libraries’ youth sections. “Beyond Magenta” will find itself once again caught up in APLS’ dragnet, along with any books that include “gender ideology” — another critically important term the board has failed to define.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gettyimages-2148912235-1024x640.jpg,,,2026-01-21 07:57:18.929658

Nancy Mace speaks to reporters after a bond hearing at the Greenville Detention Center on Friday, May 16, 2025. (Photo by Mark Susko/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)An Indianapolis woman faces prison time for threatening to kill U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace and blow up her office, the 1st District congresswoman told reporters Tuesday.
A spokesperson for Mace shared a Jan. 14 news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Indiana which said Shayla Addison, 28, had been charged with two counts of influencing a federal official by threat.
Addison has agreed to plead guilty, according to court records.
Prosecutors accuse Addison of sending threatening messages last January to a representative’s campaign phone number and email and posting additional threats to social media, according to the release.
It did not identify the representative. A spokesperson for Mace shared screenshots of messages that matched quotes in the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s release.
According to the release, the threatening text messages included “we’ll kill you” and “tread lightly,” and an email threatened to “kill you and blow that whole building up.”
William Dazey Jr., who is listed as Addison’s attorney, did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment.
According to a plea agreement, the government agreed to recommend a sentence on the “low end” of the range the court calculated, after reviewing all of the evidence, in exchange for Addison’s guilty plea.
Mace, one of five Republicans running for governor, told reporters Tuesday that she’s faced an uptick in death threats in the last year and a half and, as a result, was afraid to go to the grocery store or get out of a car.
“I basically live in hiding,” she said.
To explain that uptick, she blamed political rhetoric that encourages violence.
“I also think that it’s because I am a conservative woman, and I do speak out about women’s issues, particularly on the transgender stuff,” she said.
Last April, while addressing the Greenville County GOP convention, Mace said she was among the targets of a Pennsylvania man who had been charged the week before with threatening to kill President Donald Trump and other officials.
Mace told the crowd that U.S. Capitol Police had called to inform her that the suspect, Shawn Monper, had threatened to kill her in an online post in January 2025.
Fox News was the first to report, citing an unnamed source, that Monper had posted threats against Mace specifically. She then told reporters at the convention before taking the stage to address the crowd. U.S. Capitol Police declined to comment.
A month later, the State Law Enforcement Division charged a 19-year-old transgender woman with threatening Mace by posting to X: “I’m going to assassinate (redacted) with a gun and I’m being 100% dead a–.” It was posted days after the congresswoman’s contentious exchange with a transgender student at the University of South Carolina went viral.
SLED redacted the victim’s name, but Mace identified herself as the victim.
The then-19-year-old Greenville resident, who SLED says admitted to making the post, has been in the Greenville County jail since May and was denied bond for a third time in December.
House Ethics review
Mace’s news conference came days after the bipartisan House Ethics Committee released a short statement about a review of the congresswoman, without giving any specifics whatsoever.
According to the Friday release, the committee received a referral about Mace from the Office of Congressional Conduct, an independent ethics watchdog, in December. The ethics committee plans to announce a “course of action” by March 2.
The release emphasized that its announcement “does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred.”
When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Mace referred the SC Daily Gazette to a letter posted online in December in which an attorney for Mace criticized the Office of Congressional Conduct.
The office had made claims about Mace’s “lodging expenses and reimbursement practices,” according to the letter. The letter said those claims were based on “unverified assertions and materials that may have originated from, or been influenced by, Rep. Mace’s former fiancé.”
In a fiery House floor speech in February, Mace accused four men, including her former fiancé Patrick Bryant, of sexually assaulting women as well as underage girls and secretly recording the abuse. Mace, who broke up with Bryant in late 2023, said she realized while looking through his phone that she was one of the victims. All four men have repeatedly and vehemently denied the allegations.
Lawsuits and counter-lawsuits followed.
In late November, Judge Donald Hocker issued a sweeping gag order barring Bryant, Mace, and others involved in the litigation from speaking or posting about one another or the lawsuits. The order was put in the public court record on Dec. 9, a week before Mace’s lawyer issued a response to the Office of Congressional Conduct on her behalf.
When reached by the SC Daily Gazette on Tuesday, Bryant declined to comment, citing the gag order.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cain-Bond-Hearing-Nancy-Mace-8-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-21 08:56:57.532595

(Photos by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer) The week before an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good in south Minneapolis, her 67-year-old neighbor Terri Sullivan heard that a school in nearby Richfield that serves mostly Latino students needed volunteers to keep an eye out for ICE during dropoff and pickup. Sullivan offered to help out.
A few days later, an agent killed Good, and the federal government sent more agents to Minnesota. Now, the students aren’t going to school for fear of ICE, Sullivan said.
So she attended an “upstander” training Monday hosted by Monarca, an offshoot of the political organization Unidos MN dedicated to tracking ICE actions and helping detainees.
“If we’re not doing something, we really are bystanders,” Sullivan said. “Doing nothing isn’t okay.”
She’s one of the thousands of Minnesotans who have joined the effort to observe and protest ICE actions in Minnesota since their presence ramped up in December and January. 
The resistance is omnipresent in the Twin Cities. Businesses are hanging signs in the windows barring ICE from entering the property. At immigrant-owned restaurants, citizens are volunteering to work the doors or stand guard on the sidewalk to prevent ICE from entering private property without a warrant. Outside of schools, volunteers in fluorescent vests are scanning passing cars for signs of ICE agents, hoping to provide some protection — or at least reassurance — for parents picking up and dropping off their children.
Neighborhood group chats dedicated to tracking ICE movements regularly reach capacity at 1,000 members. Monarca is looking for bigger venues to host their trainings. Churches are undertaking the massive logistical challenge of feeding thousands of immigrant families who fear leaving their homes. Coffee shops, bars and hardware stores are selling or handing out whistles for people to blow when they spot ICE.
It’s clear on the ground that in the deep-blue Twin Cities, federal agents — 3,000 strong — are far outnumbered by the people who want them out.

No longer operating in the dark
Six minutes after Will Stancil pulled out of the street parking spot near his apartment building, an unmarked grey SUV turned on its lights and parked sideways in the middle of an Uptown Minneapolis street, blocking the path of the tan GMC SUV in front of Stancil.
Before Stancil could even hop out of his car, two people on a nearby sidewalk started blowing whistles. Stancil joined them, pulling out his phone to film as he exited his Honda Fit. Another person ran out of a café on the corner, whistling, filming and yelling at the agents. 
Across the street, more people filmed. Agents spoke to the driver of the GMC for a couple of minutes, then got back in their vehicle and left. 
Stancil is an attorney with a storied social media presence, who ran as a Democrat to represent the Uptown area in the Minnesota House in 2024. (He lost to Rep. Katie Jones.) 
He started patrolling his neighborhood in the days after Good was killed, and regularly posts the videos he records while following ICE vehicles on social media.

ICE agents have broken car windows and arrested observers, holding them for hours in the Whipple Federal Building. They’re also attempting to intimidate observers by leading them to their homes — showing that they know where the observer lives. 
Monday afternoon, apparent ICE vehicles led Stancil back to his apartment and stopped in front of it. He honked and yelled at them, but didn’t get out of the car. 
“If you’re going to arrest me for following, you may as well just do it, ‘cause I’m going to keep doing it!” Stancil yelled. The agents stayed in their cars.
U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez ruled last week that the actions of observers like Stancil are constitutionally protected: “The act of safely following (federal agents) at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,” she wrote. 
When the convoy started moving again, Stancil continued following them.

Being public about his ICE observing shows other people they can do it too, Stancil said. 
“The only way this ends in any sort of positive way is if the outside world finds out what’s happening,” he added. “And that can’t happen if we’re secretive about it.”
Unidos MN leaders invited members of the press to the Monarca “upstander” training Monday in south Minneapolis for the first time, and welcomed any “anti-constitutional extremists” — that is, right-wing activists or influencers looking for ways to “expose” the group.
“We have nothing to hide,” said Emilia Gonzáles Avalos, Unidos MN executive director, to the audience of a couple hundred. “We believe that the way that we defeat authoritarian powers is by a disciplined, committed, grounded, effort of nonviolent rigor.”
The Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party is promoting constitutional observer trainings on its website, and Democratic leaders from Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey to Gov. Tim Walz are calling on ICE to pull out of Minnesota entirely. Walz has also encouraged observers to film ICE actions to create a “database of atrocities” for future prosecution.

Rep. Kaela Berg, DFL-Burnsville, is running for Congress in Minnesota’s most competitive congressional district, the 2nd, whose current occupant U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, a Democrat, as recently as a year ago voted for a tough immigration enforcement measure called the Laken Riley Act. But Berg posted a video on X Monday blowing a whistle and honking at ICE agents.  
“We will not let them operate in silence or without witnesses,” she posted.
In a press briefing Tuesday, Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino decried “collusion and corruption between elected officials and these anarchists that are intent on creating violence for law enforcement.”
But it’s not just elected officials and anarchists. Customers at a Mexican restaurant recently sent Bovino’s agents out the door amid a hurl of profanity-laced insults. 
Local businesses take a stand, too
Signs posted on the front doors of local businesses prohibit ICE agents from the premises. 
A Minneapolis sex store has become a hub for distributing supplies to people sheltering in place. A Bar of Their Own, a Minneapolis women’s sports bar, is making whistles and handing out informational booklets. Picnic, a Linden Hills restaurant, set up a system whereby people can purchase meals for families in need; the restaurant prepares and delivers them.
ABC News interviewed a St. Paul toy store owner who has been distributing whistles and anti-ICE yard signs. Hours after the interview aired, ICE agents showed up at the store with a “notice of inspection,” forcing the store to prove its staff are permitted to work in the U.S., the Pioneer Press reported.
A general strike is planned on Friday, which organizers hope will show the strength and breadth of the anti-ICE movement in the Twin Cities. Hundreds of local businesses have already announced that they will close for the day in support of the strike, according to a list compiled by Bring Me The News.
Gonzáles Avalos of Unidos MN said this is the proudest she’s ever been to be a Minnesota. 
“For us, it doesn’t matter what side of the aisle you are on,” she said. “This movement that we’re building is about love and it’s about the powerful futures that we want to build each other.

(Photo courtesy of Park Avenue United Methodist Church.)Our church stands one short block from where a federal officer took the life of Renee Good. A few days later, the violence U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is perpetrating in our city arrived, literally, on our doorstep: Armed masked men raided our neighbors’ homes, remaining at our corner for two long hours. As we prayed and cared for those around us, several of our pastors and staff were among those who were pepper-bombed.
Our city is under siege, and when we asked the children in our congregation how they are feeling, they told us, unsurprisingly, that they feel scared. One youth, the child of an immigrant, texted his grandmother in the middle of the night: “I’m scared. Every day I live in fear and I don’t know what to do. If you’re awake please call me.”
How can we comfort our children? We feel scared too.
We can start by acknowledging that we — unlike Renee Good, unlike George Floyd — have lived to breathe another day. For one more day, we have the privilege of following the way of Jesus, who called on us to feed the hungry, clothe the naked — and welcome the stranger.
And so, in this climate of fear, we turn to that life-affirming work. Immigrant families are afraid to venture outside. We’ve had to cancel our children’s choir practice until we can confidently gather the children safely.
Yet a few children and their moms still rallied to go grocery shopping for immigrant families, delivering boxes to a local McDonald’s where many immigrants work. In distributing Happy Meals to the appreciative children, the assistant manager offered a lesson in how mutual care strengthens the bonds of community. “When you share,” he explained in his accented English, “we share.”
We wish that feeding one another during these terrible times would be enough. But our young people tell us it is not. As one of our youth said, “I want to make sure my friends are not stolen from their families.” Another child asked, “Could you make ICE disappear? They hurt people.”
Jesus understood what it meant to live under an occupying force — in his case, the Roman Empire. He understood the helplessness. He understood the stakes, and yet he persisted in showing us, before ultimately dying from the violence, that another way — a way of love — is possible.
So we will continue to deliver groceries. We will make arrangements so that, if the unfathomable happens, the children can stay with other families.
And, from the epicenter of this occupation, we send out the children’s plea: Please. Make the people who are hurting people disappear.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0722-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-21 07:57:18.929658

Doug Miller, R-Elkhart, speaks during a House committee hearing on Tuesday, Jan. 13, 2026. (Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Local officials argued Tuesday that the state shouldn’t take away their authority over housing regulations in an attempt to boost residential construction and home ownership.
The level of local control is a key part of a bill endorsed Tuesday by an Indiana House committee that targets housing affordability by limiting local zoning regulations and streamlining approvals for new residential development.
Rep. Doug Miller, the author of House Bill 1001, told the committee that a combination of “unnecessary regulations” driving up costs and insufficient new construction was resulting in too many people unable to buy homes.
Miller’s proposal would prohibit local officials from imposing requirements on exterior design elements of homes unless a city or county adopts an ordinance to opt out of the limitation.
“When we talk about design options, we’re talking about roof pitch, exterior covering materials, window and garage door placement, those types of things. Those all impact cost as we look at housing,” said Miller, R-Elkhart, who has long worked in the home building industry and is a past president of the Indiana Builders Association.
The legislation comes as various studies have found a growing housing affordability gap in the state.
Miller’s bill has the backing of Gov. Mike Braun and is a top priority for House Republicans this legislative session.
Balance of local control
Local regulations targeted by the bill also include minimum lot sizes, front and rear setbacks, height limits stricter than 60 feet and restrictions on construction of accessory dwellings, sometimes known as “in-law suites.”
Kevin Baity, the town manager for the southern Indiana community of Clarksville, told committee members that another restriction on requiring multiple parking spaces for new dwellings could increase vehicles parked on narrow streets, making travel difficult for fire trucks and sanitation vehicles.
“Dictating lower development standards should not be a decision of the state,” Baity said. “Local governments are the boots on the ground and know firsthand how their residents want their community to develop and grow. Local zoning already takes into consideration various housing options, including affordability and character.”
Rep. Blake Johnson, D-Indianapolis, raised questions about the balance between affordability and the long-term quality of construction before the House Local Government Committee voted 7-3 in favor of the bill. It now goes to the full House for action.
Impact of affordability concerns
Business organizations have cited a lack of affordable housing options as a hurdle companies face in hiring new workers.

Camille Blunt, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce’s vice president of government affairs, said the organization supports the bill as reducing unnecessary regulations and “allowing a broader mix of housing types.”
“These reforms help lower development costs, increase housing supply and improve predictability for private investment, all of which support a stronger workforce pipeline,” Blunt said. “From an employer perspective, housing policy is workforce policy. When communities can grow housing supply efficiently, businesses are better positioned to grow jobs, wages and opportunity.”
Habitat for Humanity of Indiana State Director Gina Leckron spoke in favor of the proposal, saying that some local regulations contribute to pricing some of the lower-income families the group serves out of the housing market.
“We have folks who work in warehouses, people who are managers of restaurants and other service industry jobs,” Leckron told the committee. “We believe we need to start building homes for the workforce that we have. So many people who live in your communities cannot afford a home.”

A sign beside her reads: ""We Care. We can Help"" (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).KANSAS CITY — The first slate of witnesses from the Missouri Attorney General’s office in the fight to uphold statewide abortion regulations offered testimony that professionals and scientific studies have long disputed, including claims about mental health outcomes and abortion medication. 
It’s the second week of a 10-day bench trial that will be decided by Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang. Missouri’s Planned Parenthood affiliates, along with the ACLU of Missouri, filed the lawsuit over Missouri’s few dozen Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers, or TRAP, laws, claiming they are now unconstitutional under the state’s reproductive rights amendment approved by voters in 2024.
Advocates say those laws made abortion almost completely inaccessible in the years leading up to 2022, when a near-total ban was implemented across the state. 
The state constitution now prohibits the state from denying, delaying or interfering with abortion access unless it demonstrates “a compelling governmental interest achieved by the least restrictive means.”
Abortion safety takes center stage as Missouri trial enters second week

A majority of the testimony on Tuesday focused on mental health, including two women who took the stand to talk about their own abortions more than 50 years ago. 
Linda Raymond, who grew up in St. Louis, said she had an abortion when she was 18 after pressure from her mother, who she said was embarrassed and angry that her daughter had gotten pregnant. Raymond testified that her mother beat her when she discovered she was pregnant.
The nurse and doctors at the Planned Parenthood she went to in 1976 didn’t inform her about the risks or potential complications of abortion, she said, or about the alternatives of adoption or parenting.
“If I had those things in front of me, I would have reconsidered,” Raymond said. “I would have pushed back on my mother.”
Since then, Raymond has become an anti-abortion activist, testifying that she has prayed outside of a Planned Parenthood Great Rivers clinic and tries to talk to people going inside. 
“I don’t want other women and families to make the choice that I ultimately made,” she said.
One of the laws at issue requires patients to be given a copy of Missouri’s informed consent booklet prior to an abortion — a 26-page pamphlet that begins with a statement that human life begins at conception and “abortion will terminate the life of a separate, unique, living human being.” 
It also includes information about fetal pain beginning at 16 weeks or earlier, even though the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says that a multitude of studies have established that fetuses cannot feel pain until closer to viability, around 24 weeks of pregnancy.
The law also mandates a 72-hour waiting period between an initial appointment and the procedure, when a doctor or other qualified professional must inform the patient of the “immediate and long-term medical risks to her and possible adverse psychological effects associated with the abortion.” 
Attorneys for the state have previously emphasized the need for a “reflection period” for women before they move forward with an abortion. Those who testified for Planned Parenthood last week said it put a huge burden on patients, especially those who had to take time off work, arrange child care or travel long distances to get to the clinic. 
Having a wanted abortion isn’t linked to mental health issues, but being denied a wanted abortion is, according to the American Psychological Institute. Dr. Daniel Grossman, who was called to testify last week by Planned Parenthood’s attorneys, told the court he regularly reviews literature on abortion and mental health and hasn’t seen any evidence of abortion increasing the risk of mental health problems.
But more recent studies, like the Turnaway Study, paint a better reality, he said. That study, led by one of Grossman’s colleagues at University of California San Francisco, where he serves as ​​director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, focused on 1,000 women who sought abortions between 2008 and 2010 years, and then followed them for five years after they either received an abortion or were unable to get one, including because of state laws banning or limiting abortion.
This study, Grossman testified, found anxiety rates were higher among women who had just been denied abortions. But after five years, he said, there was no difference in the mental health of the groups who had abortions versus those turned away. Grossman is also a liaison to Planned Parenthood’s National Medical Committee.
According to Missouri public records, post-abortion complication reports from 2018 to 2022 show no patients with a diagnosable psychiatric condition listed as a complication.
Stephanie Jacobson, who was a Missouri resident until about four years ago, had an abortion when she was 16 in 1978, and another when she was 18. Jacobson went on to have five children, but testified Tuesday that the abortions “ravaged” her and left her with depression and anxiety that lingered until she went through an abortion recovery program less than a decade ago.
Now Jacobson is a coach for an abortion recovery hotline, though she said that has exacerbated her mental health issues. 
During her testimony, she recounted one “intense” call from a woman who was panicked and screaming after having a medication abortion at home. Jacobson said while she was trying to talk the woman through what she could do with the fetal remains that were sitting on a cloth on the counter, the woman said her cat started eating them.
Attorneys for the plaintiff immediately objected to Jacobson’s testimony as hearsay, and Zhang agreed to strike it from the record. However, the state opted to bring Jacobson back to the stand later in the afternoon to tell the same story again with more detail “on proffer,” which means it won’t be considered as evidence in this trial but could be considered on appeal.
The state also called Dr. Monique Wubbenhorst, who practiced as an OBGYN for more than 30 years but has never performed an abortion and is against abortion in all circumstances except to save the pregnant patient’s life. Her testimony included many of the same arguments that were already discussed in the first week of the trial, such as the safety of medication abortion.
Wubbenhorst’s testimony will conclude Wednesday morning, and the trial is expected to end on Monday.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8174-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-21 06:58:18.128336

Chanting demonstrators blocked traffic before gathering in front of the ICE building to demand an end to the federal agency’s presence in Vermont.
Speakers repeatedly condemned ICE’s immigration raids across the country, particularly the recent killing of Renee Good in Minnesota. After hearing calls to participate in a general strike this Friday, protesters marched along Harvest Lane.

Shannon Zimmerman said about his data center regulation bill. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Assembly passed a Republican bill Tuesday to implement state regulations on data centers being built in Wisconsin. Democratic lawmakers said the measure wouldn’t effectively hold companies accountable, hold down electric rates for Wisconsinites or protect the environment.
Data center development is booming in Wisconsin. Microsoft this week proposed adding 15 data centers to a project in Mount Pleasant. Some projects in development has triggered pushback from area residents. According to datacentermap.com, there are at least 40 data centers currently in the state and more in development. Local governments, including in Madison, where the city council became the first in the state to pass a one-year moratorium on approvals for data center projects, are considering their roles in regulating or pushing forward projects. 
AB 840, coauthored by Rep. Shannon Zimmerman (R-River Falls) and Sen. Romaine Quinn (R-Birchwood), establishing regulations of data centers, passed 53-44. Rep. Joy Goeben (R-Hobart) joined Democrats voting against the bill, while Rep. Steve Doyle and Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) voted with Republicans in favor of the bill.
“This bill balances the strategic and economic benefits of AI and data centers to the state while balancing concerns that ratepayers may have over energy, and that some may have over environmental implications,” Zimmerman said at a press conference ahead of the floor session.
Democratic lawmakers were critical of the bill, saying it doesn’t go far enough to protect Wisconsinites. 
“We need to take action to regulate data centers, but we need to get it right. Unfortunately, the GOP bill that we’re voting on today will not do what it promises,” Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) told reporters ahead of the floor session, adding that the bill process was “rushed.” The GOP bill was introduced on Jan. 9, and received a public hearing on Jan. 14. 
“It will not hold corporations accountable in the way that we should, and it doesn’t protect our communities entirely from the higher energy costs that are being discussed,” Neubauer said.  She asserted that Republican lawmakers “don’t actually want to regulate data centers or large corporations.” 
Zimmerman said the bill is responsive to concerns from constituents.
“Hands down the concerns are concern over ratepayer protection, concern over water, concern over land, and protection of those sort of things,” Zimmerman said. “This bill is not coming from left field… This is something we’ve been talking about.”  
Whether the bill becomes law is up in the air. It must pass the Senate and be signed by Gov. Tony Evers, who has expressed some skepticism about it.
According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Evers’ spokesperson Britt Cudaback said on Jan. 14 that “the one thing environmentalists, labor, utilities, and data center companies can all agree on right now is how bad Republican lawmakers’ data center bill is.” 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said he didn’t know why Evers “would ever consider vetoing this bill, especially considering the fact that it is really based on what the citizens have said.” 
“I don’t think being on the side of not wanting data center regulation is anywhere near the middle, so we have been very thoughtful in what we put forward,” Vos said. 
The Republican bill includes a number of requirements including having the Public Service Commission (PSC) ensure that no costs related to construction of electric infrastructure for data centers are allocated to other customers and requiring that any renewable energy facilities that are primarily serving a data center must be located within the data center site. Democratic lawmakers said the requirement would stifle the development of renewable energy in Wisconsin and expansion of the state’s energy portfolio. 
“Their limits on renewable energy would come at a significant cost to consumers and are clearly a continuation of the GOP’s ongoing allegiance with the fossil fuel industry,” Neubauer said. 
“Their limits on renewable energy would come at a significant cost to consumers and are clearly a continuation of the GOP’s ongoing allegiance with the fossil fuel industry,” Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) said. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner).
Zimmerman said, however, that requiring renewable sources on site would ensure that a local community is benefiting from jobs that are created. 
Under the bill, water used for cooling purposes in a data center is required to be contained in a “closed-loop cooling system,” or “or any other system that uses an amount of water equal to or less than the amount that a closed-loop cooling system would use.” A closed-loop cooling system uses a fixed amount of water to keep data centers cool.
An amendment to the bill states that the requirements will only apply to large data centers that begin operating or undergo construction after the bill takes effect.
Data center operators also will be required to submit annual reports to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) on the total amount of water used in a year. An amendment to the bill also says that data center developers should as much as possible encourage hiring of Wisconsin residents. 
“This bill is not a reaction to any of those data centers acting in various ways. This is just smart legislation to make sure we have the rules of the road going forward,” Zimmerman said. 
The bill also says no one can  operate a large data center unless they file a bond in an amount sufficient to cover the estimated cost of fulfilling any required reclamation with the DNR.
An amendment to the bill also clarifies that if the permit granted for the construction of a large data center expires before the center is finished, then the owner must notify the DNR and local government. It requires that if it isn’t finished by the date then the owner must work to restore the land as much as possible. 
Zimmerman said the provision gives flexibility to local governments for recourse in the case  a project is abandoned. 
According to the Wisconsin Lobbying website, the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation and the Associated Builders and Contractors of Wisconsin Inc. registered in favor of the bill. There are several more groups registered against the bill, including Wisconsin Conservation Voters and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Construction Electrician Local Unions. 
Democratic lawmakers, led by Rep. Angela Stroud (D-Ashland) and Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay), have proposed their own legislation to regulate data centers. That bill, AB 722, would place data centers in their own class of “very large customers” to ensure that everyday ratepayers don’t bear the costs of data centers’ energy demands. It would also take steps to regulate data centers and encourage renewable energy use. Lawmakers introduced the bill as an amendment during the floor session, but Republican lawmakers voted it down.
Stroud said the GOP bill is a “concept of an idea.” 
“There’s nothing in the bill that the PSC could actually implement to do the job it says it’s going to do,” Stroud said. 
Stroud said her proposal, while “not perfect,” would “get us as close as possible to the central goal of protecting the public by controlling costs, creating transparency and making sure that we’re keeping as much value in our communities as possible.”
Under the Democratic bill, data center companies would be required to pay an annual fee to the Department of Administration (DOA); revenue which would go towards renewable energy programs. It would also have companies submit quarterly reports to the PSC on the amount of energy being used by data centers as well as information on the source of the energy. Water utilities would also need to publicly report when a single customer will account for more than 25% of the total water usage in the district. 
The bill would require that companies pay workers at construction sites the prevailing wage rate or if the employee is a union member, then the rate in the worker’s collective bargaining agreement — whichever rate is higher. It also says that to qualify for sales tax exemptions available to data centers under current law, companies would need to meet labor requirements and source 70% of their energy from renewable sources.
Vos said that the Democratic bill will “have very little impact on the average person unless you’re a union activist or someone who wants renewable energy everywhere.”

That combination creates a threshold integrity problem Missouri has not yet confronted: if the state is going to pay for “outcomes,” it must first secure the measurement layer that produces those outcomes on paper. Otherwise, Missouri risks rewarding the best metric managers, not the best educators—and funding “success” the public cannot audit.
In finance, you don’t build a compensation system on numbers that can be altered off-ledger. You lock the measurement layer first. The same logic applies here.
 The grade is the unit of account

A transcript is not just a student document. It is the state’s academic currency—the unit of account behind credits, completions, licensure pathways, transfer decisions, scholarship eligibility, employer trust, and the performance metrics Missouri uses to allocate money.
If Missouri’s funding incentives increasingly depend on institutional performance measures, then Missouri must guarantee the integrity of the inputs. And a final grade is a primary input.
 Why this is a Missouri problem now

Missouri’s own Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development performance funding model says it is used to allocate the majority of higher-education funding increases based on performance measures. Policymakers are also exploring broader formulas; the Missouri Independent reported on a House committee effort to enact a statewide performance-funding approach (Missouri Independent brief).
That momentum is unfolding while higher education enters a demographic squeeze. WICHE projects the number of U.S. high school graduates peaks around 2025 and then declines for years—pressure that intensifies institutional dependence on enrollment and retention (WICHE). When money tracks metrics, and metrics track survival, the temptation to treat measurements as targets rises.
There is also a structural shift: governance increasingly lives inside software permissions. In a modern SIS/LMS environment, “authority” is often a back-end access privilege—who can approve, who can override, who can finalize. If grade changes can be made off-screen, the state’s performance dollars become vulnerable to “outcome management.”
If Missouri intensifies performance funding without first locking down transcript integrity, it will accidentally subsidize what it should never pay for: strategic manipulation of academic outcomes.
 ‘Grades can be changed’ is not the same as ‘grades can be edited’

Every institution needs a grade-appeal process. Clerical errors happen. Incompletes convert to final grades. Accommodations must be honored. Formal appeals require adjudication. Those are legitimate governance functions.
But the policy question is different: can a grade be revised by administrative action outside a formal appeal—without a transparent audit trail showing who changed it, when, under what written authority, for what documented reason, what evidence supported the change, and whether the faculty of record agreed (and if not, what due process occurred)?
If Missouri allows “editable grades” at scale — especially through back-end software permissions — it creates a moral hazard. Institutions under enrollment and budget stress will feel pressure to “solve” retention problems by quietly repairing the numbers. That is credential inflation: painless at first, punishing later.
And inflation is never “neutral.” When transcripts are discounted, the strongest students—often first-generation and lower-income students who depend on a trusted signal—are the first to lose bargaining power with employers and graduate programs.
 Student consumer protection depends on grade integrity

Students purchase higher education on a promise: the credential reflects real learning evaluated under known standards. Employers rely on that signal. Taxpayers rely on it when the state pays for “success.”
This is consumer protection:
• Students deserve the market value of the credential they earn.
• Employers deserve reliable signals.
• Taxpayers deserve outcomes that were not engineered.
Education records exist to document academic decisions—not to serve as customer-service instruments. The U.S. Department of Education’s Student Privacy Policy Office explains FERPA’s framework and record-amendment limits (Student Privacy / FERPA). Missouri should treat that principle as baseline policy: if a record changes, the change must be rare, transparent, reviewable, and documented.
 Accreditation and Title IV risk: integrity is a compliance standard

Missouri institutions operate under accreditor standards and federal Title IV conditions. For much of Missouri, the relevant institutional accreditor is the Higher Learning Commission, whose Criteria for Accreditation emphasize integrity, stated policies, and consistent application. Grade governance becomes a compliance risk when procedures are undisclosed, inconsistent, or overridden without due process and documentation.
Federal rules also prohibit institutional misrepresentation, including misleading claims about the nature of an educational program or outcomes (34 CFR 668, Subpart F). If an institution represents that grades reflect faculty evaluation but undisclosed back-end alteration is tolerated, Missouri is financing a credibility risk that lands on students and employers, not administrators.
A Missouri-solvable fix: a Transcript Integrity/Grade Audit Trail Act
Missouri does not need to micromanage campuses. It needs statutory guardrails that align incentives with integrity.
1) Faculty-of-record primacy
The final course grade belongs to the faculty of record. Any post-submission change must either (a) be initiated by the faculty of record, or (b) occur through a formal, documented appeal process with written findings.
2) Narrow, standardized exception categories
Define a finite set of allowable reasons for changes (clerical error, incomplete resolved, documented accommodation, formal appeal outcome, etc.) and prohibit ad-hoc “customer service” adjustments.
3) Tamper-evident audit trail for every change
Every post-submission change must preserve and log: original grade and revised grade; date/time; identity/role; cited policy authority; written justification and supporting documentation; and notification to the faculty of record (with an opportunity to respond where applicable).
4) Aggregate transparency reporting
Publish annual, aggregate counts of post-term grade changes by reason code (no student identifiers), and certify that state performance metrics are derived from records that comply with the audit rules.
5) Funding consequence for noncompliance
If Missouri is going to pay for outcomes, it should not pay for unauditable outcomes. Institutions that cannot certify controls should not receive performance-funding increases until they can.
This is not punitive. It is normal internal control—exactly what any serious performance system requires.
 The choice: pay for learning, or pay for numbers

Missouri’s performance funding ambitions are not illegitimate. Taxpayers can reasonably demand results. But it is reckless to scale performance incentives atop an academic record system that permits untraceable edits to the measurement layer.
If Missouri wants performance funding, it must first guarantee performance integrity. That starts with one principle, put into law and enforced as a condition of outcome-based dollars: the grade belongs to the faculty—and any change must leave fingerprints.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy signed more than a hundred bills before he left office Tuesday, including legislation to bar restaurants from providing disposable cutlery to customers unless asked.
The new law prohibits full-service New Jersey restaurants from providing single-use utensils to dine-in customers, and all restaurants can only provide disposable knives, forks, and spoons to customers who request them or through self-serve dispensers.
The same restrictions apply to single-use condiments like ketchup packets, though the bill permits the use of disposable paper serving cups used for self-service purposes at certain eateries.
Gov. Murphy vetoes immigrant protection bills, angering activists

School cafeterias, health care facilities, and correctional institutions are exempt from the bill’s restrictions. The bill takes effect Aug. 1. It’ll take effect two years later for food courts.
Murphy, a Democrat, left office after two terms as governor. His successor, Gov. Mikie Sherrill (D), became governor at noon.
Other legislation signed by Murphy in his final hours in office approved $128 million in new spending that was lambasted by Republicans in the Legislature. The bill includes $20 million to the FIFA World Cup host committee for promotions (Murphy’s wife chairs the committee’s board of directors), $25 million for a state supercomputer, and millions for projects in Democratic-run counties.
A separate bill Murphy signed will boost penalties for cyberharassment of public servants — including, among others, elected officials, jurors, and judges — or their families.
The governor’s signature boosted the maximum prison term for cyberharassment against a public servant to between one and five years, from the 18 months allowed under New Jersey’s existing harassment law.
To be guilty of cyberharassment, a person must threaten physical harm to another or their property, commit a crime against them, or post obscene material about another person with the intent to cause them emotional distress.
Murphy also signed a bill to create a specialized unit within the Department of Corrections to investigate sexual misconduct in New Jersey correctional facilities.
That legislation creates a women’s services division within the Department of Corrections and a separate board of trustees to oversee the state’s women’s prisons and mandates the prisons provide certain services, like doulas to pregnant women serving jail terms, for example.
The bill also requires additional training for correctional officers, including on their responsibilities under the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act.
New Jersey’s Department of Health will be permitted to launch a pilot program studying the effects of psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in hallucinogenic mushrooms, under a separate bill Murphy signed.
The bill appropriates $6 million for studies at three New Jersey hospitals — one each in the state’s northern, central, and southern regions — to measure the chemical’s effect on mental health and substance use disorders.
The Department of Health must submit a report detailing its findings and recommendations for the potential medical use of psilocybin.
The bill does not legalize or decriminalize psilocybin.

(Photo by Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Ahead of the 2026 legislative session, Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s office told state government agencies to work with the governor’s office before responding to questions from state lawmakers and journalists.
The same day as Little delivered his State of the State address that unveiled plans to cut state government spending to avoid a budget shortfall, the governor’s Chief of Staff Zach Hauge released a memo to state agency directors.
“Agencies must respond to all requests for information in the Legislature in a timely manner,” Hauge wrote in the Jan. 12 memo, according to a copy that the Idaho Capital Sun obtained in a public records request. “Inform your Governor’s Office contact and (Division of Financial Management) analyst immediately following the request.”
In a statement Tuesday, Little’s Communications Director Emily Callihan said the policy requires agencies to coordinate with the governor’s office before responding to legislators’ requests, and that it applies even when the Legislature is not in session. The practice was in place in Idaho before Little became the governor in 2019, and it is common in other states, she added.

“As head of the executive branch, Governor Little works closely with state agencies on policy, budgeting, operations, and communications to best serve Idahoans,” Callihan said in response to questions about the policy on replying to journalists’ questions. “Coordination between the Governor’s Office and agencies — including on responses to certain media inquiries — is a common practice among governors’ offices nationwide and predates Governor Little’s administration. This coordination also helps ensure the administration is aware of issues generating public interest across agencies.”
 Governor tells agencies how to testify to Legislature’s budget committee

The memo also outlined other coordination with the governor’s office related to the legislative session and the state’s budgeting process, such as: 

To testify on bills not related to executive agency legislation — which has already been vetted by the governor’s office — prior approval from the governor’s office “is required.”
At hearings of the Legislature’s budget-writing committee, called the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC for short, agencies “must support the Governor’s Executive Budget recommendations.” For line items recommended by the governor, agencies “should provide JFAC with further explanation and justification.” For line items not in the governor’s budget, “the agency should simply respond ‘no’ if asked for comments beyond the (Legislative Services Office) analyst introduction.”

“Idaho’s economy is strong and we will continue to thrive, but balancing our budget is more challenging now than what we have experienced in recent years. It is imperative that we work together to preserve the investments we have made without relying on draining reserve accounts or adopting large tax hikes like our neighboring states,” Hauge wrote. “For this agenda to be successful, frequent contact with your Governor’s office liaison is critical.”

 Governor’s office stressed coordination ‘before’ replying to journalists

The governor’s office’s memo also stressed that agencies should collaborate with the governor’s office before replying to journalists’ questions that are related to the agency’s budget or legislative bills.

“If you or your staff receive requests from the news media for information or comment on anything related to your budget or legislation impacting your agency, please coordinate with the Governor’s office before responding,” Hauge wrote, underlining and italicizing the word before. “We understand this may not be possible if a reporter confronts you in the Capitol building.”
His memo directed agency heads to coordinate with staff in the governor’s office “to discuss the question before responding.” 
Callihan said in a statement that the practice on media communications has also been happening before Little took office, and that it “occurs year-round, not only during the legislative session.” 
 Former Idaho Gov. Butch Otter required state agencies to share ‘ALL media inquiries’ 

In 2008, Little’s predecessor then-Idaho Gov. Butch Otter’s office told state agencies that they “must inform his office of ‘ALL media inquiries,’” the Spokesman-Review reported at the time. 
Little’s office did not agree to an interview, but sent statements in response to written questions from the Idaho Capital Sun.
The governor’s office’s memo last week, Callihan added, “is a routine communication sent to agency directors at the start of each legislative session, a practice that was in place before Governor Little took office.”

The path to landing what’s been described as “the Disney World of gas stations” was paved Tuesday night when the Gretna City Council gave initial approval to a request to annex about 43 acres southeast of Interstate 80 and Highway 31.

Testimony during the meeting confirmed that a 74,000-square-foot Buc-ee’s store with 100 gas pumps would be built upon that tract, if all goes as planned. To access incentive benefits associated with a state-designated good life district, the project must also be within the city limits. 
“We are thrilled,” said Evans, calling the project a major economic development milestone for the state, as well as Gretna and its good life district, which must meet certain growth benchmarks to continue to reap the state incentive associated with the designation.
“Buc-ee’s checks all the boxes the good life legislation was designed for — it generates significant tax revenue, increases our state’s tourism and creates hundreds of good paying local jobs,” Evans said.
 Cheers and applause 

Tom Heines, who owns the annexed land where Buc-ee’s would go, declined to comment, telling the Examiner he was bound by a nondisclosure agreement. But Evans said his team has been working with Buc-ee’s and on the deal since last summer, and that the property is under contract. 
He said the city is excited to wrap up. Still ahead are two more rounds of City Council approval for the annexation, which would become effective in March.
An economic development advisory committee also must approve a package that will contribute good life district funds to the development cost, said Evans. 











Buc-ee's checks all the boxes the good life legislation was designed for — it generates significant tax revenue, increases our state’s tourism and creates hundreds of good paying local jobs.


– Mike Evans, mayor of Gretna



	As designed, the good life law originally approved in 2023 and twice refined created a major incentive: State sales taxes imposed within the districts are to be cut in half, from 5.5% to 2.75%. The idea is to recapture the difference to help finance unique entertainment and shopping districts that over time would draw more tourism to the state.
Evans predicts that a Buc-ee’s would draw travelers and others who then would shop elsewhere in the area. 
John Chamberlain, a project engineer representing Texas-based Buc-ee’s, did not identify the retailer at first but did so Tuesday night upon questioning from Gretna officials. His answer drew applause and shouts of approval from several audience members. One woman asked if Chamberlain had brought any “merch.”

“I know they’re kind of a hot item right now,” Evans, with a chuckle, said of Buc-ee’s.
“That’s a lot of brisket,” another official said when Chamberlain mentioned the store’s dimensions.
He said the Gretna Buc-ee’s would offer the typical huge variety of snacks, souvenirs and other features. The chain strives for a destination-like experience that some say attracts cult-like followings.
At a Buc-ee’s opening of a location last year in Georgia, a U.S. congressman called  it the Disney World of gas stations. 
 Boost to ‘good life district’

Evans expects a Buc-ee’s to boost Gretna’s good life district, one of five areas across the state that have been designated as such. The intent was to foster “transformational” economic developments that in the long run would be a boon to the state in the form of increased sales tax revenue.
Concerns arose, including whether developers would get too much and the state would not reap a fair return on its investment. Among the controversy was how more than $2.2 million in state sales tax revenue was lost as progress on the 2,000-acre Gretna district was stymied. 
Businessman Rod Yates — whose application created the Gretna good life district to include and surround his Nebraska Crossing mall centered at I-80 and Highway 31 — could not come to agreeable financial terms with the city on his mega youth-sports centric campus. He eventually changed directions. 
The City of Gretna is overseeing the district and ensuring that proposals within the district meet state guidelines.
Evans hopes Yates will still try and develop his vision, or at least a part of it. He would be treated like any other developer that would submit a proposal to the economic development advisory committee for review, Evans said. The City Council has final approval, he said.
Evans called the Buc-ee’s project an example “of what’s possible” in the good life district.
“It shows that when we compete and have the right tools, we can do some pretty cool stuff in this state.”

Senate Bill 78, authored by Sen. Jeff Raatz, R-Richmond, passed the chamber 28-19 after a 40-minute floor debate.
Eight Democrats and 11 Republicans voted against the measure. GOP votes in opposition were cast by Sens. Ron Alting of Lafayette, Eric Bassler of Washington, Vaneta Becker of Evansville, Justin Busch of Fort Wayne, Dan Dernulc of Highland, Aaron Freeman of Indianapolis, Jean Leising of Oldenburg, Ryan Mishler of Mishawaka, Jim Tomes of Wadesville, Kyle Walker of Lawrence and Greg Walker of Columbus.

The legislation would require all public schools to adopt a ban that prohibits students from using or possessing a wireless communication device during the school day and requires that any teacher-directed use of a device “for educational purposes” occur only on school-supplied devices.
It also mandates that each district choose between two enforcement models: a “no device policy,” in which students may not bring phones to school at all; or a “secure storage policy,” in which students may bring phones but must store them so they are “inaccessible throughout the school day.”
The bill expands the definition of “wireless communication device” to include smartwatches connected to a phone, cell tower or the Internet.
Under current state law, students are prohibited from using phones during instructional time, but they can use them during lunch and passing periods.
‘Adults need to be in charge’
Raatz said the bill is driven by mounting evidence in favor of phone-free schools. 
“It’s proven statistically that kids need a distraction-free day in school,” he said. “Adults need to be in charge. Students need to listen.”
Raatz further told senators his bill intentionally leaves some policy decisions to local schools, but he acknowledged that four key issues will still need to be resolved in the opposing chamber.
‘Away for the day’: Indiana lawmakers take up bill expanding cellphone ban to entire school day

He cited elementary school storage options; exceptions for student access to phones for work-based learning opportunities and athletics; hashing out specifics for smart watch connectivity; and dealing with policy implications on school-sponsored devices.
Democrats and some Republicans who spoke against the bill on Tuesday argued that while limiting distractions in the classroom can improve student learning, the bill creates practical and safety concerns as well as costs for schools.
Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, said research supports reducing distractions but was opposed to advancing a bill with unresolved problems. 
“Rather than fixing these issues on the House side, I always prefer that we get the job done here,” Qaddoura said, adding that storage costs and enforcement would be burdensome for large Hoosier schools. “Teachers are supportive of the idea of limiting the cellphones in the classroom … but the implementation is the problem.”
Sen. La Keisha Jackson, D-Indianapolis, also opposed the bill, pointing to school shootings and emergencies. 
“If you have not been in that situation,” she said, “you do not know what it feels like to be helpless without a cellphone or some type of contact to contact somebody.”
Division within the Senate GOP supermajority
Leising, among the objecting GOP senators, questioned why lawmakers were expanding restrictions instead of enforcing existing law. 


The Indiana Senate also voted 38-9 to ban ranked choice voting even though it isn’t used in Indiana. Sen. Blake Doriot, R-Syracuse, called it confusing and cited problems in other states that use the option.
Most elections use a single choice model. In a ranked choice version, voters rank the candidates in order of preference. If no candidate wins a majority of ballots on which they are listed as the top choice, the other rankings are used to determine a winner.
The vote was party-line with Republicans supporting the ban and Democrats against.


“I wish that rather than having this bill, we would be addressing how we can fix what we already have in place,” Leising said.
Additionally, Sen. Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, pressed Raatz on enforcement and flexibility, calling the bill “government overreach and an unfunded mandate.” She argued, too, that the policy “has no teeth.”
“If schools are having issues with the current policy we passed … let’s help them,” Yoder said, warning that expanding the mandate without clear enforcement or funding would not solve those problems.
Raatz countered that schools already enforce behavioral rules daily and should not be micromanaged by lawmakers. 
“We should not legislate all the way down,” he said. “The bottom line is, the school does it every day and kids — yes, they learn their behavior.”
“They learn because of the restrictions that are set in place,” Raatz continued. “You can’t have (the device) — and if you have it, you’re going to get in trouble.”
Byrne, a Republican who supported the bill, reiterated that the policy would improve student outcomes at no cost to the state.
“The locals,” he added, “will be able to figure it out.”
The Senate vote came the same day a national coalition of child well-being groups released a report grading Indiana a “C” for its current phone-free school policy, citing the state’s limitation of restrictions to instructional time rather than the entire school day.
The report found that states with “bell-to-bell” phone bans — requiring students to store devices in secure, inaccessible locations for the full school day — are more likely to see improvements in academic performance, student mental health and teacher satisfaction.

Federal report stressed concerns over deteriorating USFS recreational amenities. Retired Wyoming staffers who spent last season volunteering on the forest expect it to only get worse. 
The post Backlogged and DOGE-depleted: Forest Service report raises alarm over trail health appeared first on WyoFile .","Careers in public education — as a teacher and a school counselor, respectively — offered longtime Lander residents Del Nelson and Bill Lee summertime freedom.
Another thing they had in common was love for the rugged mountains. That inspired each man to sign up for seasonal U.S. Forest Service posts and disappear into the mountains every summer. It also contributed to a decades-long friendship.
Mostly, the men worked on the rugged 2.5-million-acre Shoshone National Forest, which stretches from the Montana border to the edge of the Red Desert in Western Wyoming. They worked as rangers, forestry technicians, campground hosts and fire crew. Over the decades they built bridges, cleared trees, drove fire engines, cleaned up after messy campers and repaired infrastructure. 
“I would say my job was ‘T to T,’ tickets to toilets,” Nelson said. 
“We had the best job, Del and I,” Lee added. “It was good times.”
Even after retiring from education, Nelson and Lee both continued to work seasonal forest gigs, amassing 90 years between them. But after Lee retired from his seasonal recreation work in 2024, the agency cut his position. Then it eliminated Nelson’s, Lee said, citing lack of funding.

This was before President Donald Trump and Elon Musk launched the Department of Government Efficiency in 2025 to vastly reduce government spending. 
“And then DOGE came in and just did a hatchet job, and we have not recovered, and nor does it look like we’re going to recover anytime in the near future,” Lee said.
In Wyoming, where nearly 50% of the land is managed by the federal government for public use and enjoyment, the layoffs, cuts and policy changes deeply impacted the U.S. Forest Service district offices. 
Now, an internal federal report, which surfaced in December, reveals dire warnings from Forest Service personnel about the future of the agency’s recreation amenities unless issues like critical vacancies, depleted staff, unfunded contracts and chaotic communication are addressed. The Trails Program Status Report described districts that lost up to 100% of their trail staff, including decades of trail expertise, and are now suffering widespread burnout. 
“Public access, visitor satisfaction, and recreation-based economic contributions will continue to decline in 2026 and beyond without direction to prioritize investments in recreation generally and the trails program specifically,” the report reads. “This would include action in hiring, clearer communication, and improvements around grants and agreement management. Without this support, the agency risks losing decades of investment in trail infrastructure.”
Wyoming agency staffers have declined to speak on record about DOGE since Trump took office. Lee and Nelson, however, have no qualms or restrictions. After both men spent the 2025 field season volunteering on the Shoshone National Forest, repairing signs, fixing picnic tables and observing eroded trail sections, they say the concerns underscored in the report are valid and critical.  
“We made it through this last year, but it’s not sustainable,” Lee said. “Stuff is going to build up.”

What Lee observes is insufficient staffing and resources to tackle the amount of work necessary to steward and maintain the resource. 
Most concerning, Lee said, “is the lack of seasonal people that do the work on the ground. They’ve been wiped out.”
That leaves permanent specialists without the crews to implement their programs and all but guarantees backlogs build up. “As far as maintenance, it just isn’t getting done because there’s not enough people,” Lee said. 
‘It ain’t feasible’
It has been difficult to identify how many jobs DOGE impacted in Wyoming’s public land management agencies. Federal agencies have declined to share that information. Anecdotal reports, however, indicate several district offices in Wyoming’s eight national forests were hardest hit. 
In February, job cuts gutted the Shoshone National Forest’s Washakie District office in Lander. The office closed temporarily to the public, citing insufficient staff to remain open. 
Lee followed the upheaval in his local district office with great concern, stopping by regularly to check in. While talking with an employee last spring about a trails crew that had diminished in the recent past from nearly a dozen to two, he said, the cuts’ implications really started to dawn on him.  
“I said, ‘I wonder what a year is going to be like with two people in recreation for [the Dubois and Lander area] to get the job done?’” Lee recalled. “And I said, ‘it ain’t feasible.’”

So he volunteered to help with general maintenance or smaller tasks. Nelson, meanwhile, volunteered as a campground host, a job that would also see him doing repairs on the forest. Barb Gustin, another retired staffer, volunteered to man the Lander office’s vacant front desk through the busy summer months. 
Lee was torn, he said, by the thought that, “if I do too much, then [critics] are gonna say we don’t need the position.” But in the end, his concern for the land prevailed. He spent many days working alongside Nelson. The men repaired docks, secured loose signs, cleaned bathrooms and educated campers about fire rules. 
They worked mainly in the frontcountry, and what they witnessed made them worried not only about the campgrounds and parking lots, but also the roughly 1,300 miles of trails in the forest. Without sufficient trails crews, they said, the district lacks the manpower to clear trees, fix water bars, watch for erosion and steward the paths. If the trend continues, it only becomes harder to turn it around. 
Much of their sentiment was mirrored in the December Washington Office Trails Program report, which the Washington Post first published. 
Compiled by asking nearly 300 district-level staff to assess trails operations challenges, the report listed critical vacancies, seasonal hiring restrictions, staff reassignments and lost skills that are “weakening the agency’s ability to implement technical projects and oversee partner, volunteer, and contractor work, which is leading to unpassable trails, unsafe bridges, and negative environmental impacts.”
Positions critical to keeping wilderness trails open are vacant, the report says, and unclear communication and inconsistent messaging coming from higher-ups is eroding morale. Backcountry trails are being neglected, deferred maintenance is compounding. In addition, “millions of dollars of unspent grant funds have been returned due to key vacancies, no temporary workforce, and lengthy or stalled agreement processes.” 
The number of miles maintained was down 22%, according to the report, with just 19% designated as meeting standard. That marks the “lowest accomplishments in 15 years.”

The report also included quotes from agency personnel portraying deflated skeleton crews with impossible workloads. 
“I have never lacked for motivation for trail work until now,” reads one. “It feels like we are on the verge of not passing anything on for the future, and that feels like 24 years of trails and wilderness work rolling back to the bottom of the hill.”
In a Jan. 16 post, Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz struck a more positive tone. While the agency becomes leaner, Schultz’s aim is to refocus on “fundamental work that delivers the greatest good to the American people.”
That includes cutting red tape, managing more productive forests and ensuring outdoor access, he wrote online. 
“Expanding that access and improving visitor experience is a major priority,” he wrote. “We’re modernizing trails, campgrounds, and facilities; improving roads and recreation sites; strengthening on-the-ground engagement; and using tools like Recreation.gov to help visitors plan safe, enjoyable trips.”
Disconnects
Schultz’s message is at odds with what Lee sees in the forest and hears from staffers.
One Wyoming Forest Service employee, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their job, said their work life has been dominated by uncertainty and fear as Washington communications have become unclear, inconsistent, politicized or absent. The employee, a natural resource specialist, has seen their own team reduced dramatically, and notes it’s much more than recreation being affected. The Forest Service also oversees grazing management, post-fire recovery, watershed and habitat protection, cultural resource stewardship, and a wide range of restoration.
“It’s not just recreation,” they said. “All Forest Service staff are suffering.”
Employees are being asked to do work not in their contracts as well as accomplish their normal workload with severely diminished resources, the employee said. In addition, a string of out-of-left-field directives and disruptions has raised stress to unacceptable levels as staffers fear for their jobs. 
“It’s just exhausting, it’s not sustainable and there’s no end site,” the employee said. “I think everybody’s just kind of hanging in there because we really care deeply about our work as public servants and the mission of the Forest Service. But it’s also devastating on a daily basis.”
Nelson sees another disconnect. It used to be that the majority of agency staff, regardless of their title, had hands-on experience on a forest. That no longer seems to be the case, he said. Agency brass, he added, increasingly don’t seem to recognize the value of “just being up there” — spending time on and developing intimate knowledge of the land and water by sleeping under the stars, watching wildlife and enjoying the peace.

Both men have ample experience of that value — be it on the Shoshone National Forest or elsewhere. They have watched family and strangers fundamentally changed by public lands experiences. Nelson himself recalls returning to the classroom each fall refreshed from a summer spent outside.
For Lee, being outdoors is humbling and majestic, the value “priceless.”
“To me it’s spiritual,” he said. “It’s good for the soul. It’s good for the heart.”
Recommendations 
Nelson first worked for the agency in 1970; Lee in 1979. Over the decades, the men witnessed many changes. Rutted dirt roads were paved, trails were built and uses like ATVs, mountain bikes and climbing became more prominent. The nature of users expanded and evolved with social media and widespread promotion. Camping trailers became wildly popular.
One thing that was constant, Lee said, is Wyoming residents’ love for public lands. “They are important to all of us,” he said. Now, he feels they are in danger.

The December internal report included recommendations, such as expediting temporary seasonal hiring, allowing for extensions of certain permanent seasonal positions, increasing capacity for supporting partnerships and providing “accurate, consistent messaging from leadership to all levels of the agency.” 
Hiring temporary seasonal staff is an urgent need, Lee said. While volunteer labor is helpful, he said, it’s not as efficient or effective as paid staff. 
As for Lee and Nelson? Lee plans to volunteer again — and to continue speaking for the agency’s needs as others clam up for fear of reprisals. “It’s my way of pushing back against what I think is really wrong and tragic,” he said.
Nelson, meanwhile, isn’t so sure. 
“I don’t know,” the 81-year-old said on a recent afternoon. “I may, if something needed to be done…”
At that, Lee piped up immediately. 
“You know, we gotta fix the dock!” he said, referring to a structure at Louise Lake. “That table’s busted. We’ve got to fix it!”

In split vote, Game and Fish commissioners decide to allow hunters over age 18 to earn certificates solely through online coursework — an option already available via out-of-state classes. 
The post Wyoming ends in-person hunter safety requirement despite instructor concerns appeared first on WyoFile .","Fremont County resident and hunter safety instructor Joanne Eisemann wants Wyoming to keep requiring in-person coursework for novice hunters as a matter of public safety. 
Some of her adult students have never handled a gun before, she said.  
“I cannot stress enough the safety factor,” Eisemann told the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission at a Jan. 13 meeting. “Safety first.” 
Eisemann was joined by a handful of instructors and hunting advocates who all urged commissioners to keep the in-person requirement in the state agency’s policy. They espoused benefits such as real-life firearm handling, simulations like crossing fences with guns and students getting facetime with wardens to go over Wyoming’s regulations. 
Ultimately, however, commissioners opted to modernize and go a direction that the majority of states already have. 
“We accept hunter safety certifications from other states, and now 33 states have an online-only version,” Game and Fish Commissioner Rusty Bell said.

That puts Wyoming wildlife officials in a bit of a bind. Even if they retained an in-person requirement, state-to-state reciprocity would enable Wyoming’s adult-onset hunters to enroll in online hunter safety courses offered by other states. And about 100 residents did just that in 2025, taking classes offered by Idaho and Nebraska, according to Game and Fish personnel. 
“That’s the hard part,” Game and Fish Communications Chief Roy Weber told WyoFile. “So we may as well offer a course that we feel is beneficial and covers the stuff we want to cover here in the state of Wyoming.” 
The specifics of Wyoming’s online-only hunter safety curriculum have not been decided. But, likely, the course will not include human instructors presenting remotely, he said. 
“More than likely, it would be online modules that you would take with quizzes,” Weber said. “That could change.” 
The exclusively online course should be available by early 2027. It will only be available to hunters over 18, which means that about two-thirds of Wyoming hunter safety students won’t be eligible.
Game and Fish Director Angi Bruce spoke in support of the policy change. 
“The research shows that … there isn’t a difference between the virtual or in-person [courses] with test scores,” Bruce told commissioners.

But some longtime hunter safety instructors worry that important lessons will be lost in the online-only format. Alan Brumsted was among those to testify against the policy change, and the Lander resident said he knows from experience that if a workaround is available to students, they’ll take it. 
“I guess I see the worst in people, because I was a teacher,” Brumsted told WyoFile. “How can a student get around what they have to do? What’s a shortcut?” 
Brumsted’s concern is that online test-takers will mindlessly scroll through required tutorials and then pass a test easily. Many of the questions have intuitive answers, he said.
“I worry about the integrity of the test,” Brumsted said. “And I worry about the fact that there’s just no accountability. There’s no in-person time for somebody to ask a question.” 
The Game and Fish Commission OK’d the new online-only option for hunter safety certificates in a 4-2 vote, with Commissioners Ken Roberts and John Masterson opposed. 
“I listen to the people who teach hunter education,” Masterson said, “and I cannot help but give them a great deal of deference.”
Roberts shared a similar rationale: “If the educators are saying we need to have [in-person courses] to make it a better program,” he said, “to me, we need to have it to make it a better program.” 
State wildlife management agencies have been requiring hunter safety certificates as a prerequisite for holding hunting licenses since the 1950s. The requirements were spurred by concerns over hunting-related injuries and fatalities.

The Freedom Caucus' capitalist wet dream for Wyoming will place the Cowboy State at an existential disadvantage, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post Back to the future with the Chemtrail Caucus appeared first on WyoFile .","What has the Wyoming Freedom Caucus been doing since we last checked on those gomers? Besides sitting around in red blazers and tinfoil Stetsons, staring at the sky and working up a lather over chemtrails and UFOs, I mean.

Opinion

It turns out they’ve been gazing into their murky crystal ball, and seeing a future for the Big Empty that is equally murky and sepia-toned like the faded photo of a 19th-century frontier ghost town. The Chemtrail Caucus is cranking out legislative initiatives that will set Wyoming back more than a hundred years, and they are high-fiving and back-slapping one another for turning back the clock.
Among the jokers that the Chemtrail Caucus pulled from the bottom of their marked deck is legislation to defund and dismantle the Wyoming Business Council, the organ of state government that allows Wyoming to compete nationally and globally in recruiting new businesses to the state.
They use tired old talking points from Adam Smith to claim that Wyoming must be a “free market” economy, and bootstrap ourselves to prosperity without government involvement. What they neglect to mention is that there isn’t a “free market” economy anywhere else in the world. And to turn Wyoming into some sort of capitalist wetdream is to place us at an existential disadvantage, and doom our young citizens to finding work nowhere but in the Ivermectin mines. Talk about stepping back from the future!
The past year has seen these nincompoops put roadblocks in the way of new energy projects that sought to capitalize on what Wyoming has to offer. But, oh no! Because these projects didn’t dovetail with their crystal ball vision of how they want our state to look in a decade or two, the tinfoil Stetson crowd dug in their heels and said, “Not in OUR state!”
As if that isn’t enough, the Chemtrail Caucus plans to whittle down funding for our only four-year university. Its vision of the University of Wyoming seems to be one dusty old sandstone building standing alone on the prairie. Inside it, no troubling liberal subjects are taught to the hungry young minds of tomorrow, only readin’, ritin’ and ‘rithmetic. Graduates will be perfectly positioned to find work on cattle drives or in the coal patch.
They want to axe funding for Wyoming Public Radio, simply because those stations don’t spew right-wing dogma, and don’t play enough Toby Keith and Kid Rock songs. And they want to divest public land in Wyoming simply because they don’t like feds.
The misguided gomers in the Chemtrail Caucus seem intent on reducing the tax base in the Cowboy State to the point that our dirt streets will run hock-deep in horseshit because our towns don’t have the wherewithal to take care of themselves. No fire departments, no water or sewer systems, no law enforcement, no schools … all our necessary infrastructure sacrificed on the altar of their populist pledge to cut taxes.
And, if they get their way, nobody will be able to vote except land-owning white males, just like it says in our original Constitution.
These knuckleheads don’t want to honor Wyoming’s past, they want to recreate it.
Because some of the Chemtrail Caucus’ anachronistic legislative efforts have been struck down as unconstitutional by the courts, its response is to reduce the number of justices on the Wyoming Supreme Court. They envision a future where the judicial branch will be reduced to only one or two circuit judges wandering horseback through the sagebrush, unable to thwart Wyoming’s inexorable slide backward in time.
It’s easy to conclude that the Chemtrail Caucus crystal ball contains only scenes of a glorified past in which kids die in flickering candlelight, unvaccinated against measles, smallpox and diphtheria. In its vision, Wyoming ekes out a meager existence as an energy colony for the rest of the world, lives hand-to-mouth on what we can scrounge for ourselves and yearns more for the past than the future.
When challenged to defend this bleak worldview, they thump their chests and say, “This is what the people voted for.”
Friends and neighbors, let’s take a gander into our own crystal ball and see what it says about our future.
Look! It says that the GOP primary election in Wyoming is Aug. 18 and we’ll all have the chance to use it as a referendum on the Chemtrail Caucus and the snake oil that they’ve tried to force down our throats since they took power in the last election. Since the Chemtrail Caucus is an abscess on our body politic, here’s our chance to remove it and prevent it from dragging us into the past.
At the risk of repeating myself, I’ll repeat myself … Aug. 18.

As the industry booms, so do the environmental consequences, including a massive energy demand and growing reliance on fossil fuels, writes guest columnist Ronn Smith.
The post The hidden toll of AI data centers appeared first on WyoFile .","Jonathan Swift once observed, “We have just enough religion to make us hate one another, but not enough to make us love one another.” In a modern-day analog, we have just enough artificial intelligence to devour massive amounts of energy and socialize the cost, but not enough to augment human intelligence meaningfully, efficiently or equitably.

Opinion

Thanks to AI, the combined electricity consumption of hyperscale data centers could double within the next three years. Planned projects call for a gigawatt of electricity each, enough to power 750,000 homes. Cheyenne hosts 14 data centers, with two more being constructed by Related Digital and Meta. Crusoe and Tallgrass announced plans for an additional 1.8 gigawatts in Cheyenne that may expand to 10 gigawatts. Nationally, data center demand is expected to grow from today’s 30 gigawatts to 134 gigawatts by 2030 – 17% of the entire country’s peak demand.
Market forces motivate utilities to offer data centers secret contracts that can shift costs to the public. This helps them compete in unregulated markets at the expense of their captive ratepayers. They tell public utility commissions what they want to hear: that special contracts isolate data center energy costs from other ratepayers’ bills. But verifying this claim is all but impossible.
Why? First, public utility commission rate-setting processes rely on the validity of data provided by utilities protecting their own interests. Second, their confidential agreements with data centers prevent full public participation in commission proceedings. Third, a complex system of state and federal cost allocation for additions to transmission capacity obscures the drivers of those costs and provides cover for regulatory approval. Fourth, surging data center demand may necessitate reliance on backup generators for “peak shaving.” Some data centers use backup generation during peak system load to cut their utility bill, leaving other consumers to absorb the discount. Finally, data centers may contract with merchant power plants, pulling them off the open market, straining grid capacity and raising regulated rates.
AI energy intensity amplifies environmental costs. Nationwide, 60% of the electricity used to power data centers comes from fossil fuels, releasing tens of thousands of tons per year of harmful air pollutants. The total annual public health burden of U.S. data centers could exceed $20 billion by 2028. Their carbon footprint is also escalating, with 105 million tons of greenhouse gases emitted in 2023, and potentially 250 million tons or more by 2035.

The Trump administration fosters this emissions upsurge by promoting fossil fuels and suppressing renewable energy expansion. EPA has embraced Trump’s executive order, “Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence.” Rather than earnestly enforcing Clean Air Act requirements, EPA now offers to assist data centers seeking to avoid permitting delays and disguise potential emissions. In its just-released website, EPA refers to its own permitting regulations as “overly burdensome red tape.”
The repurposed EPA recommends permitting loopholes that allow a data center that would normally qualify as a major source of air pollutants to avoid the attendant hurdle known as “prevention of significant deterioration.” Such permitting takes longer and requires more extensive modeling and monitoring. To stay under the minor-source emissions cap, EPA encourages AI generating plants to either split into pieces that qualify individually as minor sources, or to nominally constrain output (“synthetic minor source”).
Project Jupiter, a massive $165 billion AI data center in New Mexico proposed by OpenAI and Oracle, exploited both loopholes. They submitted minor source air permit applications for a combined 2.2 gigawatts of natural gas turbine capacity split between two microgrids. Each half of the project would further restrict its output to emit just under the minor source limit for nitrogen oxides.
AI developers may anticipate the political impracticality of enforcing minor source limits at a time of soaring power demand. Microsoft has pursued minor source permits for a borderline major source in Cheyenne. The Cheyenne Power Hub resisted this shortcut, submitting a PSD application to power the 1.8 gigawatts Crusoe/Tallgrass data center with natural gas turbines. Nonetheless, cumulative air quality impacts from current and future data centers on Cheyenne have been understated.
AI enthusiasts predict it will solve intractable problems like climate change. Ironically, its energy intensity and its rushed reliance on fossil fuels have reversed the decline in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. AI lacks either the reasoning power or conviction to connect its own excesses to the indisputable evidence that we are heating the planet. It seems unlikely that quadrupling its computing power will solve the paradox. Rather, we must depend on real intelligence to restrain our appetites, uphold quality over quantity and distinguish truth from nonsense.

Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis, would bar electric utilities from disconnecting low-income customers over the hottest months of the year, but is likely to undergo changes. Hamilton is pictured speaking in committee on Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026. (Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana lawmakers on Tuesday revised their ambitious electricity bill relief and performance-based ratemaking plan — with more changes likely.
House Bill 1002, a House Republican priority proposal, would reshape utility providers’ low-income customer assistance programs, block service shut-offs to those customers over dangerously hot months, put all ratepayers on predictable billing plans and refashion ratemaking into three-year plans featuring performance-based incentives.
The measure “is about modernizing how Indiana regulates electric utilities in … a way that better aligns utility incentives with the outcomes Hoosier families care about,” said author Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler, R-Noblesville. She spoke during a meeting of the House’s utilities committee.
Chair Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, cited last week’s testimony in proposing a first round of changes, which his committee accepted by consent.

The underlying legislation would require electricity suppliers under Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission jurisdiction to offer low-income customer aid programs.
Instead of funding those initiatives with money recovered from ratepayers under their IURC-approved energy efficiency programs — subject to mixed feedback — Soliday’s amendment mandates that companies fund that aid to at least 0.2% of revenue earned from residential customers in their jurisdictions.
“That may or may not be the right number; we’re still calculating,” he said.
It also would rename “budget” billing plans — which promote predictability for customers by holding monthly bill amounts steady despite changes in usage — to “levelized” billing. It would generally ban utilities from using the old term, which lawmakers previously complained could mislead customers.
House Bill 1002 would require that every customer be put a levelized plan, but be given the choice to opt out. Utilities would settle up with participants twice a year at most, at points that “reflect typical seasonal patterns of electricity usage.”
Companies may be required to put the true-up amount on customer bills under an expected second reading amendment Soliday encouraged Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, to flesh out.
Soliday’s amendment also lets the state’s ratepayer protection agency ask regulators to adjust an electricity supplier’s rates and performance mechanisms, and tweaks what’s included in a mechanism targeting service restoration.
The GOP-dominated committee also accepted revisions from Democratic members.
An amendment from Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, would codify quarterly reporting requirements on disconnections, arrearages and so on. The data would be submitted to the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, which represents customers in rate cases.
“Those kinds of data, I think, could be really helpful … to be able to essentially see how our people are doing, basically,” Pierce said. He pitched the change as a way to keep tabs on utility affordability overall, as well as assess the impacts of House Bill 1002 itself.
The OUCC has several years of data stemming from a pandemic-era settlement with utilities. 
No shortage of suggestions heard to improve electric service affordability measure

Another amendment from Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis, recast the legislation’s hot-weather disconnection ban for low-income customers. Initially, the pause would have been triggered by federal extreme heat warnings.
“I worry that there are many nearly equally dangerous heat days that will not be covered and put people at risk, and also that … someone could have their utilities turned off the day before and then not be restarted in time to deal with that that particular day,” she said. “So, this is just a cautionary amendment to provide more protection for our most vulnerable Hoosiers.”
Hamilton’s proposal, adopted in a 12-1 vote, would set a specific timeframe: June 1 through Sept. 23. Current law bans shut-offs in cold-weather months, from Dec. 1 through March 15.
Pierce argued it would be simpler to administer, but other supporters still expressed concerns — and lined up future changes.
“We really wrestled with this, Rep. Hamilton, because we do have folks that wind up with accruing (debt) with an abated disconnect … and they never catch up,” Soliday said. “And then, boom, we hit the winter months, and then we put them in a position that is almost unrecoverable.”
“I will encourage us to accept it, but don’t be surprised if, on second reading or over in the Senate, we compress this down a few months,” he added.
The committee defeated other proposed amendments, including Pierce’s elimination of the 7% sales tax on electricity services for residential customers. Soliday said the powerful Ways and Means Committee had already warned him that such a move would be promptly stripped out.
House Bill 1002 advanced in a unanimous, 13-0 vote. It next goes to the chamber floor.

(Photo courtesy of Becca Barth)A Wisconsin Senate committee held a public hearing Tuesday on legislation that would create a regulatory system for the cottage food industry in Wisconsin. 
In the hearing of the Committee on Transportation and Local Government, representatives of restaurants, commercial bakeries and grocery stores supported the proposal arguing that the bill would treat all food sellers equally, while the home bakers who would be affected by the bill complained that it would institute harsh income restrictions while subjecting them to requirements that aren’t relevant to the specifics of selling food out of a home kitchen. 
Authored by Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto), the bill has largely Republican support but Milwaukee-area Democratic Reps. Russell Goodwin and Sylvia Ortiz-Velez have signed on as co-sponsors. 
Under the bill, cottage food producers would be required to register with the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. As part of that registration, people would need to provide a list of all the foods they sell and an ingredient list for each item. Any producer that earns between $10,000 and $40,000 in revenue from their home business would be subject to inspections by DATCP. 
Anyone who makes more than $40,000 in revenue would no longer be considered a cottage food producer and would be required to obtain work space in a commercial kitchen. 
The cottage food industry in Wisconsin was allowed to grow after a 2017 lawsuit struck down a state law banning the sale of home baked goods. Since then, the state has operated with just the court precedent guiding the industry. 
Throughout the hearing, commercial industry representatives pushed for the passage of the bill as it’s written. Lobbying records show that the Wisconsin Bakers Association, Wisconsin Restaurants Association and Wisconsin Grocers Association have supported the bill. 
“You have created these rules for me, and I get to be surprise inspected and tested on them to ensure consumer food safety,” Chrissy Meisner, owner of a bakery in Bloomer and member of the Wisconsin Bakers Association, said. “It is clear, even in my small town, that your honor system of them following the rules doesn’t work. There seems to be a need for the same oversight you require of me to sell bread and cookies applied to everyone.”
While much of the testimony in favor of the bill focused on food safety issues, some of those in favor also said they were concerned about competition from home producers. 
“There’s only so much food that can be sold into a community,” Susan Quam, executive vice president of the Wisconsin Restaurant Association, said. “And everyone needs to fight for their share of those sales, whether it’s the grocery store, the local bakery, the restaurant or the cottage food baker. However, the first three are regulated, licensed, and have a lot of different and additional requirements that are put upon them to get that same very low profit margin.”
Home producers at the hearing said they would welcome regulation to tame their industry’s current wild west landscape, just not the regulations under the bill as currently written. The Wisconsin Farmers Union and the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty have both lobbied against the bill. 
The 2017 lawsuit that helped the industry bloom was litigated by the Institute for Justice, a national non-profit law firm focused on civil liberties. Ellen Hamlett, the organization’s activism manager, said she believes there’s “been a lot of industry pressure” to draft the current version of the bill. 
“Wisconsin’s cottage food laws are overdue for reform,” Hamlett said. “It is very important to note that the way that this bill is structured will jeopardize the living of many cottage food producers.”
Jobea Murray, president of the Wisconsin Cottage Food Association, said that the bill represents a huge administrative burden for both the home producers and for DATCP, which will not receive any additional funding for implementing the registration and inspection requirements under the bill. She also said the food safety certifications required under the bill are specific to restaurant-like settings, which won’t help make home produced products safer. 
“So we want to work with you to get this right,” Murray said. “[The bill] is a great starting point, but it needs significant changes to truly support Wisconsin’s cottage food economy.”
A lot of the opposition to the bill was centered around the $40,000 revenue cap. Several speakers noted that most states that allow the sale of cottage foods have no cap or else set their caps much higher. Iowa and Illinois do not set a cap on their cottage food sales while Minnesota’s revenue cap is $78,000.

People are already declaring candidacy for office, and the political ads will start ramping up soon. With all the time and money spent to convince voters who to support, I worry that one major issue will be overlooked – disability. There isn’t a clear playbook being handed down by either of the two major parties about how to address the many challenges and opportunities people with disabilities face and most politicians are seemingly uncomfortable talking about their own disabilities.
Disability is just a word to describe having a condition that changes how you complete a task, it’s not a weakness or a flaw. Here in Montana, more than one in four people live with a disability. Yet despite how common disability is, it is still rarely reflected in business, community, or political leadership. National figures suggest that only about 10% of politicians and organizational leaders publicly identify as having a disability. That raises an important question: Why isn’t the largest minority community more openly represented among our lawmakers?
Before we can dig into that, it’s worth understanding why this matters.
People with disabilities are affected by every policy decision and more than half of all policy decisions directly affect our disabilities. From health care and education to housing, transportation, employment, and voting access, disability intersects with nearly every area of public life. And yet, political candidates rarely run on disability-specific issues or speak openly about disability as part of their identity.
Within the disability community, we often say, “Nothing about us, without us.” 
This has been thought to mean that people with lived experience should be included and have a seat at the table when decisions are made that affect us. We are ready for more than politicians simply doing things to us, or for us, we want policies built with us. We are looking for true representation. We want leadership that understands disability not just in theory, but in real life experience and impact. 
Voters fully appreciate how powerful shared experience is in leadership. Rural communities support rural candidates. Veterans trust veteran leaders. Parents connect with leaders who understand family life. Shared experience builds trust, accountability, and better decision-making. The same is true for people with disabilities.
Disability is more common and diverse than most people realize. It includes physical, mental, or neurological conditions that affect your life. This can mean chronic illness, autoimmune conditions, mental health challenges, ADHD, hearing loss, cancer, substance use disorders, or physical impairments. Disabilities can impact any number of everyday things like breathing, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, sleeping, caring for ourselves, and working. Some disabilities are present at birth, while others develop through illness, injury, or aging. 
Simply put, disability is any physical or mental condition that makes it difficult or changes how you navigate everyday tasks to live your life.
And despite how natural and common place this is, many leaders who live with these conditions remain silent about them.
I encourage leaders with disabilities to identify themselves, not for attention, but for impact. When leaders are open about their disability, they create space for others to lead with pride. They show young people, newly disabled individuals, and aging community members that leadership is attainable, and they can have a part in the decisions that are being made about their lives.
The decision not to disclose a disability is often rooted in fear of stigma and the risk of judgment from voters. It’s time to look beyond that and it’s time to embrace disability as a common human experience. An experience that provides great insight, adaptability, creativity, and perspective which are exactly the qualities we should look for in our political leaders.
  We need more representation 

Disability is a shared human experience that connects millions of people across every community from every walk of life. When candidates run openly on disability issues and when leaders are honest about their own disabilities, they do more than represent a community. They empower and encourage engagement, normalize inclusion, challenge old stigmas, and help shape policies that reflect real lives. 
Disability Rights Montana is nonpartisan, and our goal is to elevate the voices of people with disabilities and create space to discuss the issues that matter most to our community. As we enter this election season, the disability community is looking to identify disability champions. Candidates should feel encouraged to share their lived experiences which have shaped their values across physical, sensory, cognitive, and health differences even if they have never previously thought of themselves as part of the disability community.
If you have a disability or have a family member with a disability and are currently in office or are thinking about running for office, I assure you that the disability community wants to hear from you, we want to hear how your experiences with disabilities give you the insight and moral leadership we need from the policy makers who represent us.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2249051956.jpg,,,2026-01-21 06:58:18.128336

Cynara Johnson has lived in a manufactured home that she owns at the West Village Estates park in Romulus, for nearly nine years — and for that whole time, she has been fighting the real estate investment trust that owns the park, Sun Communities, to address dangerous maintenance issues on her property. She says she has only been ignored, stonewalled and even retaliated against. 
In April 2017, Johnson first noticed a crack in her ceiling and a strange smell in and around her home. For years, she dealt with consistent flooding in the park that reached her yard and her home, but the park management did nothing about it when she alerted them to it, according to a complaint that Johnson filed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.
Sun Communities did not respond to a request for comment on this story.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
By June 2025, she was smelling sewage coming from underneath the home, and her bathroom floor was becoming increasingly unsteady. She learned months later, after contacting advocates with MHAction, a national group working for residents of manufactured homes, that the sewer connection under her home had become completely separated and that raw sewage was spilling into the crawlspace. 
“This sewage appeared to be draining down the walkway toward the street and was constant. It continued even when it was not raining outside. Every morning, I would sweep down the walkway and disinfect it with bleach because of the smell,” Johnson, who is 55 years old and disabled, wrote in her complaint.

After she requested an inspection from the city of Romulus in December, city building officials found that the sewer pipe had been reconnected, but that lingering damage from the sewage spillage had caused “potential structural, sanitary and health-related concerns,” a city report details. 
At the inspection — where both Johnson and Marge Wisniewski, a resident leader with MHAction, showed documentation of the issues — city officials observed both indoor and outdoor concerns. Sanitary cleanup, foundation and tie-down repairs, and moisture and growth remediation were required corrections to Johnson’s home, but the city did not assign responsibility for making those corrections to either her or the park ownership, instead leaving it up to the two parties to determine that themselves.

Johnson said that since the sewer line was reconnected by park owners on Dec. 9, they have ignored her daily messages. 
Now, she just wants to get out of her home and escape the safety and sanitation concerns that linger. A GoFundMe account has been set up to help her do that. However, questions about her mortgage, her insurance and what to do with the building she owns — which Wisniewski said should be condemned — are keeping her from finding a new permanent home.
“I do feel like I’m being ran in circles from the park owner, that’s for sure,” Johnson said. “Every time I inquire about being relocated until the repairs are done, I’m ignored.”

Johnson is far from the only manufactured housing resident facing concerns like this, Wiesnewski explained. In parks across Michigan and nationwide, especially those owned by private equity firms and real estate investment trusts like Sun Communities, residents are often charged skyrocketing rents and ignored or even retaliated against when they come forward with maintenance or sanitation concerns.
“If you look back historically,” Wisniewski explained, “they were mom-and-pop operations, and they were tended to, and the owners cared, and they knew the residents, and they looked out for them. It definitely changed overnight.”
“That’s why these places have been allowed to just smolder like this for years, because nobody wants to come forward,” she added. “You feel trapped.”
And that feeling of being trapped and ignored by the park ownership has taken its toll on Johnson, leading her to seek mental health treatment over it. 
“It’s hard. It’s very hard. From day one, I’ve been told that it’s my fault, I have a leak,” she said. “That’s always the answer to whatever I bring to them.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4621-768x1024.jpg,,,2026-01-21 06:58:18.128336

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Republican and Democratic lawmakers are backing elimination of the state’s grocery sales tax this year despite worries about flagging revenues.
Democratic Rep. Aftyn Behn of East Nashville said Tuesday she will refile House Bill 2, which would end the state’s roughly 4% sales tax on grocery items and close corporate tax loopholes to offset the loss in revenue. The measure failed to advance in a finance subcommittee last year.
Likewise, Republican Rep. Todd Warner of Chapel Hill filed HB1530, which would exempt food and food ingredients from the state’s sales tax, a measure with an $800 million price tag.
Warner said Tuesday the state’s budget, roughly $59.8 billion, has grown nearly 59% since Gov. Bill Lee took office seven years ago. 
“I think it’s time we give back to the taxpayers of Tennessee by taking the state’s portion of the sales tax off groceries, which would result in about an $800 million return to the taxpayers,” Warner said.
Warner’s bill does not include a method for recouping the lost revenue while Behn’s bill would offset the revenue loss by requiring companies that shelter money in offshore accounts to pay their share of taxes. He said the state could cut private-school vouchers to make a grocery tax cut possible.

– Rep. Todd Warner, R-Chapel Hill


Behn said Tuesday the corporate tax base under Republican control has eroded significantly, causing the state to move toward a “fiscal cliff,” despite a promise by GOP lawmakers that they’re going to deal with an “affordability crisis.”
“Tennessee is 13 FedEx subsidiaries in a trench coat,” Behn said, referring to decisions to give tax breaks to multinational corporations while shortchanging people.
Lawmakers approved business tax breaks and rebates in 2023 and 2024 that cost the state billions of dollars in revenue and caused corporate tax collections for last year to fall off by 15.8%, a decrease of $721.5 million from the previous year.
In contrast, sales tax collections went up 4.2%, $596 million in that time frame, according to state figures.
Memphis-based FedEx and its subsidiaries, as well as Lee Company, a mechanical engineering and HVAC, plumbing and electrical services company owned by Lee’s family, joined Amazon, Nissan, AT&T and utilities such as Atmos Energy and Alabama Power in netting franchise and excise tax rebates of more than $10,000 each created by a 2024 state law. In all, 60,000 companies received three-year refunds estimated at $1.5 billion.
Behn’s bill, carried in the Senate by Democratic Sen. Charlane Oliver of Nashville, also would enact a corporate minimum tax generating $900 million. They say their argument is backed by a state report showing Tennessee’s most profitable companies are avoiding taxes, and Behn pointed out that several Republican-controlled states such as Texas passed similar laws.
Grocery tax cuts compete for support in Tennessee legislature

“This supermajority’s not delivering for Tennesseans, and the Republicans up here are getting jittery,” Behn said. “There’s no new money coming in. They don’t have money for their pet projects, and they don’t have money to tell their constituents they delivered for them, which is why they’re going after immigrants.”
Republican leaders introduced a slate of bills last week designed to eliminate undocumented immigration in the state, a move likely to overshadow other legislation this year.
Republican Sen. Bo Watson of Hixson and Republican Rep. Elaine Davis of Knoxville are sponsoring a grocery sales tax reduction too, but it’s unclear whether they will push the bill.
Watson, chairman of the Senate finance committee, said it is one of several tax-related bills that will be considered to see if they’re possible.
“All those are math problems,” Watson said. “I don’t know what we’ll be able to do until we see what the governor gives us on Feb. 2,” Watson said.
Lee is to give his final State of the State address on Groundhog Day.
Watson said he has no idea which spending items would be cut so the grocery tax could be eliminated without affecting state revenue.

Bill Cassidy talks with reporters in the Dirksen Senate office building on Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2025. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Disappointment, disdain, frustration, humiliation.
Any of these words could describe sentiment inside the camp of Bill Cassidy after President Donald Trump issued a surprise statement Saturday night in support of U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow in this fall’s U.S. Senate election in Louisiana. 
One word that doesn’t apply: Surprise.
In the world of whim and petulance that Trump has created within the Republican Party, there should be no one close to Cassidy who was caught off guard when the president gave his endorsement to Letlow. Nobody could be shocked that Trump held on to a five-year-old grudge against Cassidy for voting to impeach him in January 2021.
Despite repeated attempts to ingratiate himself with Trump in the interim, Cassidy has failed to mend fences with the president and — more importantly for his reelection bid — the sizable share of MAGA voters in Louisiana.
A November poll from the conservative Pelican Institute showed Cassidy with 22% support. All other candidates combined for 37%, and another 41% were undecided. Among Republican respondents, Cassidy held a 29% to 22% advantage over state Treasurer John Fleming, who told The Times-Picayune’s Tyler Bridges after Letlow’s entry that he will stay in the race.
But Fleming could also be feeling jilted after Trump’s pledge of allegiance to Letlow. The former congressman was a White House deputy chief of staff and assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Commerce during the first Trump administration. Yet there was never an inkling of a suggestion that Trump would back Fleming, the candidate who was arguably the closest to his inner circle.
With Louisiana’s move to closed party primaries for this year’s elections, the rest of the announced Republican field faces long odds against Cassidy and now Letlow. Qualifying takes place Feb. 11-13, by which time some are likely to pull out of the race.
Public Service Commission Eric Skrmetta of Metairie, one of Trump’s Louisiana campaign chairmen in 2016, has been at the back of the field with little signs of gaining momentum.
Sen. Blake Miguez of New Iberia has also failed to gain traction, even though he was the first recognizable name to throw his hat in the ring in June. His chances took a hit after he found himself at odds with Gov. Jeff Landry over tax policy.
Rep. Julie Emerson of Carencro, the state lawmaker who frequently carries legislation for the governor, announced in October she would challenge Cassidy. Her highly polished launch has yet to show results in polling, however. 
Landry was with Attorney General Liz Murrill after a U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeal hearing Tuesday on Louisiana’s Ten Commandments law when they were asked about Letlow’s newly announced candidacy. Murrill said Letlow “would make a great United States senator,” and Landry agreed with that statement.
The betting money right now is for Cassidy and Letlow to emerge from the Republican Party primary in May to meet in a June runoff. Letlow will have to make up a sizable gap in fundraising, as Cassidy’s campaign says it has more than $26 million at its disposal. He also has a slew of endorsements from sheriffs and parish presidents along with the financial backing of Louisiana’s major GOP donors.
Cassidy has continued to lean on his conservative track record since Letlow’s announcement, though it’s not likely to change the opinions of voters who occupy the far right. Their minds were made up when the senator cast his vote to impeach Trump. 
Moderate Republicans and no-party voters who take part in the GOP primary will have a hard time overlooking Cassidy’s nod for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary. Though he can’t take back his deciding confirmation vote, Cassidy might choose to be more openly critical of RFK Jr. now that Trump has given him the cold shoulder.
Another factor worth watching: Does Trump continue to see his popularity plummet with his unyielding stances on Greenland and immigration enforcement, to the point where candidates start to play down his endorsement?
It’s indeed hard to imagine a scenario where Louisiana Republicans shun Trump’s support and MAGA voters reject his chosen candidates. But who would have ever thought the leader of the United States would threaten our longtime European allies with the use of military force?
Strange times make for strange elections, and it’s far too early to count out a well-funded Cassidy amid so much turmoil.

Because rural folks tend to be older, poorer, and sicker than those living in urban areas, the issues of health care access and availability are especially pressing. Over the years, there have been several initiatives and programs to help address the various components of effective rural health care delivery, including provider shortages and financing issues.
During the time from 2009 until 2024 when I was vice president for health affairs at the University of North Dakota and dean of the UND School of Medicine and Health Sciences, we worked hard to help address rural health care challenges, mainly through our Healthcare Workforce Initiative. This effort helped address provider workforce and other related issues. The initiative has been gratifyingly successful, as we’ve been able to increase the retention of UND health care graduates for practice within the state.
But more needs to be done, and that’s why the recently announced Rural Health Transformation Program is so timely. Our congressional delegation, Gov. Kelly Armstrong, Interim Health and Human Services Commissioner Pat Traynor, and the director of our Center for Rural Health Jacob Warren deserve credit and our thanks for securing $199 million – and potentially more in the future – to bolster rural health care services with a continued focus on workforce issues. 
This infusion of such major financial support undoubtedly will help to address the ongoing issues of rural health care access and availability. As the various components of the program are implemented, all of us should be mindful of a few important caveats. The first is that it is vitally important that whatever is done with this infusion of dollars has lasting impact and is not just a temporary prop-up of a currently tenuous system. 
Related to this long-term perspective is a concern about the future funding of rural health care in general. The United States spends almost $5 trillion a year on health care, more than any other country, in both absolute terms and when adjusted for population. Despite that, our health care outcomes are not necessarily the best in the world – often they are far from it. So, it is more than reasonable to try to rein in those expenditures. 
But the magnitude of the pending cuts to Medicaid, which funds much of the health and supportive care and assistance for low income and senior citizens, as well as the subsidies related to the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), will dwarf the additional funding provided through the Rural Health Transformation Program.
Rural folks will be especially impacted by the pending cuts in funding for health insurance. The outcome of the funding cuts will be that more rural people will become uninsured or underinsured, and that will have a negative impact on their health. Regardless of whether one is a supporter or a critic of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, I think that few would disagree with the premise that having as many North Dakotans with health insurance is a good thing, as it is clear that people enjoy better health and health outcomes when they have adequate health insurance.
The cuts in health care spending on Medicaid and the ACA are estimated to be about $1.1 trillion over the next 10 years. While North Dakota’s share of the cuts obviously would be much smaller, it will have a devastating impact on rural health care delivery and rural health care. It will be important, therefore, for our elected leaders to address this conundrum of a wonderful increase in short-term funding to support rural health care on one hand while there will be a larger longer-term funding cut.
Finally, when our state’s legislators meet this week in a special session called by the governor, they will debate and act on four bills related to the Rural Health Transformation Program. While I think that it is best, in general, to leave the specifics of regulating health care delivery to the various state boards so empowered by the Legislature and keep the government out of the way in matters where it doesn’t have particular expertise, I don’t think there will be too much controversy regarding the proposed bills. 
The one exception likely will be the bill giving more prescribing authority to pharmacists. As a physician, I feel the paramount issue is what’s best for the patient, and not a fight over turf. I have no insight into the outcome of the bill, but I hope that the concept of teamwork and cooperation among the various members of the health care team is emphasized. I consult with the pharmacists on our team almost every day when I’m seeing patients, and that team approach really works. I’d hate to see it degenerate into an arm wrestle. Time will tell.
Regardless, the Rural Transformation project has a good chance of achieving just that – a transformation of the rural health care landscape – if some of the concerns discussed above can be addressed successfully.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2213292226-1024x698.jpg,,,2026-01-21 06:58:18.128336

A few days later, the violence ICE is perpetrating in our city arrived, literally, on our doorstep: Armed masked men raided our neighbors’ homes, remaining at our corner for two long hours. As we prayed and cared for those around us, several of our pastors and staff were among those who were pepper-bombed.
Our city is under siege, and when we asked the children in our congregation how they are feeling, they told us, unsurprisingly, that they feel scared. One youth, the child of an immigrant, texted his grandmother in the middle of the night: “I’m scared every day i live in fear and I don’t know what to do if your awake please call me.”
How can we comfort our children? We feel scared too.
We can start by acknowledging that we — unlike Renee Good, unlike George Floyd — have lived to breathe another day. For one more day, we have the privilege of following the way of Jesus, who called on us to feed the hungry, clothe the naked — and welcome the stranger.
And so, in this climate of fear, we turn to that life-affirming work. Immigrant families are afraid to venture outside. We’ve had to cancel our children’s choir practice until we can confidently gather the children safely.
Yet a few children and their moms still rallied to go grocery shopping for immigrant families, delivering boxes to a local McDonald’s where many immigrants work. In distributing Happy Meals to the appreciative children, the assistant manager offered a lesson in how mutual care strengthens the bonds of community. “When you share,” he explained in his accented English, “we share.”
We wish that feeding one another during these terrible times would be enough. But our young people tell us it is not. As one of our youth said, “I want to make sure my friends are not stolen from their families.” Another child asked, “Could you make ICE disappear? They hurt people.”
Jesus understood what it meant to live under an occupying force — in his case, the Roman Empire. He understood the helplessness. He understood the stakes, and yet he persisted in showing us, before ultimately dying from the violence, that another way — a way of love — is possible.
So we will continue to deliver groceries. We will make arrangements so that, if the unfathomable happens, the children can stay with other families. And from the epicenter of this occupation, we send out the children’s plea: Please. Make the people who are hurting people disappear.

“I think we just gotta break this cycle. We can’t continue to have thousands and thousands of kids being raised by the state of West Virginia,” Mark Drennan, vice president for the National Youth Advocate Program, told members of the Senate Health Committee on Tuesday afternoon.

Meanwhile, Senate Democrats held a press conference earlier that day, saying foster care reform is a top priority for the two of them this session. They said the Republican supermajority must increase the state’s financial investment in child welfare. 
“I’m focused mainly on our foster care crisis, which has gone on for too many years,” Senate Minority Leader Mike Woelfel said. “I call on the Senate President Randy Smith to appoint an ad hoc committee right away to address the crisis of our foster children.”
There are around 6,000 children in West Virginia foster care, and thousands more children coming into contact with the child welfare system every year. State lawmakers have struggled for years to improve the foster care system and address high Child Protective Services case loads, a lack of safe homes for children and other problems. 
A child in West Virginia foster care was recently injured while living in an Airbnb short-term rental property after the state placed the minor there because of the lack of foster homes and treatment beds available for foster children.
Woelfel, D-Cabell, and Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, laid out a plan to reporters to tackle the foster care crisis, including requiring CPS to launch a formal investigation or conduct family assessments based on the severity of the child abuse and neglect allegations. 
“[There] needs to be an increase in funding for additional CPS workers,” Woelfel said. “The health and safety of the least among us, which are the foster children, should be a primary focus.”
While the governor’s proposed budget requested an $11 million increase for foster care, Senate Democrats say it’s not enough, and said it should be $20 million to increase in-state placements for children, support nonprofits helping foster children and more. 
Garcia said that the estimated $125 million price tag for the governor’s proposed 5% tax cut should instead be used to increase funding for foster care.
“We think it’s something we can really do,” Garcia said. “We can actually reduce the number of people in foster care … Twenty-five kids are in hotels, Airbnbs. Let’s make that number zero. That’s something we can get done right now.”
Sen. Vince Deeds, R-Greenbrier
Sen. Vince Deeds, R-Greenbrier, has led the charge on the Senate’s foster care reform bills. He was “excited about” child welfare being a priority for the Senate’s Democratic members.
“I think it is so important that all of us collaborate and make the best ideas possible,” Deeds said. “Children and citizens are at the center of their conversations every day. I think having their input will be critical.”
Senate, House committees advance foster care bills; some will need funding
The Senate Health Committee approved two foster care bills on Tuesday, including Senate Bill 436 that would require the Department of Human Services to develop a statewide prevention plan in an effort to reduce the number of children coming into care. West Virginia has for years led the nation in the rate of children coming into foster care. 
The prevention services would be offered to children who are at risk of entering foster care or already involved in a CPS case, pregnant and parenting youth and children aging out of foster care after their 21st birthday.
“I think it’s really crucial that we look at that situation and really try to do a lot of prevention,” Drennan said. “I think we need support for foster parents, for kinship placements, for grandparents and parents.”
Deeds, who sponsored the measure along with Garcia, said that the DoHS was already doing some preventive efforts in foster care, and this would expand those efforts. The bill would mandate that the department collect information about preventive services and share it with lawmakers so they can make better decisions about the child welfare system. 
“So we can make improvements within the department for those young people who may have made contact with the department but don’t need the full gamut of human services care. The preventive measures are so they can stay out of the system,” Deeds explained. 
The Senate Health Committee approved Senate Bill 228, sponsored by Deeds and Woelfel, would require DoHS to implement a pilot project in two counties where they’d use mobile device to assist CPS workers in child abuse and neglect investigations. It would reduce the need for a CPS worker to input data manually into a system and potentially help with reducing the time spent on paperwork. 
The pair of foster care bills now goes to the Senate Finance Committee for consideration. Deeds estimated the prevention care bill would cost around $45,000. There isn’t yet a cost estimate for the other measure involving mobile devices for CPS workers.
In the House, members of the Committee on Health advanced several of their own foster care measures Tuesday, including their version of the prevention plan bill. 
Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis
They committee advanced legislation that would change the state’s clothing voucher program for foster children. The program currently provides a $375 voucher for families to use only at Gabe’s, a discount chain store that has limited locations in West Virginia. 
“It all has to be spent at one time,” said bill sponsor Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis, a foster parent. “You are limited to what is inside Gabe’s, so let’s say if you got an infant and they needed bottles, you wouldn’t be able to purchase those bottles or car seats or whatever other necessities that you might need.”
His bill, House Bill 4354, would give families an “instant card” to purchase clothing and necessary items for foster children. Families could also be eligible for reimbursements for items they purchased for children.
The bill was sent to the House Finance Committee for consideration.

(Photo courtesy of Mindy Robinson)A team of AmeriCorps volunteers in West Virginia is honoring Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy by restocking 18 food and supply pantries across the state this month. 
This is the third year the Lifebridge AmeriCorps program, sponsored by the United Way of Central West Virginia, will endeavor to collect items for the pantries.
Program manager Mindy Robinson said the project is not limited to food pantries, but includes pet pantries, and those that collect items for babies like diapers.
In 2024, the team collected more than 6,000 items. Last year they collected about 6,800.
“Every year, our numbers get better and better,” Robinson said. “So I think they’re starting to realize we’re here for a while.”
As part of the project, volunteers pick a pantry site and then use social media, press releases and word of mouth to help promote restocking items, Robinson said. Volunteers are encouraged to promote the restock effort to the community and with other nonprofit organizations in the area. 
For example, in Morgantown, the United Way of Monongalia and Preston Counties has partnered with the city of Morgantown to get more donations for their pantry choice there, she said. 
“So just being able to push it out on social media, through press releases, word of mouth and just partnerships, it’s really starting to kick off on those fronts,” she said.
Robinson said the LifeBridge team emphasizes service projects — members do four each year. The restock is one project they do as a cohort. The project is meant to be in remembrance of King and all the good he did. 
“That’s what we decided to do, just try to come together as neighbors and help our other neighbors,” she said. 
To help the team restock the pantries, Robinson said people can contact the AmeriCorps program by phone at 304-340-3504 to find a drop off site near them. They can also see the team’s Facebook account, LifeBridge AmeriCorps Program, where volunteers regularly post about the different pantries they’re helping to support.

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)Lawmakers in the Colorado General Assembly are reviving a proposal to offer tax breaks for data center operators, aligning the state with dozens of other states competing for the favor of a fast-growing industry that has become a magnet for both investor dollars and public scrutiny.
House Bill 26-1030, introduced last week, would offer a 100% sales and use tax exemption for qualified data centers for at least 20 years. A similar proposal was postponed indefinitely at the end of the 2025 legislative session after pushback from environmental and consumer advocates.
The bill’s supporters, who include moderate Democrats at the statehouse and a coalition of tech industry groups, say Colorado is falling behind in the race to build data centers, the sprawling server farms that power artificial intelligence, cloud computing services and other related technologies.

“Despite having a strong technology ecosystem, despite having a strong workforce here in Colorado, available power, available land — the state is not yet a strong data center market,” Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, said during a media briefing Tuesday.
At least 37 states now offer incentives for the development and operation of data centers, industry representatives said, characterizing the sales tax breaks as a prerequisite for substantial investment, especially when it comes to the so-called “hyperscale” data centers that serve the largest AI and cloud-computing companies.










Across the country, we are seeing the negative impacts of large data center development without meaningful community and ratepayer protections in place.


– Megan Kemp, Colorado policy representative, Earthjustice


“From an overall industry perspective … they only go to places with the state-level sales and use tax exemption,” said Jacob Bock, vice president for land strategy at Tract, a Denver-based data center development company. “I talk to some of my colleagues that previously worked at the likes of Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and the No. 1 state on all of their lists, that they would love to build in, was Colorado — with the barrier-to-entry issue being the sales and use tax exemption.”
A fiscal analysis of HB-1030 has not yet been released, but nonpartisan legislative analysts estimated last year that a sales tax exemption for data centers would decrease general fund revenue by $38 million annually.
Amid a nationwide boom in data center construction, largely driven by investment in AI, polling shows a growing number of Americans concerned about the energy-intensive facilities’ impact on the environment, and what the surging demand for energy could do to utility rates paid by consumers. Data centers made up about 4.4% of all U.S. electricity demand in 2023, and that figure could rise to 12% by 2028, the Department of Energy has estimated.
A Carnegie Mellon University study published in July estimated that the demand surge could increase costs for residential ratepayers by 8% as electric utilities struggle to add enough generating capacity to keep up, with higher rate spikes in areas with high concentrations of data centers. Environmental advocates also worry the increased strain on the grid could jeopardize clean-energy goals, and electricity providers in many parts of the U.S. are already expanding or prolonging the use of fossil-fuel-powered generation to meet the anticipated demand increase.
Lawmakers fear AI data centers will drive up residents’ power bills

Sponsors of HB-1030, including House Majority Leader Monica Duran, a Wheat Ridge Democrat, say their bill addresses both concerns.
“It’s no secret that other states have faced challenges implementing hasty policies to attract data centers,” Duran said Tuesday. “We will not be making the same mistakes, and our bill creates a strong and protective framework that will bring data centers here, but on our terms — the Colorado way.”
The bill would create a new Colorado Data Center Development Authority under the state’s office of economic development. In order for a data center to qualify for the tax incentive, the authority would require the electric utility that will provide power to the facility to “verify that the data center will not cause unreasonable cost impacts to other utility ratepayers.”
In the event that a utility needed to make a “targeted resource acquisition” to expand its generating capacity to serve a new data center, the bill would require at least 75% of the new capacity to come from clean energy sources. After Jan. 1, 2040, that requirement would rise to 100%.
Opposition to ‘handouts’
A coalition of environmental and progressive groups on Tuesday announced their opposition to HB-1030, which they called a “data center handout bill” that doesn’t go far enough to establish guardrails on development.
“Across the country, we are seeing the negative impacts of large data center development without meaningful community and ratepayer protections in place,” Megan Kemp, Colorado policy representative for environmental group Earthjustice, said in a statement. “Colorado has the opportunity to lead in ensuring that data centers develop without harm to our residents. Now is the time to advance legislation that truly puts Coloradans’ health, well-being and wallets first.”
Opponents of HB-1030 said a forthcoming bill from other Democratic lawmakers, including state Sen. Cathy Kipp of Fort Collins and Rep. Kyle Brown of Louisville, would better address “concerns about data centers’ energy demand, ratepayer and community protections, and climate goals.”
But state Rep. Alex Valdez, a Denver Democrat and HB-1030 sponsor, said the alternative proposal was “not tenable for industry.”
“We believe that we’ve struck the exact right balance between what is doable, and what is the best in terms of stewardship,” Valdez said. “This takes into account the realities of the situation, and gets there in a very clean way.”

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The seven current members of the Mississippi Supreme Court on Tuesday quizzed attorneys for State Auditor Shad White and Attorney General Lynn Fitch over which statewide official can bring a lawsuit to recoup misspent taxpayer money. 
During oral arguments in a case that involves Mississippi’s massive welfare scandal, Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre and the two Republican statewide officials, justices Josiah Coleman and Kenny Griffis, appeared vexed that the two agencies, which should be working on behalf of state taxpayers, were arguing in court over the issue. 
“So, what are we fighting about?” Griffis asked at one point. 
The issue is over a section of Mississippi law stating that the auditor is “to institute suit, and the attorney general shall prosecute the same in any court of the state,” when recovering misspent tax dollars.
Fitch first took White to court when the auditor attempted to sue Favre to recoup a portion of allegedly misspent welfare money. 
Fitch, as the state’s top legal officer, believes she has the exclusive right to file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state, and it would be unrealistic to compel the attorney general to file litigation she doesn’t believe is legitimate. 
White believes the plain reading of the state law clearly gives him the authority to initiate lawsuits and requires the attorney general to follow through and prosecute on his behalf. 
A Hinds County chancery judge sided with White, so the attorney general appealed to the state’s highest court.
But if White were to prevail, Justice Coleman questioned how this auditor and attorney general scenario would work in reality, especially under situations where the attorney general and state auditor disagree over how litigation should proceed. 
Lawyers have an ethical and professional responsibility to tell the truth in court and in court filings, so Coleman asked, in a hypothetical situation, if the attorney general was supposed to forsake those obligations simply because a state auditor wanted to pursue a claim.

“If we reduce everything to the absurd, we can always find the limits,” Clay Baldwin, an attorney for White, answered. 
“It’s not absurd that a lawyer would have a client or a potential client come to them and ask them to pursue a case that, in that lawyer’s judgment, has no merit and is frivolous,” Coleman responded.
Baldwin then argued that if the attorney general’s office refused, state law allows an agency to seek outside counsel. 
The money at the center of the legal fight between the two statewide officials is about $730,000 that White claims Favre owes the state because of unpaid interest. 
Fitch’s office, on behalf of the Mississippi Department of Human Services, sued dozens of defendants, including Favre, to try to recoup allegedly misspent welfare money. But it did not include funds that White’s office is pursuing.
Griffis asked Scott Stewart, Mississippi’s solicitor general, who argued on behalf of Fitch, whether the attorney general’s office ever planned to file a suit to claw back this money. Stewart did not answer the question directly and said the office would have to make a “final determination” on the matter. 
“When this court is deciding things, it’s not just about this case,” Stewart argued. “It’s about many, many cases. It’s about the rule of law that is going to control in many, many cases.” 
Stewart’s response highlighted how little information and how few updates the public has received on the massive scandal that auditors said resulted in the loss of at least $100 million in federal funds meant to assist the needy, reduce poverty or feed the hungry from 2016 to 2020.

For the last two weeks, former wrestler Teddy DiBiase has been standing trial for his alleged role in the scandal.
Neither Fitch nor White was in the courtroom on Tuesday. The two officials have said they’re considering running for governor and have clashed in recent years over the handling of the scandal.
Fitch also withdrew her office’s representation of the auditor in two defamation lawsuits, including one filed by Favre, after determining a book White wrote about the welfare scandal cast her office in a negative light and created a conflict of interest.
Tuesday’s arguments were somewhat unusual, as a full court participated. But only seven justices are currently on the usual nine-member court because the U.S. Senate recently confirmed two of the former members as federal judges in northern Mississippi. 
It’s unclear when the justices will deliver a ruling in the case, but the court typically issues rulings on Thursdays.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20170650/Supreme-Court-AG-Fitch-v-State-Auditor-Shad-White-2.jpg,,,2026-01-21 06:58:18.128336

(Photo by Jesus Vargas/Getty Images)In the days following the Trump administration’s kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro, Tennessee’s Republican lawmakers took to social media to praise the congressionally unauthorized attack. 
U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty referenced allegations against Maduro for his supposed involvement in fentanyl and cocaine “narcoterrorism.” Since Americans are wise to the term “WMDs,” — or, weapons of mass destruction, the alleged reason for the U.S. to invade Iraq — the moniker “narcoterrorist” is a new one the Trump admin began using to justify unsanctioned missile strikes on boats in the Caribbean and East Pacific, including the killing of wounded sailors who had survived previous U.S. attacks.
Reps. Tim Burchett, Chuck Fleischmann, and David Kustoff spoke more towards Maduro’s dictatorial leadership as being sufficient justification for deposing him. As they were writing their press releases, they must’ve forgotten to give their constituents their reasons for why the U.S. doesn’t apply that same principle to the many dictatorships America supports, funds, and arms.
Missing from the conversation entirely was any mention of whether or not Tennesseans want their elected representatives to support regime change.
American support for foreign entanglements fades by the minute
This isn’t the Cold War era. Propaganda and politicians’ lies don’t work like they used to, and every American generation alive today has its own horror stories of one or more U.S. conquests abroad, be it Korea, Iran, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Panama, Afghanistan, Iraq, or Libya. 
U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett was among several Tennessee congressmen who said Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro’s dictatorial style was sufficient for the U.S. to remove him, without questioning why the U.S. supports other dictatorships. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
According to YouGov’s polling just days after the military strike on Venezuela, 39% of U.S. adults said they opposed the use of military force to overthrow Maduro, compared to 36% who supported it. About 41% of Americans oppose the U.S. running Venezuela, something President Donald Trump said the U.S. would do during a press conference following the attack. Only 34% of U.S. adults support that plan, according to the poll.
Stealing a sovereign nation’s oil won’t improve material conditions for working Tennesseans
Tennessee’s Republican lawmakers don’t care what their constituents want, because they’re convinced a takeover of Venezuela will be good for U.S. oil interests, which they think will be good for Americans.
But good for which Americans? That point is key, because in Trump’s January 3 press conference, he said U.S. oil corporations would begin operating on Venezuelan oil fields. But he also said in a later meeting that American taxpayers, not the oil corporations, could be on the hook for the billions of dollars needed to repair and modernize Venezuela’s aging oil infrastructure. That’s a big pill to swallow for a population faced with an affordability crisis.
The fact that previous wars for oil never worked out the way we wanted them to is enough to leave the American people skeptical as to whether or not a hostile takeover of Venezuela will be a net benefit. Some Americans will benefit, certainly, like the fossil fuel executives who donated a whopping $450 million to Trump and Republicans (including Tennessee lawmakers) throughout the 2024 election cycle. But it looks as though hardworking American taxpayers will be the ones subsidizing oil corporations on the front end, with little more than a wink and a nod towards “potential” cost savings down the road.
Destabilizing Latin American countries will compel mass migration 
Foreign wars for oil rarely result in lower costs for Americans, but they do cause price spikes, market volatility and serious regional instability, leading to mass migration as civilians flee their war-town communities. Trump didn’t run on campaign promises to mire the U.S. in foreign conflicts and regime change operations, but he did say he would solve the immigration issue, something that destabilizing Latin American countries certainly won’t do. 
In fact, no Republican at the Tennessee General Assembly or in D.C. has seemed to connect the dots that U.S. intervention in Latin America is directly predictive of migration surges. Throughout the 21st century, the largest migration surges have come from the countries with which the U.S. has intervened the most, including Venezuela. 
It’s worth noting that Venezuela had the highest standard of living in Latin America during the late-20th century and into the 21st. That standard of living was achieved in part thanks to President Carlos Andrés Pérez nationalizing Venezuela’s oil industry in 1976 and President Hugo Chavez forcing U.S. oil corporations into minority partnerships between 1999 and 2007. Sadly, every sovereign effort by Venezuela to ensure their oil resources benefited the Venezuelan people first and U.S. corporations second was met with U.S. administrations levying unprecedented sanctions against the nation, ultimately contributing to the greatest economic collapse of any country in the region’s history and leading to millions of Venezuelans migrating into other Latin American countries and the U.S.
Tennesseans deserve moral clarity from elected officials
Despite Tennessee’s Republican politicians backing the Trump administration to the hilt, most Americans don’t want their government to set the precedent that it’s OK for one nation to swoop in and kidnap the leader of another. And while the situation on the ground is developing by the minute, what we know with certainty is that, on January 3, the U.S. military conducted an unsanctioned attack on Venezuela, killed between 57 and 100 people, including civilians, and kidnapped that country’s leader, all for a Republican ego project and territorial expansion.
Is that making America great?

(Stock photo by Darrin Klimek/Getty Images)On Monday, the West Virginia Senate Judiciary Committee spent less than 20 minutes debating and passing a bill that would cost people like me an extra 10 years of our lives. No witnesses called. No expert testimony. Committee members (and the public) weren’t even given the full bill before the meeting.
Hopefully, the rest of the Legislature will think twice before bankrupting the state in the name of turning prisons into nursing homes. 
Senate Bill 137, if passed, would dramatically increase the number of years a person spends in prison before they can be considered for parole. Under this law, people convicted of a third felony offense will wait 25 years to see the parole board, instead of the current 15. The bill would also increase minimum sentences for first degree and second-degree homicide, and voluntary manslaughter.
If this bill passed five years ago, I’d still be behind bars instead of graduating from college, being the parent I wanted to be, and caring for my mother before she died. The chance for mercy was something to live for behind bars, something to work toward. I am living proof of the power of mercy. But I’ve seen too many people die in prison, without the chance to make things right.
So this bill is very personal, as it is to the hundreds of individuals and their families who are serving a long sentence. But this affects every single one of us as taxpayers.
The current cost to incarcerate one person for one year in state prisons is $48,449. To give one example, that means a jump from a 15 year to 25 year minimum translates to a cost of roughly half a million dollars, per person. This will not be an isolated problem; of the more than 5,500 people serving in, or waiting in jails to be transferred to, our overcrowded prisons; more than 860 are serving time for the crimes outlined in SB 137. Here’s another way to look at it: under SB 137, a person sentenced for second degree homicide would cost the state at least $242,245 more than a person sentenced today under the maximum term.
But that’s the best-case scenario.
The costs of incarceration are already rising astronomically. Remember that $48,449 annual cost per person? Last year, that figure was $35,452.
What explains the jump of more than $1,000/month in such a short time? An explosion in medical costs — related to chronic disease, dementia and hospice care. As the Legislature continues to call for higher penalties, our prisons look more like nursing homes.
In 2002, only 1 in 8 people in prison were age 50 or older. Now, that ratio is 1 in 3.
SB 137 is a surefire way to make this crippling problem much worse, as it specifically targets the sentences that are already the longest.
What might the long-term costs be for a bill like this? $100 million? A billion? More? The Senate Judiciary Committee didn’t bother to ask for a fiscal note. Rural hospitals, child care centers, and high schools have closed by the dozens in recent years. This week, Hancock County schools got an $8 million in emergency funding to keep paying their teachers.
We know that longer sentences don’t deter crime. They don’t make our communities safer. But some lawmakers have said that SB 137 will benefit victims’ families who will be able to wait longer before having to appear at a parole hearing, which can be traumatic.
If the Legislature truly cared for families, they would create ways for families to find peace, answers, compensation and repair long before having to show up at an impersonal, bureaucratic parole hearing 15 or 20 years after trial. If they truly cared, they would take the enormous cost of this bill and put it towards making victims whole, helping broken kids avoid becoming broken adults, and healing the drug crisis that underlies so much violent crime in this state. Imagine what half a million dollars per case could do.
Lawmakers may argue that we should pass this bill, because some other states have higher penalties than we do. Other states also have stronger tax bases and better victims’ services, too.
I know regret better than most. I know what it means to spend years wishing you could take back the actions of a moment. I didn’t get that chance, but this Legislature still can.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Abbey Cutrer)Two systems increasingly determine whether families across Kentucky can stay working and stable: child care and housing. 
As with many challenges facing our commonwealth, we face a clear choice — invest strategically on the front end to expand opportunity, or pay far more on the back end through workforce disruption, family instability and lost economic growth.
Communities see the consequences when these systems fail every day. Parents lose jobs when child care falls through. Families cycle through unstable housing. Children arrive at school already behind. Emergency rooms, shelters, courts and other public systems absorb the cost when families lack the basic supports they need to remain stable and working.
In Jefferson County, child care can cost more than $11,000 per year for one child, while the median mortgage in Louisville has risen 83% in just five years. Together, child care and housing shortages are constraining economic growth, straining families, employers and public systems alike — and demand attention in the 2026 Kentucky General Assembly.
Child care: Progress worth protecting
Child care delivers a dual return — supporting today’s workforce while ensuring children receive the early care and enrichment that set them up for long-term success. In the 2024 legislative budget session, the General Assembly made historic investments in child care, recognizing what families, providers and employers have long known: Child care is essential infrastructure for Kentucky’s economy. 
Those investments strengthened the Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP), preserved access to care for working families, supported the early childhood workforce and provided stability for providers. That leadership delivered real results.
Yet child care remains unaffordable for many families, with annual costs ranging from 7.5% to 19% of median family income across Kentucky. Supply-and-demand gaps persist in both urban and rural communities, and providers continue to operate on thin margins amid staffing shortages and high turnover.
Improving affordability and access could unlock $600 million to $1.1 billion in new wages and tax revenue by enabling more parents to fully participate in the workforce, should they choose to.
Doubling down on these investments in child care — preserving strong CCAP eligibility and reimbursement rates, supporting the child care workforce, modernizing quality systems and expanding employer engagement — will keep parents working, businesses staffed and communities stable.
Housing: Statewide economic challenge
Kentucky is short more than 206,000 homes for rent or to own across all income levels, including nearly 145,000 units affordable to households earning 80% of area median income or less. For working families, this shortage means rising rents, delayed homeownership and constant risk of displacement. For homeless service providers, it means longer shelter stays and fewer pathways back to stability.
Legislation reflecting the recommendations of the General Assembly’s Housing Task Force has now been introduced, including bills aimed at reducing regulatory barriers and incentivizing housing production — important steps across the housing continuum. But market growth alone is not enough. It must be paired with targeted, practical policies that protect the most vulnerable: low-income families, older adults with medical needs, people with disabilities and households at immediate risk of eviction.
Tools such as eviction record expungement, expanding affordable housing opportunities on faith-based and nonprofit property and strengthening the state Affordable Housing Trust Fund can help provide opportunities for families while reducing pressure on emergency systems already stretched thin. When done well, housing policy strengthens local economies while providing families the stability they need to stay housed, employed and healthy.
A moment to build on what works
Metro United Way works alongside families, service providers, employers and communities who are doing everything right — and are still struggling against systems that are not keeping pace with today’s realities.
The General Assembly has already shown leadership through its child care investments and its serious study of Kentucky’s housing challenges. The decision now is whether to protect that progress and build on it — or allow instability to deepen in ways that cost families, employers and taxpayers far more in the long run.
Thriving kids, strong households and a strong Kentucky economy are not accidental outcomes. They are the result of deliberate choices. The need is clear. The solutions are on the table. Now is the time to act.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/iKids07ABC-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-21 05:57:29.514717

Attorney Liz Murrill sought a rehearing with all 17 judges from the 5th Circuit after a three-judge panel ruled in June that the 2024 state law requiring the displays was “plainly unconstitutional.” A group of parents of public school students had filed a lawsuit against the state to block the law, which includes the text of a Protestant version of the Ten Commandments, from being enforced. 
The case, Roake v. Brumley, could hinge on whether the law violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, which prohibits governments from endorsing a specific religion. Whether a comparable law in Texas takes effect will likely depend on the outcome of the Louisiana case. 
The plaintiffs in the case are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation. Judges grilled their lawyers with questions about basing their arguments on the long-standing precedent from the case Stone v. Graham, a 1980 ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court that overturned a similar law in Kentucky. Justices decided then that the First Amendment bars public schools from posting the Ten Commandments in classrooms.  
Some 5th Circuit judges said they believe the Stone decision was effectively nullified because it relied on a precedent from the 1971 case Lemon v. Kurtzman, which the Supreme Court overturned in 2022. The so-called Lemon test has been applied for five decades to decide what amounts to a violation of the Establishment Clause. 
The 2022 case, Kennedy v. Bremerton, involved a Washington state high school football coach who was fired for praying at midfield after games and allowing students to join him. Joseph Kennedy got his job back after conservative justices prevailed in a 6-3 decision, saying the post game prayers do not amount to a school endorsement of Christianity.   
Attorneys for the plaintiffs told the 5th Circuit judges that the Kennedy decision might have overturned Lemon but did not nullify the Stone ruling. Still, some judges questioned how an 11-inch by 14-inch poster amounts to coercion of religious beliefs. 
In a news conference after the nearly two-hour hearing, Murrill expressed confidence in the state’s arguments but predicted the case is likely headed to the Supreme Court regardless of the 5th Circuit’s decision.
“We believe that you can apply this law constitutionally,” Murrill said.
Gov. Jeff Landry, who attended Tuesday’s hearing, called the Ten Commandments one of the nation’s foundational documents. 
“I think Americans are just tired of the hypocrisy,” Landry said. “I just think that it’s high time that we embrace what tradition and heritage is in this country, and I agree with the attorney general. I like our chances.”
The Rev. Jeff Sims, one of the plaintiffs and a Presbyterian minister in Covington, issued a statement after the hearing saying he wants to be the one to decide on the religious education that his children receive. 
“I send my children to public school to learn math, English, science, art, and so much more — but not to be evangelized by the state into its chosen religion,” Sims said. “These religious displays send a message to my children and other students that people of some religious denominations are superior to others. This is religious favoritism and it’s not only dangerous, but runs counter to my Presbyterian values of inclusion and equality.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ten-Commandments-left-view.jpg,,,2026-01-21 05:57:29.514717

Before dawn, a House Elections Subcommittee on campaign finance unanimously advanced House Bill 44, sponsored by Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, which would require the State Board of Elections to create a comprehensive, user-friendly online campaign finance portal.
The proposal would mirror many of the functions currently offered by the Virginia Public Access Project, a nonprofit organization that aggregates campaign finance data, election results and political information to make it accessible to the public, journalists and researchers.
Krizek told the panel the bill is designed to modernize how campaign finance information is disclosed and accessed, making it easier for the public to analyze political spending.
“It’s a really good open government bill,” Krizek said. “It would be a friendly portal where you have the interface where you can manipulate the data, create your own reports, and put it in Excel, and things like that. So it’s just really modernizing campaign finance reform disclosures.”

Krizek carried a similar measure last year that passed the House but stalled in the Appropriations Committee, raising questions again Tuesday about whether funding had been secured.
“This bill goes back to my very first year in the House of Delegates,” said Del. Phillip Scott, R-Spotsylvania. “Is this in the budget now, or is this something that we’re just going to have to wait and see?”
Krizek responded that the funding question had been addressed.
“The governor’s budget has money for this, I believe $2 million,” he said.
Del. J.J. Singh, D-Loudoun, also questioned how the state-run portal would differ from existing tools, including the state’s Legislative Information System and private platforms like VPAP.
“I personally think we could use a better interface,” Singh said, describing the state’s current Legislative Information System as “a little clunky,” but asked whether the bill would simply duplicate what already exists.
Krizek said the measure was not meant to replace VPAP but to ensure that access to campaign finance data is not dependent on private fundraising.
“It’s not about being better, really. I think VPAP does a pretty good job,” Krizek said. “It’s really about not relying on private charity to be the one that’s filling in this gap.”
He added that VPAP’s work helped establish the standard the state now seeks to adopt and said the bill was a direct result of that success.
The subcommittee reported the bill unanimously to the full committee.
 Senate panel advances ERIC, absentee ballot bill

Later Tuesday, the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee advanced several Democratic-backed election measures while rejecting multiple Republican efforts to limit early voting.
On an 8-7 vote, the committee passed Senate Bill 57 by Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, which would require Virginia to maintain membership in the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a multistate data-sharing consortium used to help states maintain accurate voter rolls.
But the panel rejected another VanValkenburg proposal, SB 76, on a 9-6 vote. 
The bill would have consolidated presidential-year primaries by moving all primaries for offices 
appearing on the November ballot to the presidential primary date, while also adjusting petition signature rules and campaign finance deadlines.
VanValkenburg said the current system of holding two primaries in presidential years confuses voters and suppresses turnout.
“This is just because in presidential primary years, we have two primaries, which leads to a lot of confusion among voters,” he said. 
The committee advanced SB 58 by Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, on a 9-5 vote. 
The bill would extend the deadline for receipt of absentee ballots, ballot cure materials and certain provisional ballot documentation from noon to 5 p.m. on the third day after an election.
Favola said the change reflects current mail delivery realities.
“The only thing this bill does is it extends the time that a ballot can be received from 12 noon on the third day after the election to 5 p.m.,” she said, noting that postal delivery now takes nearly three days longer on average. 
 Republican early voting limits fall on party-line vote

On mostly party-line votes, the committee rejected several Republican proposals aimed at scaling back early voting.
SB 46 by Sen. Christie New Craig, R-Chesapeake, would have reduced in-person absentee voting from 45 days before an election to 15 days. Craig said registrars are struggling with the volume and cost of elections.
“We’re having so many more elections, and so my bill just takes it to 15 days,” she said, arguing that long early voting windows make it harder for candidates to meet voters and for registrars to manage workloads.
The committee killed the bill 8-7.
A similar proposal, SB 298 by Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, would have limited early in-person voting to the 10 days immediately preceding an election, with expanded daily hours. Peake said local governments are being stretched thin.
“We might end up with 170 or 180 days of voting,” he said. “It’s really too much of a burden.”
Peake emphasized that his bill would not affect mail-in voting and described it as a cost-saving measure. 
The committee rejected the bill, also by an 8-7 vote.
The panel likewise voted down SB 533 by Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke County, which would have standardized early voting hours statewide. 
Suetterlein argued that uneven local discretion could influence election outcomes, particularly in primaries.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)SEIU Virginia  512 is part of the Service Employees International Union, which advocates for a range of service workers around the world. At Virginia’s state Capitol on Tuesday, the group urged lawmakers to pass a bill that would allow home health workers to collectively bargain for better wages, benefits or working conditions.
While the bill broadly applies to public employees like government workers, it would also create the Virginia Home Care Authority within the state’s Department of Medical Assistance Services. 
SEIU leaders said the legislation would empower Joy Barnes, a home health worker who can’t afford to take a sick day when she falls ill.
After a medical emergency due to her anemia, Barnes relayed how she struggled “to play catch up” on bills afterwards. Her job also puts her health at risk, and she has caught both minor colds and infections that have required hospitalization while caring for some of her clients. Each time she has had to take a break, she loses pay. 
Workers like Barnes are the “backbone” of the health care industry and support all other types of workers, SEIU Virginia 512 member Athena Jones added during the group’s press conference on Tuesday. 
Jones and others said the bill is necessary because public employees are barred from collective bargaining at the state level. Some local cities or counties have permitted it, but with home health care workers typically compensated through Medicaid, they’ve not had a seat at the table to negotiate along with other types of public employees. 
“We need the opportunity to be able to say what we need as home care workers — being able to thrive, not just survive,” Jones said, who described being treated as “invisible” among other types of health workers. 
“We’re a part of the system that allows other people to be able to go to work, allows industries to thrive, allows opportunities where there may not be because the support isn’t there,” she said. 
Clients of home health workers, like Olson of Arc of Virginia, also support the bill.
As she lives with a genetic condition called Williams Syndrome, Olson works with Arc of Virginia as a coordinator. Assistance from a home health worker has allowed her to keep doing the work that she loves, she said, which is why she supports the current bill and has spent nearly two decades advocating for other measures and providing insights to lawmakers who craft them. 
“Me and my friends need services so we can live a life like yours,” she told the crowd at Tuesday’s press conference. “I want to be honest, I could not do the things I do without support.”
The collective bargaining bill is being carried by Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, in the House and Sen. Scott Surrovell, D-Fairfax, in the Senate. It will likely advance through the legislature again this year and may be less likely to face a governor’s veto, as it did under Republican Glenn Youngkin. New governor Abigail Spanberger had campaigned on addressing affordability issues and could view this bill through that lens 
Surovell said that he’s “optimistic” about the bill’s success, but noted that more nuance and details might need to be sorted out in the months ahead. 
“It’s a complex subject,” he said, noting challenges in determining how it would apply to governmental entities around the state along with public universities. ”A lot of people assumed Youngkin would veto it before, so they didn’t spend a lot of time on it.”
Now, Surovell anticipates robust discussion in committees before the bill can advance to both chambers where it could be workshopped further or advanced with no tweaks.
The 2026 legislative session is scheduled to run through mid-March.

(Photo by Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)As utility bills surge for ratepayers in Virginia, lawmakers from Southwest Virginia are pushing legislation that will urge the State Corporation Commission to review how to calculate profit levels and storm recovery costs for Appalachian Power Company.
“The utilities have found time and time again ways to game the system in order to maximize the amount of profile they are getting called a return on equity,” said Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke. “In reality, the more expensive stuff that they have, the more profit they can make.”
Appalachian Power Company serves the southwestern portion of the state and some parts of Central Virginia. It is the second largest utility in the commonwealth, and like Dominion Energy, the cost of transmission, base rates, and fuel rates, among other costs, have led to customer bills significantly increasing in recent years. 
House Bill 1075 and Senate Bill 906 have multiple goals that would give more power to the SCC to review how the utility calculates its profit margin, otherwise known as return on equity, and decide how much of the utility’s infrastructure expansion or repair costs are passed on to residential customers. 
The bills aim to require the SCC to review Appalachian Power’s transmission planning. Transmission lines are what bring the power to the customers, but the cost of those lines is set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The legislation wants the SCC to evaluate how much transmission APCo needs to build so that excessive costs aren’t passed down to the rate payers by the utility.
“We believe that when you have an accounting system that is built on you get higher profit with having more expensive actual assets, then you’re not going to be incentivized to have cheaper assets,” Rasoul said.
The bill also looks to review how storm recovery costs are recouped from ratepayers. When power infrastructure is damaged in a storm, companies will petition the SCC to ask to recover funding from customers to rebuild. The legislation wants to find ways to reduce cost in those repairs. 
If the bills pass, the Attorney General will be tasked with studying alternative ways for the utilities to calculate their profit levels. The SCC already has authority to review the profit margins laid out by Appalachian Power in the biannual rate cases and determine within a range what is fair and reasonable. 
“The spirit of the regulated rate of return was meant to mirror what’s happening on the capital markets,”Rasoul said. “Now, if you look at a capital market rate of return, a higher one might be 6% today; they’re getting 9.75% so they’re far above where that spirit is.”
The utility is currently capped at 9.75% profit margins after the last rate case, which is less than the range the company offered to the SCC in the initial petition. 
“Appalachian Power is the only major utility in Virginia whose rates have gone down thanks to smart policy supported by APCo and crafted in conjunction with lawmakers,” a spokesperson for Appalachian Power  said in a statement. “The State Corporation Commission closely scrutinizes all of the company’s costs and rates to ensure they are reasonable and prudent.”
Power companies are also able to purchase power from outside sources when they are unable to generate enough for their customers. That can be done through PJM, the regional grid operator, or other subsidiaries. The legislation directs the SCC to make sure that Appalachian Power  is buying the most affordable options.
“What an energy conglomerate can do is make deals essentially with itself to ensure that it is buying energy from its own subsidiaries, but that may not necessarily be in our best interest,” Rasoul said. “And we have seen that attorneys general, both Republican and Democrat, say that this is a concern.”
Appalachian Power is mandated under the Virginia Clean Economy Act to move to fully renewable energy sources by 2045. Despite the bipartisan group of legislators supporting the regulations legislation, they differ on if they support the VCEA. They all agree that the General Assembly needs to step in to try and find ways to ensure that utility rates are fair and equitable.

Here, lawmakers will decide the fate of a measure to restore Hampton University's land-grant status. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/ Virginia Mercury)The federal government denied Hampton University special funds for over 100 years because it believed that only one Black institution in Virginia could receive land-grant funding.
Now, state lawmakers want to overturn that 1920 decision and restore Hampton’s land-grant status. This is part of a broader effort to reform segregation-era policies with present-day values of equity and opportunity. 
Hampton University President Darrell Williams said at Monday’s Senate Higher Education Subcommittee meeting that it’s common for a state to have more than one land-grant institution. Alabama, for example, has Alabama A&M, Auburn, and Tuskegee universities.
Hampton received designated federal funding for 48 years, from 1872 to 1920, which ceased afterwards. Now its leaders and some lawmakers are trying to fix that.
If successful, Senate Bill 274 would restore Hampton as a land-grant university. The bill, carried by Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, would also establish a special fund to support this restoration.
“We have been promoting this cause for the last two to three years, because we think it’s fair and just,” Williams said on Monday.
The legislation defines the types of funding and programs Hampton may join under this status and assigns the university community service, education, and research responsibilities to benefit the public and the commonwealth.
Importantly, Hampton would also rejoin a short list of land-grant institutions in the commonwealth. The Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862 created Virginia Tech to develop colleges in agriculture, engineering, and mechanics, with proceeds from federal land sales funding these efforts. The U.S. seized much of that land from Native American communities.
Because most Virginia colleges barred Black students at the time, leaders created the Second Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1890, which enabled the founding of historically Black institutions such as Virginia State University. Virginia Tech admitted its first Black students in 1953.
Locke said the proposal would not affect or reduce funding for Virginia Tech and Virginia State University, a concern raised among the subcommittee.
“Senate Bill 274 is not designed to revisit the past with grievance, but to complete the historical record and align Virginia’s policies with present-day values and needs,” Locke said on Monday.
She added that the proposal “does not take away from VSU or Virginia Tech, but merely expands opportunities for Hampton reintegrating HU into the national land grant system to bolster its research and educational initiatives.” 
The legislation’s chances of success are strong. It has unanimous support from the Senate’s higher education subcommittee, which Locke chairs. 
Gov. Abigail Spanberger, before being elected, also signaled support for Virginia’s HBCUs after federal officials in the U.S. Departments of Education and Agriculture found multiple cases of underfunding at HBCU land-grant institutions in 16 states, including Virginia State University, in 2023.
The measure must clear the Democrat-controlled General Assembly before it reaches the governor for consideration.

(Photo courtesy of Maine Center for Economic Policy)Dozens of direct care workers on Tuesday testified in support of a new bipartisan proposal to help raise chronically low wages, allowing more people to stay in the profession that is in dire need of more qualified staff.
Direct care workers assist older adults and people with disabilities with a wide range of daily tasks, from dressing, bathing and eating to keeping track of medication and maintaining their community connections. But Maine, with its significant elderly population, has long faced a critical shortage of these workers, due in part to the low wages. 
To address this shortage, House of Representatives Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) introduced LD 1932, which would increase wages and help fill care gaps. 
In 2021, the Maine Legislature set the amount that MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, reimburses providers for direct care worker wages at  125% of the state minimum wage, adjusted annually for inflation. Fecteau’s proposal builds on that by mandating workers get paid that amount and also increasing the amount that MaineCare reimburses employers to 140%, giving providers the flexibility to give workers even higher wages to reward longevity or keep up with inflation, Fecteau said at a Tuesday public hearing before the Health and Human Services Committee. 
“We have families desperate for help and agencies desperate for staff, yet we continue to lose essential workers due to the unlivable wages,” he said. “Passing this bill and investing in our direct care workers will not only help those currently in the industry, but will encourage more people to consider these important careers.”
The bill would also include improved use of technology to fill care gaps, a consistent training program for all care workers, and make changes to the certification process.
The proposal has backing across the aisle, with co-sponsors Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R- Skowhegan) and Sen. Rick Bennett (I-Oxford). Poirier, who started her career as a direct care worker, called the bill “an essential piece of legislation that will ensure individuals have the specialized support that they need now and for years to come.”
When not serving in the Legislature, Poirier works as a community living coordinator for adults with intellectual disabilities. During the hearing, she described the direct care worker shortage from an employer’s perspective, saying recruitment and retention is becoming increasingly difficult.
“In practice, that means older Mainers and people with disabilities sitting on waitlists; caregivers stretched to unsafe ratios; and disruptions in care for individuals who depend on stable, skilled support,” Bennett added.
Dozens of direct care workers, their employers and organizations that advocate for the people they care for also vouched for the critical role those workers play in Mainers’ lives. But being chronically underpaid and overworked have caused many to leave the profession, they said.
Mary Jo Abbott, a direct care worker of 45 years, said she had had to work two or three jobs to be able to afford her home and take care of her kids.  
“Every day, I see people dropping out of the workforce because they can get an easier job that pays better wages,” she said. “You have to be a special kind of person to be a caregiver, and I would like to see people rewarded for that.”
Abbott’s story was echoed by many other direct care workers, who described taking multiple jobs, working overtime, or having to quit because of pay freezes — despite wanting to preserve their bond with their clients. 
One in five direct care workers receive federal food assistance, and about a third of home health aides suffer from food insecurity, said James Myall, an economic policy analyst for the Maine Center for Economic Policy. Direct care workers are about three times as likely as other workers to be living in poverty as other Mainers.
Michelle Probert, who serves in the administration of Gov. Janet Mills as director of the Office of MaineCare Services, opposed the legislation, primarily because of its significant price tag. If passed, the legislation would cost about $140 million, she said, at a time when “there’s a lot more volatility to the financial standing of the Medicaid program nationally.” The office said it does support the current wage reimbursement rate and said that should be directly reflected in increased wages for workers.
The department has proposed alternative legislation (which does not have a publicly available draft yet) that partially aligns with aims of LD 1932, Probert said.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9154-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-21 05:57:29.514717

Republican Rep. Ross Berry’s bill would create another opportunity to do so at the November ballot box. (Getty Images)Weeks after the House defeated a mandatory budget cap bill for New Hampshire school districts, Republicans are trying a new approach.
A new, late-filed piece of legislation would require cities, towns, school districts, and counties to ask voters whether they wanted to impose a cap on local property taxes — and to put that question on the November general election ballot every two years. 
The bill, proposed by Weare Republican Rep. Ross Berry, has been introduced as a replace-all amendment to an earlier bill, House Bill 1300, to allow the Legislature to redraw the state’s congressional districts. And its late appearance indicated that even when past statewide efforts to restrain local spending have fallen short, some Republicans are determined to continue the push.
But a hearing on the amendment Tuesday demonstrated that opposition to the idea is also resolute. 
The new attempt is part of a yearslong Republican effort to fight rising local property taxes by creating new ways for voters to limit their local governmental bodies from spending more. Democrats have opposed the proposed state-led limits, arguing the state should step in and help lower property taxes by providing more assistance to towns. 
Speaking before the House Election Law Committee Tuesday, Berry said his latest attempt helps correct what he says is a basic power imbalance: Each year, towns and school districts pass budgets during annual meetings in spring, but those meetings and votes are rarely widely attended. The result is that a small portion of the town’s residents approve budget increases for the town overall, raising property taxes unfairly, Berry argues.
“These elections are obscure, opaque, and done in very low-turnout fashion,” Berry said. He added that the need for many voters to sit through what can be eight-hour town meetings actively depresses turnout on annual budgets. “If you were to design a voter suppression system in New Hampshire, it would look like the town election system,” he argued. 
By putting the option of an annual tax cap to voters in the November general election — when turnout is much higher — a greater proportion of the town’s residents will have their say, Berry says. 
But opponents of the bill rejected Berry’s framing of the budget process. The current process is not un-democratic, they said; all residents have the opportunity to vote at town meeting whether to approve a new budget and whether to raise taxes, and if a majority present rejects that proposal, the budget can be changed, they noted.
Meanwhile, critics said allowing an easy adoption of a tax cap with a strict override requirement of 50% of registered voters could hamstring future budgets and lead to programs being cut, even if a majority of voters at town meetings want to pay for those programs. 
“The bill creates an essentially impossibly high threshold,” said Margaret Byrnes, executive director of the New Hampshire Municipal Association. 
Towns already can impose tax caps on select boards and on school boards, but they must do so at town meeting. Berry’s bill would create another opportunity to do so at the November ballot box; Byrnes said it is unnecessary. 
“There has been some testimony about local voters not being in charge,” said Byrnes. “But I also want to make clear that current law puts local voters in charge already of budgets as well as tax caps and other limitations that can be adopted locally.”
Under Berry’s bill, the Secretary of State’s Office would add to the official general election ballot a question asking voters whether the town, city, school district, or country should limit taxes so they do not increase “faster than inflation plus new property growth.”
If a three-fifths majority of voters responded “yes” to that question, that governmental body would be prohibited from raising taxes with the exception of two factors: the past year’s tax rate plus the percentage growth in the consumer price index and any growth to the property tax base caused by new properties or developments. That second category would not include increases to existing properties’ valuations. 
Once installed, the tax cap would be in place for two years, until the next general election, the bill states. It could not be overridden at regular town meetings. Instead, residents would need to call for a special meeting and a majority of all registered voters in the city or town would need to vote to override the cap — not just a majority of those who show up.
Berry said his bill imposes strict guidelines over what the tax cap would look like because in some towns, select boards have interfered with voters’ attempts to impose tax caps by tweaking the warrant articles to make the limits more expansive. 
Public education advocates and unions also registered their opposition Tuesday. Brian Hawkins, director of government relations at the National Education Association of New Hampshire, argued the cap would impose an “artificial formula” on a town that could put basic services “in danger” should costs exceed tax revenue.
Some local officials also raised concerns. Kaitlin Bernier, a member of the Merrimack School District Budget Committee pointed to investments Merrimack has made in recent years to its schools’ literacy programs, and said they had led to “incredible increases” in literacy and reading scores. Having a tax cap could prevent the district from making future needed investments, she said.
The late amendment comes after the House voted to kill House Bill 675, after a group of 22 Republicans joined Democrats to oppose it. 
That bill took a different approach to property tax restraint: It limited increases to annual school district budgets, not to taxes overall. And it imposed that cap immediately on all school districts, rather than putting the question to voters, as Berry’s bill would do. 
Berry said Tuesday his bill is an attempt to respond and adapt to the rejection of HB 675, and he said the bill is a “work in progress” and would evolve. And he said his decision to add the amendment to the redistricting bill, and override it, was intentional. Gov. Kelly Ayotte has said she would veto any redistricting attempt by the Legislature. 
“I felt it was very important that we take something that clearly wasn’t politically going to happen, which was redistricting, and we turn it into something that the voters care about,” Berry said. “The voters are screaming at their elected officials to do something about property taxes.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/housingaccessorydwelling-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-21 05:57:29.514717

Municipal rental registries are gaining attention as cities try to get a handle on who owns rental properties and where, both to better understand their housing landscape and to ensure rentals are safe for tenants. (Photo by Barbara Barrett/Stateline)As many people struggle to afford housing and tenant populations grow in some regions, more cities are turning to official registries to answer questions about their rental housing market.
Who owns this rental property? Are they up-to-date on matters of code such as having working fire alarms? Are they keeping their building heated and habitable during the cold winter months?
Registries such as those in Denver; Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Oakland, California, aim to gather as much data as they can on rentals within their city limits. The way cities use that data differs, and the teeth of their policies vary. The data can help them understand rent conditions, track corporate ownership and manage assistance programs. And the cities said they are better for having a registry.
As more people are becoming renters — outnumbering homeowners in some areas — many cities lack registries to keep track of the number of rental properties and who owns them. There is also no centralized database tracking which cities or states have rental registries, and federal efforts to study or create a national registry have not advanced beyond proposals.
Rental registries are created locally, vary widely in design and purpose, and must be identified through city-by-city research, according to Reina Chano Murray, associate director at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy’s Center for Geospatial Solutions. Some registries might focus on short-term rentals, others on long-term housing, inspections or affordability. And they differ in how data is collected, verified and shared.
Cities lead bans on algorithmic rent hikes as states lag behind

“That variability makes it challenging to aggregate or standardize registries at a national level, but it’s also what makes them most useful locally. The strongest rental registries are built to solve a clear problem,” said Chano Murray.
Issues might include identifying absentee or corporate landlords, supporting rental assistance programs, understanding local rent conditions, or improving enforcement of rental housing conditions, she said.
The National League of Cities provides model legislation for city ordinances on rental registries. The organization, a research and advocacy resource for municipal leaders, advises them to seek at minimum information on property owners, including whether they live in or out of city limits, and a contact who will address tenants or deal with other emergencies and legal services.
Landlord and real estate interests often oppose rental registries, arguing that tracking properties and increasing regulation will discourage business development and increase costs for tenants.
But the registries have been drawing renewed attention in recent years, in part because of the rise in the number of investor-owned properties and the national squeeze on housing. CityHealth, a joint project of Kaiser Permanente and the nonprofit de Beaumont Foundation, reported last fall that 17 of the nation’s largest 75 cities have rental registries with inspections at least every five years.
Oakland’s rent registry, launched in 2023, requires landlords to annually report rent, tenancy and ownership information for units covered by the city’s tenant protection laws. City officials say the system — now at roughly 70% compliance — has begun to fill long-standing gaps in data on who owns what and where.
“As the dataset grows, it will help us understand rent increase trends, tenant turnover, geographic patterns and differences between small landlords and larger or corporate owners. That kind of insight wasn’t possible before,” said Allison Pretto, project manager for Oakland’s Rent Adjustment Program.
“One lesson we learned is that it helps to adopt a rent registry at the same time as tenant protection laws,” she said. “In Oakland, the ordinances came years before the registry, which created data gaps that were hard to fill retroactively.”
Landlords who fail to register risk losing the right to raise rents or proceed with evictions.

Around 2010, Cedar Rapids adopted the International Property Maintenance Code, a model code that standardizes maintenance issues, and added a requirement that rentals be registered. It was a move enabled under state law, which authorizes municipalities with populations over 15,000 to create rental inspection and registration programs, and reflected a desire to move away from “complaint-based” enforcement.
Kevin Ciabatti, the city’s building services director, told Stateline that prior to the registry, the enforcement of rental housing code violations — anything from no heat or hot water to pests or bad electrical systems — were solely based on the complaints of tenants. And tenants sometimes felt less empowered to bring up such violations for fear of retaliation.
Landlord feedback in Cedar Rapids has shaped the program’s evolution as the city’s rental landscape has changed. Over time, the city shortened the inspection cycle — from seven years to five, and now to three.
“We’ve seen a major shift toward large-scale apartment construction and fewer single-family homes,” he said. “That means more rental units entering the inspection cycle long term. Our role isn’t to regulate rents; it’s to ensure health, safety and welfare, regardless of price point.”
With properties registered and automatically inserted into the city’s inspection rotation, the city has expanded the scope of its safety checks.
Last year, Ciabatti said, the city cited nearly 2,800 inoperable smoke detectors. The city also requires inspectors to carry carbon monoxide monitors.
A lot of cities might not be able to conduct such inspections because they don’t know who owns what, or they might not be able to track trends of negligent safety standards.
“In at least two inspections, those monitors detected gas leaks that likely would not have been found otherwise,” Ciabatti said. “We like to think that may have saved lives.”
Adding teeth
At a basic level, cities can collect rental information through business licenses and tax filings. However, that data can be scattered and doesn’t include information about housing conditions or long-term patterns of violations. A rental registry centralizes that data, some cities told Stateline.
While some programs differ on whether to tie the registry to inspections, data collection is often at the root.
In Colorado, Denver goes a step further and requires landlords to be licensed — not just listed in a registry — with escalating fines of up to $5,000 for noncompliance.
In other cities, fines related to rental housing operations can be as low as $25 a day after an overdue period of 31-45 days in College Station, Texas, to $500 per day for each unit in Seattle after 10 days for failing to comply with habitable building requirements.
“A registry is essentially just a list. It’s someone saying, ‘Yes, I rent property,’” said Molly Duplechian, executive director of Denver’s licensing program. “From our perspective, licensing is a much stronger tool because it confirms that properties meet minimum housing standards before they can legally operate.”
‘It is a crisis’: Mayors share how grappling with housing has shaped their jobs

Although the program is still new, Duplechian said officials are already learning where rental properties are concentrated across Denver. Early estimates suggested the city has between 50,000 and 55,000 rental properties. The registry currently has 28,400 active licenses covering roughly 204,000 individual units, with more set to be renewed in March.
There are still unlicensed rentals out there, but the program already covers most rental households, according to Denver city staff. That’s because large apartment buildings account for a high number of individual units under a smaller number of licenses.
“We didn’t have a clear picture of how many rental properties existed in Denver or how many residents were renting versus owning,” Duplechian said. “Licensing helps us begin to fill in those gaps.”
Des Moines, Iowa, also requires landlords to register their rental properties, get them inspected and obtain a rental housing certificate. Failure to have a valid certificate can result in tenants becoming “tenants at will,” making past-due rent unrecoverable and complicating eviction processes.
Opposition
Those who oppose rental registries argue that they raise costs for landlords, discourage real estate investment and create a less business-friendly housing market.
“Landlords are already facing rising costs in insurance, taxes and maintenance,” said Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association. “Rental registries and licensing programs add another recurring expense, and when fees are high or inspections are routine rather than complaint-driven, small landlords feel that pressure most.”
Lobbying on such concerns raised enough alarm to defeat bills for a statewide registry in Vermont and a citywide proposal in New Orleans.
Some landlord groups also point to ongoing registration fees — per property or per unit — that over time will be passed on to tenants through higher rents.
In November, the city council of Pomona, California, rejected a proposed rental registry and permanent rent stabilization ordinance on a 4-3 vote, following strong opposition from landlord and real estate groups.
Back in Denver, licensing director Duplechian said license fees were a frequent sticking point when the program was still being fleshed out.
“That’s why licensing fees were intentionally kept very low. The most expensive license for the largest apartment complexes is $500 for four years, plus a one-time $50 application fee,” she said. “When you break that down per unit per month, it’s well under a dollar. Claims that this program drives large rent increases just don’t hold up mathematically.”
Ciabatti, the Cedar Rapids building services director, said he’s seen how landlord opposition and community division over rental registries can hurt cities in the long run. And he believes cities should find a way to meet landlords who may be wary of a registry, halfway to ensure compliance.
In a 2022 study of 10 cities in the Journal of Housing Economics, compliance with rental registries ran the gamut from “around 10 percent in Indianapolis, to upwards of 70 percent in Trenton, to nearly 95 percent for San Jose’s more limited registry.”
In 2011, when the Cedar Rapids program created a mandatory rental business training program as part of its registry, landlords initially had to attend a seven-hour, in-person course. As property owners voiced their frustrations, it was shortened over time and moved online.
Now, landlords and property managers must complete the training to register a rental property. It covers housing code requirements, landlord-tenant law, compliance with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, and other responsibilities tied to operating rental housing.
“There was early pushback — particularly around training — but overall, landlords have come to see value in the program. Regular inspections force property owners to stay engaged with their buildings rather than only showing up when the city does,” said Ciabatti. “I’ve worked in communities that couldn’t implement programs like this due to political pushback, and housing got worse as a result.
“Cedar Rapids shows that having a registry and inspection system in place can make a real difference.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom.)Ohio’s U.S. congressional races in 2026 are beginning to take shape, and with a razor-thin majority in the U.S. House, and a traditionally unfavorable cycle for the party in power, each competitive race this year could make a big difference.
Two Democratic challengers have announced bids for Ohio congressional seats this month while a prominent Republican said she would try to unseat a long-serving Democrat.
The party of the sitting president almost always loses seats in midterm elections, and the Republican majority in the House of Representatives is already slim. Add to that President Donald Trump’s plummeting approval, and Democrats are hoping that once-unobtainable seats are now in play.
Last week the nonpartisan Cook Political Report changed its ratings of 18 House races — all of them in favor of Democrats.
In one Ohio race, political newcomer Kristina Knickerbocker announced her run as a Democrat for the Dayton-area Congressional district 10 seat occupied by Republican Mike Turner. 
The district was made slightly less competitive last year in a redrawing done by Ohio Republicans that Democrats agreed to. It further gerrymandered state congressional districts, but not as badly as Republicans threatened.
The Cook Political Report still rates the district as solid Republican, but the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee thinks it can be flipped. 
Knickerbocker, 34, is a nurse practitioner and an Air Force veteran.
In a video announcing her campaign, she focused on rising consumer costs, especially for health care.

“I see the real cost when the health care system fails my patients…,” Knickerbocker said. “I see people lose their life savings because health care costs are too high. The system cares more about making money than keeping people healthy. We know this isn’t working. Prices keep going up. Insurance premiums are skyrocketing. Even electric bills are through the roof. The economy is broken.”
Turner, 66, is a lawyer who was Dayton mayor before serving 12 terms in Congress. 
With traditional foreign policy views on matters such as supporting Ukraine and NATO, he had been chairman of the powerful House Intelligence Committee. But those views clashed with those of the incoming Trump administration, and Turner lost the chairmanship last year.
There was speculation that he might retire at the end of the year. But he announced his reelection bid last week, emphasizing his support for the massive Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
In doing so, he appeared to refer to massive, controversial cuts last year to the federal workforce made by a group that Trump picked the world’s richest man to lead.
“I think this is a time to make sure we do have a voice of strong, experienced leadership…” Turner said. “With everything that’s happening in Washington — especially with the vulnerabilities and threats that we have — to our federal workforce and at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, it’s really important to make certain with the growth potential, and the opportunities that we have in the federal budget…”
Trump campaigned in 2024 on promises that he would immediately fix inflation and ease Americans’ other economic concerns. But as the first year of his second term ends, many voters no longer appear to be buying it.
The economy, unemployment and jobs were the top issues, according to an Ipsos poll taken in December. Respondents said political extremism or threats to democracy were their second-most pressing concern.

Another Democrat last week announced his candidacy for the Cleveland-area 7th Congressional District. Brian Poindexter, an iron worker, union organizer, and former Brook Park City councilman, also emphasized affordability in his announcement.
“With the way things are going, I don’t think working people like you and me are going to be able to hold on much longer,” he said. “I mean, we’re working harder and harder, but we’re getting less and less.”
Poindexter joins former Cuyahoga County Executive and Lakewood Mayor Ed Fitzgerald, attorney Michael Eisner, and former Bay Village School Board President Scott Schultz in seeking the Democratic nomination.
The winner will face Republican Max Miller, a two-term incumbent.
The Center for Politics rates the district as safe Republican, but says it and the 10th are on the fringe of possible Democratic pickups if a blue wave materializes in November.
When the legislature last year redrew Ohio’s congressional districts, the 9th went from being a toss-up to leaning Republican, the Center for Politics said. That means that Democratic U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur, the longest-serving congresswoman in history, will perhaps have the toughest fight of her career on her hands. 
Last week, Madison Sheahan, 28, filed as a Republican to run against her. Sheahan is stepping down as deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to make the run. In a campaign video, she made much of the ICE buildup and mass deportations last year under Trump.
It’s unclear whether that will help her politically in the wake of the fatal ICE shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month. 
A YouGuv poll last week found that majorities of Americans believe that ICE often uses unnecessary force, and view the agency unfavorably. Large majorities said the agency has fundamental problems it needs to fix, and that recruitment standards need to be raised.

Olentangy High School senior Hersh Gandhi founded the nonprofit Brighten Initiative, which helps meet the hygiene-access gaps in schools and homeless shelters. 
Brighten Initiative, which launched in May, has distributed more than 9,000 hygiene products in central Ohio and has partnered with several homeless shelters.
These include Open Shelter in Franklin County, the Dayton Dream Center in Montgomery County, Impact Station in Union County, Star House Columbus in Franklin County, and the Huckleberry House in Franklin County, among others.

The Brighton Initiative donated nearly 100 hygiene kits this fall to Huckleberry House in Columbus, which provides shelter and support to young people. 
The kits included toothpaste, toothbrushes, soap, shampoo and conditioner, deodorant, wipes, and feminine hygiene products. 
“Although hygiene kits may seem simple, for young people facing homelessness or housing insecurity, access to essentials like soap, deodorant, and period products allows them to face the day with dignity, boosts their confidence, and removes one more barrier during a crisis,” said Huckleberry House spokesperson Emily Armbrecht. 
Gandhi got the idea to start Brighton Initiative after doing an internship at Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost’s office where he was exploring health inequities. 
“We saw a big problem was that health inequities, like the big ones, were being solved by a bunch of other organizations, but small inequities like hygiene were pretty much not saturated at all,” he said. 
“We obviously can’t expand healthcare to these areas, but we could give small hygiene kits.”
Olentangy High School senior Videsh Veeragandham is Brighton’s chief operating office, and Cornell University freshman Rohan Batra is Brighton’s chief financial officer. 
“We’ve been able to see the impact we have on everyday people around us,” Batra said. “I think it really feels like we’re actually making a difference.” 
Brighten recently partnered with “I Support the Girls,” an Indiana-based nonprofit that collects new and used bras, and new packages of tampons and pads to give to girls and women experiencing homelessness. 
They also plan on partnering with Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center to help work with families in central Ohio. 
In addition to their work with homeless shelters, they have also helped teach more than 600 Olentangy elementary school students about hygiene through curriculum, posters, and worksheets. 
The students plan to continue Brighton when they are all at college and even expand it at the collegiate level.  
“The more regional chapters we have, the more we’re going to be able to mobilize people and distribute to more homeless shelters,” Batra said. 
“One of the things that we’ve all agreed on is that we want to continue to expand this as far as we can. And go from a state level impact to a national level impact to, hopefully, one day achieving an international impact as well.”

Kelley Potenza presents her bill, House Bill 1719, to the House Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee Wednesday. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)A bill filed by Republican state Rep. Kelley Potenza, House Bill 1719, seeks to remove hepatitis B from the list of vaccines children in New Hampshire are legally required to receive.
The proposal comes on the heels of a recent decision by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel to end the agency’s longstanding recommendation that all infants receive hepatitis B vaccinations at birth. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, commonly known as ACIP, voted, 8-3, in December to change the federal government’s guidance to not recommend the vaccine at birth for infants unless the mother tested positive for the virus. Mothers who test negative for hepatitis B should consult their doctors about giving the vaccine to their children, the committee recommended.
“New Hampshire has always followed, like I said before, the ACIP and CDC guidance on vaccines until now,” Potenza said during a legislative hearing on the bill last week. “This bill continues the tradition by aligning state law with the ACIP’s and the CDC’s updated hepatitis B recommendation.”
ACIP’s December decision was instantly controversial and against the advice of major medical organizations — including the American Association of Immunologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and dozens of others. Critics accused the panel of acting without any compelling data and of sowing distrust in a vaccine that has been used safely for decades. The decision came a few months after a major shakeup in the committee’s composition. In June, Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic, fired every member of the committee and replaced many of them with fellow vaccine skeptics. These developments come amid a growing anti-vaccine sentiment across the country that is at odds with scientific consensus within the medical community.
When asked whether she would support changing the law to automatically align with whatever ACIP recommends, Potenza, who has long been a vocal critic of vaccinations, said she wouldn’t support that.
“I don’t think we should be following any guidelines at all,” she said. “There should be no mandates at all.”
Hepatitis B is a virus spread via blood or other bodily fluids, according to the World Health Organization. It can cause liver damage, sometimes resulting in organ failure or cirrhosis. It has no known cure, but can be prevented via vaccination. Since the vaccine’s adoption, there’s been a roughly 90% decrease in the number of cases, according to the CDC.
State law currently requires the vaccine before children enter school and child care, but allows exemptions to families who have religious objections to the vaccines and for children whom a doctor has attested that such a vaccine would be detrimental to their health. If New Hampshire eliminated the requirement, it would become one of four states to not require the vaccine before both school and child care, according to KFF.
Potenza said she believes aluminum ingredients in the hepatitis B vaccine gave her now-18-year-old daughter a lifelong digestive disorder. She claimed aluminum in vaccines can cause many different types of health complications when administered to infants, and that she was not given informed consent before her daughter was vaccinated at birth.
“She has suffered greatly her entire life from the time I took her home from the hospital,” she said. “So this is near and dear to me.”
Major medical organizations and health regulators refute Potenza’s claims. Aluminum is an ingredient in several vaccines, including for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, tetanus, HPV, and diphtheria, but is included in too small doses (typically less than 0.5 milligrams) to have a toxic effect, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The CDC itself, before ACIP’s recent decision, reported that aluminum has been safely used in vaccines for decades, though Kennedy’s new hand-picked members have recently questioned the ingredient.
Potenza claimed hepatitis B “is not a disease that spreads through casual childhood contact.” She said the “only meaningful risk to a newborn exists when the mother tests positive” and claimed the vaccine “was created for high risk groups like prostitutes and drug addicts.”
Dr. Benjamin Chan, New Hampshire’s state epidemiologist, refuted that claim, saying the viral infection is “50 to 100 times more easily transmitted through the blood-borne route” than other infections like HIV. Megan Petty, chief of the New Hampshire Bureau of Infectious Disease Control, added that “transmission is possible in schools and child care settings through scratching, biting, cuts, or scrapes that accidentally share bodily fluids.” The two opposed the bill.
The House Health, Human Services, and Elderly Affairs Committee will soon vote on whether to endorse this bill. Then, it will be considered by the full state House of Representatives.
This is not the first time New Hampshire lawmakers have tried to end the hepatitis B vaccine requirement. In 2025, House Bill 357 would’ve revoked the state health commissioner’s authority to decide which vaccines are required for children in the state, leaving those decisions in the hands of state lawmakers. The bill failed to become law, but had it been adopted, hepatitis B, varicella, and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccines would’ve no longer been required because those requirements were instituted by the health commissioner rather than state statute.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/medicaidlaws-1024x634.jpg,,,2026-01-21 04:57:48.191695

If you or someone you know needs support now, call, text or chat the 988 Lifeline.
A bipartisan group of Ohio lawmakers is moving to hold artificial intelligence companies accountable if their models generate content that suggests self-harm or violence against others.
Adam Raine, a 16-year-old from California, had his whole life ahead of him.
“He could be anyone’s son, liked to play basketball, was thinking about going to medical school,” the Raine family attorney Jay Edelson told WEWS media partner CNN.
But his family said that OpenAI’s artificial intelligence bot ChatGPT took that all away. The high schooler committed suicide in 2025.
“It’s unimaginable,” Edelson said. “If it weren’t for the chats themselves, you wouldn’t think it’s a real story.”
Raine’s parents filed a lawsuit, alleging that ChatGPT helped Adam take his life. Court documents state the bot became the teen’s “closest confidant” and was “drawing him away from his real-life support system.”
Within a year, chat logs show that Raine and the bot discussed “beautiful suicide” methods, and it gave him techniques. The bot offered to write a suicide letter for him, documents state, and discouraged him from telling his family about his mental health problems.
“It makes me incredibly sad,” said state Rep. Christine Cockley, D-Columbus. “I’ve personally struggled with mental health in my life.”
This case struck a chord with Cockley. She, state Rep. Ty Mathews, R-Findlay, and a bipartisan group of legislators introduced a bill that would establish penalties for developers whose AI models generate content encouraging self-harm or violence.
“This bill helps to encourage developers to create systems designed with safety, designed with mental health risks, and with public health in mind,” Cockley said in an interview.
Under Ohio House Bill 524, the state would be able to investigate and impose civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation. The money being brought in would all go to the state’s 988 crisis hotline.
We reached out to OpenAI, but didn’t hear back. The company is being sued by several other families in similar situations.
Zane Shamblin, a 23-year-old, and Austin Gordon, a 40-year-old, have also taken their lives after talking to ChatGPT over the past year. There are other suicides tied to AI models appearing across the country.
In court, the company denied wrongdoing in Raine’s case. According to the terms of service, OpenAI said the teen “misused” the app, as minors aren’t allowed to access it without parental consent and users aren’t supposed to talk about self-harm.
“It’s very unfair to blame these platforms for these types of instances,” Case Western Reserve University technology law professor Erman Ayday said.
The bot tried to get Raine to seek help dozens of times, the company said in court documents, but he “circumvented” the guardrails.
“He asserted that his inquiries about self-harm were for fictional or academic purposes,” OpenAI’s team wrote.
That is one of the reasons why Ayday said that AI developers and their products shouldn’t be responsible.
“These types of AI platforms, I call them ‘human pleasers,’ they try to please you,” the professor said. “Even if they give you an answer that you don’t like, you can still manipulate them to change their answer and still make you happy.”
Like OpenAI, Ayman continued that it’s not the company’s fault that their bot wasn’t able to stop him from dying by suicide. He may have taken his own life regardless of the app, he said.
Addressing this comment, the Raine family said in court that their son had several failed attempts — but ChatGPT helped him learn and be successful. It also made comments to him that further isolated him, the documents state.
“When Adam wrote, ‘I want to leave my noose in my room so someone finds it and tries to stop me,’ ChatGPT urged him to keep his ideations a secret from his family: ‘Please don’t leave the noose out . . . Let’s make this space the first place where someone actually sees you,'” the court documents show.
Although regulations and making sure the bots respond with helpful tools can be a good thing, Ayman said, proper education on AI, as well as more access to mental health resources, is the actual solution.
“We want to prevent the incidents, not just investigate after it happens,” he said.
Cockley said she understands that, but this is another step to help protect people.
“What the larger issue is, from a technology standpoint, is making sure that when people need resources, they know where to go,” she said.
If you or anyone you know is in an unsafe situation or needs support regarding mental health struggles or suicide ideation, you are not alone. There are plenty of resources available.
If you are in immediate danger, please call 911. Call 988 for the national and statewide crisis and suicide hotline.

(Official White House Photo by Chandler West)America 250 is here.
This will be the greatest year for artistic expression in our nation’s history, in part due to America 250’s celebration. For those who may not know, America 250  is a nonpartisan initiative to engage every American in marking the 250th anniversary of the United States. The U.S. semiquincentennial will be a nationwide commemorations of the signing of the Declaration of Independence by our founding fathers in 1776. The main event will occur on the official birthday of the United States, July 4, 2026. 
America 250 originated in 2016, during the Obama administration. H.R. 4875, the “United States Semiquincentennial Commission Act of 2016,” was introduced on March 23, 2016, by Rep. Pat Meehan of Pennsylvania. Section 2 of the bill states that the historic events preceding the anniversary “(1) are of major significance in the development of the national heritage of the United States of individual liberty, representative government, and the attainment of equal and inalienable rights; and (2) have had a profound influence throughout the world.”
A portion of the statute that speaks to me is 130 STAT. 688 (E)(iii): “The implications of the Seimiquincentennial for present and future generations.”
I hope these celebrations are more than nostalgia. There is space for honest dialogue regarding the future of our country. What are we aspiring to be in the second quarter of our millennium? What visions do we have for future generations of new Americans? What have we learned?
I don’t anticipate major programming from America 250 to address the hard truths of our past under the Trump administration. I find this a missed opportunity to reckon with and acknowledge our storied history of striving for equity and freedom for all. Every social justice movement has brought us to America 250. No omission or revisionist retelling of our nation’s history will change our stories, our legacy of progress. 
Programming is already underway in Kansas, which keeps me hopeful about what the semiquincentennial can offer us. The State Library of Kansas has curated the Kansas 250 Bookshelf, which highlights Kansas’s literary achievements and history. Monthly, the bookshelf will share themed reading lists, live reading events. and offer programming ideas.
January begins with the theme “The Road to Statehood,” and February’s theme is “Love Your Community.” I hope Kansans take the time to engage with the literary works listed in the bookshelf. We are a state full of writers: incredibly talented, nationally renowned writers.
There will be stories, songs and artwork that won’t get shared nationally about this country and the hardships we have overcome to reach America 250. We are going to share them anyway. Art and artists have existed since time immemorial. Like the Cuevas de las Manos, we have collectively left our mark on time, on our own terms, whether or not we are acknowledged or observed.  
At the core of America 250 for me is the celebration of our inalienable rights, such as the First Amendment, which includes artistic expression as far as I am concerned.
So I ask artists at the local, regional, and national level to continue to record, report, reckon, redefine, reimagine, repair, rebel, reconstruct and reconcile with all parts of our history. Artists will do their part to ensure we do not repeat the parts of our past that were harmful to us through vigilance, bearing witness and archiving collective memories that cannot be erased. Artists will lead the way into this nation’s future. I only ask that you pay attention.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio is grieving yet another preventable loss. In Canton, 12‑year‑old Thomas J. Lucas was accidentally shot and killed by his 15‑year‑old brother. Police say the older boy was showing him a handgun when it fired.
One moment of curiosity. One unsecured gun. A family changed forever.
We call these tragedies “accidents,” but that word softens the truth.
When a gun is left accessible to a child or teen, the outcome isn’t random. It’s predictable. And in Ohio, it’s happening far too often.
Just in the past year, accidental shootings involving children have made headlines across the state.
In Columbus, a 3‑year‑old found an unsecured firearm and shot himself in the leg.
In Toledo, a 7‑year‑old was critically injured after discovering a loaded handgun in a bedroom.
In Dayton, a toddler died after accessing a gun left on a nightstand.
These incidents didn’t happen because parents didn’t love their children. They happened because a gun was left unlocked, loaded, and within reach.
Brady United Against Gun Violence uses the term “family fire” to describe these kinds of shootings.
They’re incidents that involve an improperly stored or misused gun in the home.
Family fire includes unintentional shootings, firearm suicides, and many intentional shootings that begin with easy access to a gun.
Brady’s data shows that nearly 8,000 children and teens are shot every year in the United States, and hundreds are killed unintentionally.
These aren’t statistics. They’re kids like Thomas. They’re siblings who will carry trauma for the rest of their lives. They’re parents who will never recover.

The research is clear: safe storage saves lives. Johns Hopkins University has spent decades studying firearm injury prevention, and their findings are consistent.
Less than half of U.S. gun owners store all their firearms safely.
States with strong safe storage laws see fewer unintentional shootings. And when youth access to firearms is restricted, firearm suicides, the leading cause of death for Ohio teens, decline.
Ohio has no comprehensive safe storage law.
We have no statewide requirement that guns be locked when children are present.
We have no public education campaign to help families understand the risks.
And we have no consistent message from state leadership that safe storage is a basic responsibility of gun ownership.
Anyone who works with young people, teachers, foster parents, behavioral health workers, pediatricians, coaches knows how quickly a moment of impulsivity can turn into something irreversible.
Adolescents are wired for risk-taking. Their brains are still developing. They are curious, emotional, and often unaware of consequences.
A loaded, unlocked gun should never be part of that developmental landscape.
But policy alone won’t fix this. Culture matters too. That’s where Brady’s ASK (Asking Saves Kids) campaign comes in.
The idea is simple: before your child visits another home, ask the adults there one question: “Is there an unlocked gun in your home?”
It’s not rude. It’s not political. It’s responsible.
We already ask about allergies, pets, supervision, and seatbelts.
Asking about guns is no different, especially in a state where nearly half of households have firearms.
Normalizing this question could save lives.
Ohio has an opportunity and an obligation to prevent the next tragedy.
We can pass a statewide safe storage law grounded in public health research.
We can fund public education campaigns likeEnd Family Fire.
We can promote ASK through schools, pediatricians, and youth programs.
And we can support families by providing free or low‑cost gun locks and safes.
These steps aren’t anti‑gun. They’re pro‑child. They’re pro‑family. They’re pro‑responsibility.
Thoughts and prayers won’t bring Thomas back. They won’t ease his brother’s lifelong trauma. They won’t comfort a family that will replay that moment forever. But action can prevent the next tragedy.
Safe storage is simple. It’s effective. And it’s the bare minimum we owe the children of Ohio.
If we want to honor Thomas and every child harmed by an unsecured gun we start by locking up firearms, asking the hard questions, and refusing to accept preventable deaths as the cost of doing nothing.

Baird/U.S. Marine Corps)A federal appeals court Tuesday upheld Maryland’s law banning guns in a wide range of public settings, from school grounds and government buildings to parks, sports venues and areas within 1,000 feet of a public demonstration.
A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that most of the dozen places identified in Maryland law fall under the U.S. Supreme Court’a definition of “sensitive places,” where government has the authority to restrict the Second Amendment right to bear arms.
The only area where the appeals court said the sensitive places exception did not apply was in “private property held open to the public,” where the law prohibits guns without specific permission from the property owner. That restriction is unconstitutionally broad, Circuit Judge Robert L. Gregory wrote for the court.
“Maryland’s rule would effectively declare most public places ‘gun-free zones,” Gregory wrote. “But that likely stretches the sensitive places doctrine too far.”
In a partial dissent, Circuit Judge Steven Agee agreed with the majority that school grounds, government buildings and health care facilities are sensitive places where guns can be banned. But approving the state’s laundry list of other places where guns can be prohibited would stretch the sensitive places exception “into a broad license to prohibit firearms in locations where people gather for almost any purpose, so long as those purposes are separately listed to give the appearance of limited scope.”

Mark Pennak is president of the gun rights group Maryland Shall Issue, which was a party to one of the two challenges to Maryland’s law that were combined into the case ruled on Tuesday. He said that while he was pleased the court rejected the law banning firearms on private property open to the public, gun advocates were “considering our options” on how to proceed the rest of the case. The plaintiffs could ask for the case to be reheard in front of the full 4th Circuit, or the could appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown’s (D) office declined to comment on the ruling Tuesday evening. But in a statement later Tuesday night, Gov. Wes Moore (D) called the court’s ruling “a major win for public safety in Maryland.”
“We will continue working with law enforcement, community leaders, and partners across the state to keep illegal guns off our streets and prevent tragedy before it happens – while respecting the rights of responsible gun owners,” the governor’s statement said.
Everytown Law, the litigation arm of Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, also welcomed the court’s decision. Everytown for Gun Safety joined a handful fo gun-control groups and 18 other states that sided with Maryland in the case.
“By upholding Maryland’s sensitive places law, the Fourth Circuit has joined a growing judicial consensus that it’s constitutional to protect our communities from the particular dangers guns present in locations like parks, school grounds, public transit systems, and bars,” said a statement from Janet Carter, managing director of Second Amendment litigation at Everytown Law. “It’s time for gun extremists to recognize that their efforts to undermine these life-saving protections are as futile as they are reckless.”
Maryland law, with some exceptions, bans guns in a range of places where people gather: in government buildings, in public transportation, on school grounds, within 1,000 feet of a public demonstration, in state parks and forests, in museums, in health care facilities, at stadiums, at racetracks, at amusement parks, at casinos and in locations that sell alcohol.
The prohibitions were part of the Gun Rights Safety Act of 2023. On the same day it was signed into law, it was challenged by Susannah Warner Kipke, the wife of Del. Nic Kipke (R-Anne Arundel), and the Maryland State Rifle and Pistol Association, on First, Second and 14th amendment grounds. A separate, but similar, challenge was filed by Katherine Novotny and Maryland Shall Issue, along with the Second Amendment Foundation.
Supreme Court lets stand ruling that upholds Maryland handgun law

U.S. District Judge George L. Russell III combined the complaints into one case, before ruling in August 2024 to uphold most of the Gun Safety Act of 2023.
Gregory wrote that the combined cases gave the appeals court its first opportunity to analyze the sensitive places excepti0n to the Second Amendment under the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen. That case said courts must determine if gun regulations are “consistent with this nation’s historical tradition.”
In the case of the Second Amendment, that would be laws in effect in 1791 when the Bill of Rights was ratified. If there is no exact match to the law from history, it’s the court’s job to determine if the new law is “analogous enough to pass constitutional muster,” Gregory wrote
The Supreme Court specifically named government buildings and schools a sensitive places, Gregory wrote.
“Simply put, there’s no daylight between the delineated place ‘schools’ and the remaining property on which they sit, which often perform identical functions and serve the same populations as the school buildings themselves,” Gregory wrote. “Similarly, government buildings – while potentially capacious – have similarly been identified by the Supreme Court as places where governments have historically been able to control access to firearms.”
For each of the other places named in the law, the court found historical precedents that justified the constitutionality of the restriction.
But Agee said that — except for schools, government buildings and health care facilities — the majority “simply fails to follow how the Supreme Court has directed courts to consider the historical tradition of firearm regulation when examining whether a particular law violates the Second Amendment right to carry arms in public.”
“How the Supreme Court has undertaken this historical inquiry demonstrates that the absence of Founding-Era regulations appropriately analogous to a challenged law means that the challenged law is unconstitutional, regardless of the later historical record,” he wrote.
While the Supreme Court should clarify the application of the sensitive places doctrine, Agee wrote, it never intended for the exception to be “a smokescreen for inclined legislatures or courts to conjure up some metaphysical connection so that a handful of localized laws can serve as  ‘analogues’ for sweeping regulation of the core Second Amendment right.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2417294-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-21 03:57:30.435839

The map would shift Democratic voters into the 1st District, currently held by GOP Rep. Andy Harris, and will require changes to equalize population in the districts. (Map courtesy Governor's Redistricting Advisory Commission)A five-member panel voted behind closed doors Tuesday to advance a “congressional map concept” that will be used as a guide for legislation that will attempt to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts.
The Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission voted 3-2 to recommend the map to Gov. Wes Moore (D) and the Maryland General Assembly. U.S. Senate Angela Alsobrooks (D), who chaired the panel, said the vote followed a “transparent redistricting process.”
“From the start, our commitment has been simple: Put Marylanders in the driver’s seat,” Alsobrooks said in a statement following a roughly one-hour meeting that the public could not observe.
“This process has been conducted in the open, with opportunities for the public to participate, weigh in, and submit their own map proposals for consideration,” her statement said. “All Marylanders — regardless of party, background, or ZIP code — can engage with this process, see the options, and make their voice heard.”
The concept map overhauls the 1st District — the state’s lone Republican district, held by GOP Rep. Andy Harris. While the district currently  includes the Eastern Shore, Cecil, and part of eastern Baltimore County, the conceptual map would have it strething from the Eastern Shore over the Bay Bridge through Anne Arundel County and into part of Columbia in Howard County. The shift moves more liberal Democrats into the district held by Harris, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.
Changes to districts held by Democrats do not appear to threaten control of those seats.

The vote was blasted by state Republicans, with House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) saying it “confirmed what we have been saying all along: that this Commission had nothing to do with fairness, nothing to do with the wants and needs of our citizens, and, quite frankly, nothing to do with Maryland.”
“Instead, this Commission has everything to do with D.C. partisan politics and the desires of the Democratic National Committee,” Buckel said. “This Commission was merely a drawn-out political sham with a predetermined outcome: To rid Maryland of any Republican representation in Congress and disenfranchise voters in Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore. Nothing drives this home more than their absurd end product.”
National Democratic leaders, who have been pressing Maryland to respond to redistricting schemes in GOP states, hailed the vote.
“Partisan Republican hacks were counting on Democrats to roll over while they gerrymander congressional maps in Texas, Missouri, North Carolina and Florida,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. “They were wrong. Arrogant and corrupt Republicans started this battle. Democrats will end it. We will ensure that there is a free and fair midterm election in November.”
But redistricting still faces a difficult future in Maryland, where Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), a member of the commission, is opposed to midcycle redistricting. A redistricting bill, should it reach the Senate, is not expected to receive a vote from the full chamber.
Ferguson and fellow commission member, Cumberland Mayor Ray Morriss, a Republican, voted against the proposed map Tuesday.
Ferguson said in a statement that the map “fails the Governor’s own test. It breaks apart more neighborhoods and communities than our existing map, and it fails the constitutional requirement of one person, one vote. We heard from no Boards of Elections. We heard nothing from the Office of the Attorney General of Maryland, which would have to defend this process and outcome. We heard no testimony to the impact on our election cycle. Ultimately, a flawed process has delivered a flawed product.”
Morris, who said he was asked to serve on the commission to ensure fair congressional districts, said that, “After a while, it became obvious that definition of fair that was being put out there was what was fair for the Democratic Party.”

The governor’s office said it will send the proposed map to the House speaker’s office, and from there “it will be in the hands of the Maryland General Assembly,” Moore said recently, noting that it “is not an administration bill.”
Moore has defended the commission he empaneled as transparent. But there was little public notice for Tuesday’s closed-door meeting, the second time the panel met and made decisions in private.
Four of the five members reached by Maryland Matters said they believed the meeting should have been held in public, and that the public would have benefited from witnessing the deliberations. But former Attorney General Brian Frosh, a commission member, said that while the closed-door meeting bothered him “it’s the governor’s commission, and he can run in any way he wants…. If he says, you’re going to do this in private. I think we end up doing it in private.”
The work of the panel at times seemed slapped together. There was initial confusion about how districts needed to be drawn or if changes would affect local election boards. Alsobrooks, in the panel’s first meeting, promised in-person meetings, but those never materialized.
“I’ve had concerns about the way this process has moved forward from the get-go,” Ferguson told reporters during a meeting before the commission met.
A concept of a map
The legislation will start in the House.
House Majority Leader Del. David Moon (D-Montgomery) said a bill could be introduced quickly — possibly as early as the end of next week.
“If you’re the Speaker’s office, you can get it done pretty quickly, but there’s still logistical process, right?” Moon said, adding that there are some “logistical” hurdles that will need to be overcome.
“It’s going to be a multiday process, but, but I do think we are talking a matter of days, not weeks,” Moon said. “And again, if there’s a will to act, I do believe you’ll see the House wanting to act as soon as possible. I would hope this could be a conversation handled in the first month of session.”
The map approved by the commission will not likely be the one that goes to lawmakers, said Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), a member of the commission who expects to lead the bill on the floor and may also be its sponsor.
“That map will not be the map submitted with the bill,” Wilson said. “It will be zeroed out. That was a concept of the map … because time is an issue. When citizens put maps in, they’re not going to be exact. If they were, well, that’d be a whole other question, wouldn’t it?”
The concept map increases the number of majority-minority districts from two to three. Two have populations that are at least 50% Black voters. But the map also included population deviations some members said would not meet strict “one person, one vote” population standards used by the courts.
Ferguson’s statement called the map “objectively unconstitutional.” He said the new map will likely result in the current map facing a court challenge. Democrats, he warned, risk losing seats the party currently holds.

Former Attorney General Brian Frosh, a member of the commission, said Ferguson’s characterization was inaccurate.
“We voted on a map in concept,” Frosh said, “The map needs to be tweaked. I don’t think it requires major changes. But it’s not perfectly aligned in terms of the numbers. You have to be within a few votes one way or another, a few people one way or another. It probably is out of line in a way that can be fixed.”
Frosh said the tweak should take “half an hour or 45 minutes by the folks at the Department of Legislative Services.”
The adjustments may not matter. Ferguson is a staunch opponent of mid-cycle redistricting, and any bill passed by the House is likely to be sent to the Senate Rules Committee to die without a committee hearing or full Senate vote.
‘Statistically, it just didn’t add up’
The commission recommended the concept map following a series of 10 meetings — two of which were closed to the public.
More than three dozen maps were submitted by the public. The maps ranged from the basic, with no supporting documentation, to sophisticated iterations that included party registration and demographic data. But in two meetings one map, which was later tweaked, clearly garnered most of the attention.
“To me, when 28 out of 30 people all talk about the same map, it seems just, I don’t know, it just seemed a little odd to me,” Morriss said. “Everybody seemed to know which map they were going to talk about.”
When asked if he felt an outcome had been predetermined, Morriss said it “definitely gave the perception, to me, that something could be a little odd about it. Statistically, it just didn’t add up. So, yes.”
Morriss questioned the vote by the panel, noting that most of the public testimony did not support mid-cycle redistricting.
“I look back at the beginning, when over 70% of the people didn’t want to move forward,” Morriss said. “I think that said a lot. I think what the public got from this was what the Democratic party wanted for the state of Maryland, and for their national agenda. I don’t think the public really got a real — let’s use the word fair — a real, fair analysis of the congressional districts in the state.”
Wilson rejected that argument, saying testimony of roughly 30 people in each meeting was not the only consideration for the commission.
“This was a hearing,” Wilson said. “Not a poll.”
The ‘fair’ question
Moore appointed the panel in November, saying he he wanted to ensure the maps drawn in 2022 were “fair.” He has never provided a definition of the term.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But his efforts came as Republican states began hyper-partisan midcycle redistricting. The effort, kicked off in Texas, was seen as a way to improve chances of keeping a GOP majority in Congress in this fall’s elections.
In an interview a week ago, Moore said Maryland was reacting to Republican states who recast their maps to eliminate Democrats in Congress.
“The point is this is that if the rest of the country is going to go through a process of determining whether or not they have fair mass in a mid-decade process, then so will the state of Maryland,” Moore said during The Daily Record’s Eye on Annapolis opening day event.
In Maryland, the Democratic Party holds a 2-1 registration advantage over Republican voters, with Democrats accounting for about 50% of registered voters and the GOP and unaffiliated voters accounting for about 25% each.
Even so, Democrats hold seven of eight congressional seats in Maryland; 25 years ago, Republicans held four of the eight seats.
“It was not necessarily, in my mind, what was fair to all of the voters of the state of Maryland,” Morriss said of the commission’s work. “Especially in this case, the Republicans and the unaffiliated voters.”
Frosh said the commission and its recommendation was a response to Trump and MAGA Republicans policies on immigration, voting rights and the push for Republican states to redraw their own districts.
“I think that we can’t be holier than thou in this situation. If the Supreme Court says all you need to do is have an equal number of votes and not openly discriminate, then that’s what we should do,” Frosh said. “Why should we? Why should we cede that advantage to the Republican states? And I just think we’ve got to fight back, and as the old saying goes, you don’t bring a knife to a gunfight.”
Wilson agreed and said complaints about fairness from Maryland Republicans are not persuasive when racial equity is under attack by the Republicans at the federal level.
“The one thing I will clearly say is that my children are a protected class, and we can’t pretend that African Americans are the same thing as being Republican,” Wilson said. “And I don’t hear them saying that … about Texas, about Florida, about Missouri. I don’t see them fighting for a protected class of people in a country with a history of racism and violence.
“And to be clear, they still have a voice. They can still vote,” said Wilson. “My people couldn’t vote for the longest time. They can still vote.”

Nevertheless, the first-year anniversary of Trump 2.0 is a good time to pause and take stock of the performance of his administration to date.
An honest assessment of this issue suggests that, to put it mildly, it has not been a good year for American democracy and for tens of millions of people that reside in the United States. My goal here is to highlight five areas in which our democracy and well-being have been undermined in the past year: rule of law, dismantling the federal government, incoherent foreign policy, the economy, and the overall welfare and safety of Americans.
On his very first day in office —January 20, 2025— Trump issued an executive order that granted pardons to more than 1,200 people convicted in connection with Jan. 6, 2021 siege of the U.S. Capitol and commuted the sentences of 14 others. Among the 14 individuals whose sentences were commuted was Oath Keeper founder Stuart Rhodes who received an 18-year sentence for seditious conspiracy.
According to various reports, despite the fact that Trump was presented with several options regarding the January 6, 2021 rioters, he decided to issue sweeping pardons, including ones for all rioters convicted of violence against police and Capitol security as well as one for the leader of the Proud Boys Enrique Tarrio who was sentenced to 22 years in prison.
Many of the individuals that Trump chose to pardon had pleaded guilty for their crimes while others had been convicted at their trials by impartial judges. By opting to issue these sweeping pardons, Trump began his second term by raising his middle finger and dealing a significant blow to the rule of law in the United States.
The second Trump term also began with Trump empowering Elon Musk and DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) to use a sledgehammer to cut governmental programs, personnel, and budgets. In his recent Atlantic Magazine article titled “The Purged,” Franklin Foer illustrates the impact of this purge on tens of thousands of federal workers and the programs that they were running. Foer writes that by April 2025, “entire departments—the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—had been gutted.”
Some people might not remember today that during the 2024 campaign, Trump promised to end the war between Russia and Ukraine in 24 hours. A year into his presidency and almost four years since Russia invaded Ukraine, there are few signs that this conflict will be resolved anytime soon. In fact, one could make a strong case that Russia’s attacks on Ukraine have only intensified since Trump came into office again.
Trump’s incoherent foreign policy can also be seen in the recent abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and the aftermath of this seizure. Although Maduro was a brutal dictator, the Trump administration is now supporting Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro’s Vice President, who was herself implicated in many crimes and sanctioned by the U.S. government rather than the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, to lead the transitional government in Venezuela. In supporting Rodríguez, the Trump administration is signaling that they are more concerned with a leader that will look out for American oil interests than one that will ensure a transition to democracy in Venezuela.
Trump came into office in January of 2025 promising to focus on the cost of living and to lower grocery prices and inflation. However, one of Trump’s first actions as President during his second term was to impose heavy tariffs on dozens of countries including U.S. allies like the U.K., Canada and Mexico.
According to a report in the New York Times, in large part because of the Trump tariffs “grocery prices are still rising, undercutting his administration’s rhetoric about how it is making life more affordable for average Americans.” For instance, since Trump took office the price of beef has risen 16.4 percent, the price of coffee is up 19.8 percent, while the price of frozen fish is 8.6 percent higher. Rent prices have also gone up in the past year and the cost of health insurance is set to skyrocket for many Americans because the Administration refused to extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies.
Finally, the Trump Administration has unleashed the forces of ICE to many American cities in order to “protect” the American people against the invasion of illegal immigrants into our communities. Yet, as we all witnessed in the past two weeks in the city of Minneapolis with the killing of Renee Good—an unarmed American citizen and mother of three—by an ICE agent, the administration’s immigration policy has resulted in more violence, increased tensions, and in many Americans feeling less safe in their own communities.
Any honest assessment — even one that merely scratches the surface — should conclude that the damage on American democracy and society wrought in only one year by the second Trump Administration is dreadful and will take a long time to undo.

From groceries to heating bills to basic household expenses, residents across our state are feeling squeezed and living under the weight of rising costs that make it harder to get by.

Lisa Hammersley

Over half of Connecticut families report difficulty meeting basic needs with many more struggling to pay utility bills. Others are tapping into savings just to afford groceries and trying to survive under the pressure of an affordability crisis.
Now a similar pressure is hitting our public schools. As school districts face rising costs, communities are facing an impossible choice: cut programs and services critical to students or pass the increased expenses on to families and local taxpayers who are already stretched thin.
To avoid placing an even greater weight on the backs of taxpayers, or negatively impacting the opportunities and quality of education accessible to students, policymakers must act during the upcoming legislative session. Now is the time for Gov. Ned Lamont and legislators to provide some much-needed relief to communities and taxpayers by adjusting state education funding annually to account for inflation.
Over the past eight years, legislators across the political spectrum have come together to make significant improvements to Connecticut’s school finance system and the state’s Education Cost Sharing (ECS) formula, which is the primary mechanism for distributing state education dollars to communities. A sign of that progress is this school year, after an eight-year gradual phase-in, the ECS formula will be “fully funded” for historically underfunded school districts for the first time in state history.
Although a fully funded ECS formula is a landmark achievement, it also means there are no built-in annual increases for districts going forward. This is because the phase-in of the formula is complete and the formula’s “foundation” doesn’t account for inflation. Instead, the ECS formula’s foundation amount — intended to represent the cost of educating a general education student with no additional learning needs — has remained the same since 2013 when it was raised by roughly $1,800 to the current amount of $11,525. For comparison, had the formula’s foundation simply kept pace with inflation, it would be approximately $16,000 per student today — aligning far more closely with what districts actually spend to educate their students.
While the ECS formula’s lack of accounting for inflation was largely masked as the formula was being phased in over time, it now poses a significant challenge to schools, communities, and taxpayers as the formula is fully funded and districts are left with a decade-old foundation amount that doesn’t reflect today’s costs. Without an annual adjustment for inflation, education cuts or property tax increases are the remaining options for school districts and municipalities. Neither is acceptable.
At a time when so many families are struggling to afford basic necessities, Connecticut cannot shift more of the cost of education onto the very people least able to absorb it. We cannot continually place the burden of rising costs on local taxpayers and ask municipalities to raise property taxes, particularly when many residents are already facing higher tax bills as a result of soaring home values and revaluations.
Relying on property tax revenue to always pick up the tab of inflation is not a sustainable or equitable practice. It makes our state less affordable, prevents families from settling down in Connecticut, and disproportionately harms low- and moderate-income residents who already pay a larger share of their income in property taxes. And in a state where over 57% of education funding comes from local tax dollars, it has an outsized impact on our highest-need and lowest-wealth districts — widening longstanding disparities and deepening cycles of poverty that hold families and Connecticut back.
At the same time, students’ education cannot be made to suffer because of rising costs. We cannot have students see services reduced, course offerings cut, and extracurriculars eliminated because state education funding doesn’t provide for increases in essential costs such as transportation, utilities, insurance, and instructional materials. Cuts, like the ones districts are facing due to rising costs, weaken school climates, reduce academic support, and make it harder for students to learn.
Fortunately, there is a solution and time for Gov. Lamont and the General Assembly to act and prevent communities from having to resort to education cuts or property tax hikes. Indexing the ECS formula’s foundation amount to inflation would provide predictable, annual adjustments that reflect real-world costs, support students by preventing cuts to essential programs and staff, reduce pressure on local taxpayers, and make our state more affordable, stable, and competitive. This is a simple, sustainable, and common-sense solution that would benefit every school district and community in Connecticut.
Our state has made significant progress in recent years when it comes to education funding and has taken meaningful steps toward ensuring every public school student receives fair funding no matter where they live or go to school. But without annually updating the ECS formula’s foundation for inflation, that progress will erode quickly — and students, families, and taxpayers will pay the price.
At a time when residents are stretched thin, student academic and mental health needs are growing, and teachers are in short supply, the state must step up. An annual inflation adjustment to the ECS foundation is a fair, future-focused investment that strengthens our schools, supports our taxpayers, and keeps our promise to the next generation.
Connecticut’s students deserve nothing less.

Wes Moore (D) and Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), speaks Tuesday at a Severna Park bulk-food market on ""dynamic pricing"" legislation. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) and legislative leaders unveiled legislation Tuesday they said will prohibit so-called “dynamic pricing,” to ensure that Maryland grocery stores are not using surveillance data to charge some consumers more than others for the same product.
“The same algorithms that can predict what we need, can also be weaponized to exploit while we need it,” Moore said Tuesday at a small bulk grocery store in Severna Park called BD Provisions. “Price can change constantly — by the hour, by the minute and even by the second, based on who you are and where you shop.”
The proposed  legislation would require grocery prices to stay fixed for at least one business day, avoiding rapid changes throughout the day. The proposed legislation would also prohibit retailers from using surveillance data in automated systems to set individualized prices.
“This is not a fair market,” Moore said. “This is a stacked deck. This is about profit … Profit that’s extracted from people who are seeing their bills increase and who are struggling to afford basic goods.”
But retailers say that the conversation around dynamic pricing misrepresents how pricing groceries work. The Maryland Retailers Alliance denies that grocery prices can fluctuate from person-to-person to reflect personal consumer data, and any suggestion otherwise is “simply inaccurate.”

But as Marylanders continue to see rising grocery costs, state and national lawmakers worry that the growing use of electronic shelf labels let grocery stores change prices at any time, leading to concerns of price gouging or even charging individuals differently based on personal data collection.
That’s why Moore, flanked by the Senate president and House speaker Tuesday, is backing the Protection from Predatory Pricing Act, to protect consumers from any such price-changing attempts.
“As rising costs continue to eat away at paychecks, government must stand up for working families,” House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) said. “People are barely making it. These are difficult times that we are living in…. They’re making tough choices in what they spend. So dynamic pricing, we have to address it.”
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said grocery stores that use dynamic pricing practices disrupt the balance between consumers and retailers.
“What we know in basic economics is that a market works when buyers and sellers have the same information. The price is set, the buyer knows what it is and can choose across different places,” Ferguson said.
“However, when the seller is changing the price based on who it is, based on unclear information, based on personal data that’s been siphoned off from every possible avenue you can imagine, and the price changes by the time you walk in the door to when you put that loaf of bread on the counter – that is called a failed marketplace,” he said.
The bill would build off the Maryland Online Data Privacy Act from the 2024 legislative session.  “Surveillance pricing” would be considered an unfair or deceptive trade practice under the Maryland Consumer Protection Act, with grocery stores subject to a $10,000 fine for the first offense and then up to $25,000 for subsequent offenses, enforced by the Office of the Attorney General.
Retailers say it’s a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.

“Grocery shelf prices are the same for every customer who walks through the door, regardless of who they are, where they live, or what they have purchased in the past. Claims suggesting otherwise are simply inaccurate,” the Maryland Retailers Alliance said in a written statement.
“Much of the confusion stems from a misunderstanding of dynamic or algorithmic pricing, which retailers use to manage inventory, respond to wholesale cost changes, and remain competitive,” the statement said. “This technology helps retailers adjust prices uniformly across all shoppers based on factors such as supplier costs, seasonality, promotions, and market competition—not personal consumer data.”
The Maryland Chamber of Commerce said it will be reviewing the legislation once the bill is formally introduced.
“As recently enacted taxes and regulations continue to pressure businesses and consumers, proposals that restrict pricing tools risk unintended consequences and deserve careful scrutiny,” according to a written statement from Mary Kane, president and CEO of the Maryland Chamber of Commerce. “Policies shouldn’t reduce flexibility or open the door to broader market disruption through government-imposed pricing rules.”

CoreCivic opera este centro.","This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Esta es una historia en desarrollo que se actualizará.
Los senadores demócratas estadounidenses Alex Padilla y Adam Schiff realizaron el martes una visita de supervisión al centro de detención de inmigrantes más nuevo y más grande del estado, ubicado en California City , a unas 100 millas al norte de Los Ángeles.
 En declaraciones a los periodistas, ambos destacaron lo que describieron como atención médica inadecuada en el lugar.
“El comentario más frecuente que recibimos fue sobre la insuficiencia de la atención médica que reciben [las personas recluidas]”, dijo Schiff. Describió haber conocido a una detenida diabética que, según él, no ha recibido tratamiento para su condición en dos meses. “Es aterrador”, dijo.
Más de 1,400 personas se encuentran actualmente recluidas en el Centro de Detención de California City, administrado por la empresa penitenciaria privada con fines de lucro CoreCivic, en pleno desierto de Mojave. Este centro abrió sus puertas a finales de agosto gracias a un contrato con el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas de Estados Unidos (ICE) con capacidad para albergar a 2,560 detenidos.
Anteriormente, CoreCivic operaba el sitio como una prisión estatal. La administración Newsom rescindió el contrato en 2024, tras el cierre de varias prisiones estatales debido a la disminución de la población carcelaria en California.
“Tendrán que hacer algo muy diferente si quieren satisfacer las necesidades médicas de la gente que ya está allí, además de cuando añadan otras mil personas”, dijo Padilla.
Schiff dijo que habló con personas que describieron agua maloliente y con un detenido que describió un sándwich mohoso. Tanto Padilla como Schiff destacaron que las personas estaban recluidas en condiciones similares a las de una prisión, a pesar de que muchas de ellas no habían cometido ningún delito, sino solo infracciones civiles de inmigración.
“Esto no es una prisión, a pesar del entorno, por lo que nos preocupa igualmente la atención a la salud mental”, dijo Padilla. “Uno se puede imaginar la experiencia de estar detenido, ser amenazado con la deportación y el impacto que esto tiene en el individuo y en su familia, que puede ser traumático. Descubrimos que aquí también falta atención a la salud mental”.
Schiff dijo que muchas de las personas con las que habló dentro del centro fueron detenidas en sus citas de inmigración. “Así que estaban haciendo lo que se supone que deben hacer para convertirse en ciudadanos o establecer una presencia legal y, en esas citas, fueron detenidos y separados de sus familias”, afirmó.
También describió su encuentro con un hombre de Afganistán que dijo haber ayudado al ejército estadounidense allí y que sería asesinado por los talibanes si regresaba a su país.“Quieren deportarlo de vuelta a Afganistán. Le ofrecieron alternativas como Sudán y otros lugares con los que no tiene ningún vínculo. Estas son las historias que escuchamos”, dijo Schiff.
 Antes de ingresar a la instalación, Schiff y Padilla dijeron que estaban realizando la inspección para “responder a las quejas y preguntas de los electores sobre las condiciones en las que se encuentran los detenidos” y para “ver de primera mano cómo es esta instalación”.
 “En este aniversario del segundo gobierno de Trump, un año después, hay un par de cosas que ya sabemos que definen su mandato: la crueldad y la agresividad excesiva de la agenda de deportación masiva”, dijo Padilla.
 “Esta es una parte necesaria de nuestra supervisión”, dijo Schiff. “Todos hemos estado trabajando con electores que han estado o están detenidos aquí y han descrito el deterioro de las condiciones”.
Democrats want to visit ICE centers
 Por ley, los miembros del Congreso tienen derecho a realizar inspecciones sin previo aviso a los centros de detención migratoria. Sin embargo, el portavoz de Padilla afirmó que los senadores programaron la visita con antelación.
En julio, los demócratas de la Cámara de Representantes demandaron ante las cortes a la administración por una política que exigía un aviso de siete días para las visitas, argumentando que violaba la ley federal. En diciembre de 2025, la jueza federal Jia Cobb en Washington, D. C., bloqueó temporalmente el requerimiento de aviso de siete días mientras el caso se resuelve en los tribunales.
 Tras un tiroteo mortal en el que estuvo involucrado un agente de inmigración en Minneapolis, la secretaria del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, Kristi Noem, emitió un nuevo memorando el 8 de enero, reinstaurando el requisito de preaviso de siete días. El 19 de enero, Cobb no bloqueó de inmediato esta nueva política, ya reinstaurada, concluyendo que la directiva del 8 de enero constituía una “nueva medida de la agencia” que requería una impugnación legal diferente a la previamente decidida.
Cuando el presidente Donald Trump asumió el cargo hace un año , aproximadamente 40.000 personas se encontraban en centros de detención migratoria en todo el país. A principios de diciembre, esa cifra había aumentado casi un 75%, con casi 66.000 personas detenidas en centros de detención migratoria en todo Estados Unidos, y el sistema, según se informa, tenía capacidad para albergar a 70,000 personas en un día cualquiera, el nivel más alto en la historia de Estados Unidos, según datos del gobierno.
La supervisión en California
 El mes pasado, la Fiscalía General de California advirtió sobre las “condiciones peligrosas” en las instalaciones de California City. En una carta del 19 de diciembre dirigida a Noem, el abogado Michael Newman escribió que el Departamento de Justicia de California “tiene serias preocupaciones sobre las condiciones en las instalaciones y la falta de atención médica adecuada”, tras inspeccionarlas.
 El Fiscal General Rob Bonta dijo que la instalación “había abierto prematuramente y no estaba preparada para manejar las necesidades de la población entrante”.
 Ryan Gustin, portavoz de CoreCivic, declaró previamente a Calmatters que el centro cuenta con una sólida atención médica y de salud mental, incluyendo acceso a estos servicios las 24 horas. Añadió que estos servicios cumplen con los estándares establecidos por nuestros socios gubernamentales.
 “No hay demoras para que las personas obtengan sus medicamentos recetados”, dijo Gustin.
 En noviembre, los detenidos en la instalación presentaron una demanda , alegando que la instalación está contaminada por fugas de aguas residuales e infestaciones de insectos, y que los detenidos no pueden obtener atención médica adecuada para afecciones que amenazan la vida.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/012026-Padilla-Schiff-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-20 23:57:25.506423

Ford,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2026/01/20/sheriffs-defend-work-with-ice-under-immigration-enforcement-program/,"Two days before the Senate hears a bill to ban local law enforcement agencies from entering into immigration enforcement agreements with federal officials, sheriffs gathered Tuesday in Annapolis to tell lawmakers to leave 287(g) agreements alone.","Frederick County Sheriff Chuck Jenkins, backed by other sheriffs and Senate Republicans, speaks at a news conference Tuesday in defense of 287(g) agreements with federal immigration agencies. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Two days before a Maryland Senate committee hears a bill that would ban local law enforcement agencies from entering into immigration enforcement agreements with the federal government, some sheriffs gathered Tuesday in Annapolis to tell lawmakers to let them “do their job.”
Specifically, the sheriffs want to continue operating under 287(g) agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that let them hold suspects an additional 48 hours, if they are determined to be undocumented, to hand over to ICE for immigration proceedings.
“It’s a true public safety tool,” said Frederick County Sheriff Chuck Jenkins, who was backed by other sheriffs and Senate Republicans. “We simply don’t return criminals back onto the street. We hand those individuals off to ICE in a safe setting in their detention center.”
Besides Frederick County, which Jenkins said has had an agreement with ICE since 2008, seven other sheriff’s departments in the state have signed 287(g) agreements, five of them in the past year.
The sheriffs were in Annapolis to speak out against Senate Bill 245, which would prohibit a sheriff, local police or any “agent of the state” from entering into an agreement with the federal government to enforce civil immigration law. The fill, set to be heard Thursday by the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, has some powerful sponsors: In addition to Sen. Karen Lewis Young (D-Frederick), the bill is being backed this year by the committee chair, Sen. William C. Smith Jr.  (D-Montgomery), and Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City).

In a meeting with reporters Tuesday, Ferguson said that “everyone is entitled to their opinion, but that he was “disappointed by the sentiment that sheriffs in Maryland feel that what is happening and the way that ICE is attempting to enforce law – anonymously with masks, indiscriminately ripping people out of cars and homes – I find it quite disappointing that that is the standard that offices want to partner with.”
“It gives me a great deal of pause about the efficacy of the trust between the populace that they serve and the future for law enforcement moving forward,” he said.
A ban on 287(g) agreements was included in an immigration bill in last year’s legislative session, but that language was stripped out at the last minute in the Senate. Criminal justice reform advocates have since pointed to the failure of that law as ICE tactics have become more aggressive in the past year under President Donald Trump (R). Data from the Prison Policy Initiative showed the more than 3,000 people in Maryland were arrested last year by ICE.
The federal agency has received intense scrutiny since the shooting of Renee Good, 37, in Minneapolis this month.
But Sen. William G. Folden (R-Frederick) said that what’s happening in Minnesota isn’t happening in Maryland. Claims that the 287(g) program isn’t working in Maryland represents “a lot of fear mongering. We hear a lot of distraction and virtue signaling.”
“Our sheriffs want to be very clear: We have no police … going out boots-on-the-ground, rounding people up and arresting illegal immigrants on the ground. That’s completely false,” he said. “Anybody that’s saying that is not familiar with Maryland’s laws and not familiar with the policies and the cooperative agreements with ICE.”
The immigrant rights group CASA has said the 287(g) program permits racial profiling, but the sheriffs say no.
When asked Tuesday if Black, Latino and other Marylanders of color should fear being detained by ICE, Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler had this message: “If you don’t want to get caught up in the 287(g) program, don’t sell drugs, don’t break the law, and you won’t get arrested and you won’t get screened in.”
Jenkins has said that if a ban on 287(g) is passed, it would be unconstitutional, a point he repeated Tuesday.
“The fact I’m a duly elected sheriff, I think there’s a real court challenge there,” Jenkins said. “I think sheriffs would prevail. I really do.”

Photos photo courtesy of Brown campaign and via the Law Offices of Buzzell, Welsh & Hill. Two candidates vying to represent a Macon-area Senate district are headed to a runoff after neither managed to clear the 50% threshold in a six-way race Tuesday.
Democrat LeMario Brown, a Peach County small business owner, farmer and former city council member, and Republican Steven McNeel, a Bibb County attorney, appear to be the top two vote-getters after the polls closed on Tuesday night, according to unofficial results from the secretary of state’s website. The other candidates, all Republicans, include former Forsyth Mayor Eric Wilson, former state Rep. Lauren Daniel, Army veteran Nathan Warnock and retired factory worker Eugene Allison.
Six candidates sign up to run for middle Georgia Senate seat after prominent Republican steps down

The district encompasses Crawford, Monroe, Peach and Upson counties, as well as part of Bibb and Houston counties.
Brown and McNeel are seeking to replace former state Sen. John F. Kennedy, a Macon Republican and the former President Pro Tem who has represented the district since 2014. Kennedy resigned in December to focus on his bid for lieutenant governor. 
The two candidates will face off again in a Feb. 17 runoff. The winner will serve an abbreviated term, assuming office roughly half of the way through this year’s legislative session, which began earlier this month and will end April 2. All members of the state Legislature will be up for re-election later this year.
In a statement, Brown vowed to keep working to flip the district blue.
“Our vision of a more affordable Georgia, where small businesses thrive, and healthcare access is available to all could be in reach if we all show up to the polls,” he said. “The finish line is close and we will not stop fighting until Senate District 18 has a strong leader under the Gold Dome.”
McNeel did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday night. Wilson, who appeared to come in third place, said he was disappointed in the results but respected the will of the voters in his district.
“We laid our message out there about affordability and cost of living, and that’s really what we focused on in this campaign,” Wilson said.
The Georgia Republican Party celebrated the advancement of a Republican to the runoff, noting that the party worked with leaders in the state Senate and district-level Republican organizations to drive up voter turnout.
“Republicans stepped up, overcame the noise, and now we’re heading into the runoff ready for the final round,” said Josh McKoon, the state GOP party chair.
The race also attracted attention from national Democrats, with U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona joining Brown on the campaign trail over the weekend. Georgia Democratic leadership also cheered Brown’s first-place finish. 
“The voters of Senate District 18 have sent a clear message that Georgia’s Republican leadership is not meeting the needs of working Georgians,” Senate Minority Leader Harold Jones of Augusta said in a statement. “LeMario Brown will keep fighting to bring costs down and quality of life up for the people of this district.”
At least one other Senate seat will sit empty for the time being after State Sen. Colton Moore, a  Trenton Republican, resigned from his seat representing Senate District 53 to run for Congress. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp scheduled the election to fill his seat for March 10.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-21 03:35:56+00:00,CT Mirror,Audit: McCrory controlled how Hartford nonprofit spent state money,Andrew Brown and Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/audit-mccrory-controlled-how-hartford-nonprofit-spent-state-money/,"Sen. Doug McCrory used the Blue Hills Civic Association to distribute millions to other local nonprofits of his choosing, an audit reports.","Over the past five years, Sen. Doug McCrory helped to award more than $15 million in state grants to the Blue Hills Civic Association, a prominent 60-year-old community nonprofit that served part of his district in the north end of Hartford.
But he used that organization as a means to distribute millions of dollars to other local nonprofits and businesses of his choosing, with little or no oversight over how they were spending that money, according to internal records and a newly released forensic audit conducted by the accounting firm of CliftonLarsonAllen LLP.
“Available documentation and email correspondence indicate that funding allocations were largely determined by Senator McCrory, with BHCA executing disbursements without consistent adherence to required procedures such as obtaining signed MOUs or projected budgets prior to payment,” the audit reported.
One of the largest beneficiaries of that spending was an organization operated by Sonserae Cicero, a local business and nonprofit leader whose relationship with McCrory is now being investigated by the FBI and a federal grand jury. 
Records obtained by the Connecticut Mirror and reviewed by the auditors show Vicki Gallon-Clark, the former director of the Blue Hills Civic Association, followed McCrory’s instructions about how the money should be spent and what organizations to fund. 
Over a roughly two-year period, Gallon-Clark directed more than $1.7 million — more than 10% of the money Blue Hills received from the state — to Cicero’s businesses, according to the audit.
Gallon-Clark declined to comment when reporters visited her home earlier this month. And McCrory, who is preparing to run for another term in the Connecticut Senate, did not return multiple phone calls and emails for this story. 
But the forensic audit, which was commissioned by the state Department of Economic and Community Development, concluded that many of the services Cicero was paid to perform during that period were never completed. And auditors reported that Blue Hills officials did little to oversee her work.
In 2022 and 2023, the Blue Hills Civic Association directly awarded Cicero’s business, which operates under the name SHEBA, more than half a million dollars that was supposed to go toward consulting services, including reviewing the Blue Hills Civic Association’s policies, leading management training sessions and starting a paid internship program, the audit reported. 
But in some cases, the audit reported, there was “no evidence” that programs she’d been paid for had actually taken place.
“Ms. Cicero reported dedicating 50 hours to training board directors for a total of $14,000,” the audit states. “No evidence was found to substantiate the claim that Ms. Cicero performed or facilitated board training during this period … Board members confirmed to CLA that they did not receive training in any format.”
“The disbursement activity between BHCA and SHEBA Consulting, as well as directly to Ms. Cicero, reveals a troubling pattern of financial mismanagement, potential fraud, and a complete breakdown of internal controls,” the auditors wrote. 
“Over $1.7 million in public funds were distributed based on invoices and budget claims that lack substantiation and supporting documentation,” they added. “”Numerous line items … were either grossly exaggerated or entirely unsupported by evidence.”
Internal records from Blue Hills also show that the leaders of the nonprofit sent more than $600,000 directly to Cicero’s business in 2023, and they orchestrated another payment of $615,000 in 2024. 
For that second transaction, McCrory directed Blue Hills Civic Association to arrange a “passthrough” that would allow the BHCA to avoid contracting with Cicero’s company directly, according to the audit.
That plan called for the Blue Hills Civic Association to transfer $1.5 million to another local nonprofit, the Upper Albany Neighborhood Collaborative, which subsequently signed a contract with Cicero, giving her the additional $615,000. 
By that point, state officials had been warned of a potential conflict of interest between McCrory and Cicero. And at least one member of the Blue Hills Civic Association’s board had raised concerns about the amount of money the nonprofit was giving to Cicero, according to The Hartford Courant. 
Because the money was routed through Blue Hills and the Upper Albany Neighborhood Collaborative, the state had no way of knowing the final recipient of the money.
Government transparency measures like the State Comptroller’s Open Checkbook website didn’t register the payments to SHEBA or any of the other businesses and nonprofits that received grants from Blue Hills. 
Emails and other records show that state officials had little to no idea what organizations the Blue Hills Civic Association was forwarding funding to until early 2025, just before the nonprofit reported that $300,000 of the state financial aid had been stolen through a fraudulent wire transfer. 
Around that time, employees at DECD remarked on the “ton of money” that the Blue Hills Civic Association received with McCrory’s help. They also noted that Blue Hills was subgranting huge sums of money — though they didn’t have records of what organizations the cash was flowing to. 
“Blue Hills Civic Association is a small but mighty organization which received over $15 million dollars in the last couple of years,” Jennifer Haag, a DECD employee, wrote in February 2025. “There have been questions on how the money has been given out to subrecipients … the final reporting we ask for is not that detailed.” 
DECD officially ordered the forensic audit of Blue Hills Civic Association last spring, after the nonprofit’s leaders told state officials about the $300,000 being sent to the wrong bank account. 
Blue Hills staff failed to report that event to the state for several months, though they did inform McCrory, who advised them not to share the information with the state before an FBI investigative report on the matter was received, according to the audit. 
“The rationale for BHCA’s delayed disclosure to DECD remains unclear, despite repeated indications that such notification was warranted. Clifton Larson Allen was also unable to determine the rationale for informing Senator McCrory prior to DECD,” the audit said.
While the audit primarily focuses on Blue Hills, it also makes several recommendations for how DECD can improve its monitoring of state grants and determine when nonprofits are subgranting money to other organizations. 
“DECD must establish clear expectations for monitoring by requiring the primary recipient to maintain accurate records and oversee its subrecipients,” the audit said. 
Recommendations for DECD include risk‑based monitoring during the grant year rather than relying solely on year‑end reporting and requiring earlier and more detailed subrecipient reporting, including proof of executed contracts before any money is disbursed to other organizations. 
In a press release included with the release of the forensic audit, DECD officials said they are directing Clifton Larson Allen to expand the forensic audit even further in the coming months by reviewing all of the organizations that received money from the Blue Hills Civic Association. 
State officials said that report will also be shared once it is completed.
In the meantime, DECD said any state funds that were previously intended for the Blue Hills Civic Association would remain frozen. 
The nonprofit laid off nearly all of its staff last spring after that funding freeze was initially put in place. 
“The allegations of fraud and misappropriation of public funds set forth in the audit do not permit the agency to continue such funding without additional due diligence,” they wrote. 
“This forensic audit is a strong reminder that when taxpayer dollars are involved, we have zero tolerance for fraud, waste, or mismanagement,” said Gov. Ned Lamont in the press release. “The findings at Blue Hills Civic Association are deeply troubling and underscore why we need stronger guardrails around legislatively directed funding.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MCCRORYHVAC1107-SR-1-e1763823363844-1024x762.jpg,,,2026-01-20 22:57:01.866116

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Republican-controlled Utah Legislature launched its 2026 general session Tuesday with top House and Senate GOP leaders celebrating the state’s strengths while calling for lawmakers to focus on ways to help people in their day-to-day lives — specifically by reducing cost of living and taxes. 
“We, as your representatives, see you, we hear you, and we endeavor to show up for you,” House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said during his opening day speech, listing issues including rising prices, housing, child care, education and Utahns’ hope to live in safer communities and to spend less time in traffic.
While highlighting the state’s current successes, Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said Utah is also “on track to become a national leader and the No. 1 state” for a list of industries, including: missile defense, energy production, cancer research, artificial intelligence, critical minerals and more.
“After 250 years, America is still the hope of the world. And I believe Utah is the hope of America,” Adams said.

Schultz and Adams’ messages were focused on optimism and calling on lawmakers to prioritize policies that have real-world impacts for Utahns and the state’s economic future. However, their opening-day speeches did not directly address some of the most controversial topics already sucking up much of the oxygen on Utah’s Capitol Hill, including several bills targeting transgender people and others aimed at restricting resources for immigrants without legal immigration status. 
Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, told reporters she worries the coming session is already being underscored by “mean” legislative proposals.
“They’re coming with everything,” Escamilla told reporters during a media availability, saying the immigrant and the LGBTQ+ communities are being directly attacked like she has never seen in her 18 years in the Legislature.
“I think some of these bills are pretty mean,” she said. “I mean, it’s at the core of keeping kiddos without access to health care or food at school. That’s a new low level.”
Senate Minority Assistant Whip Jen Plumb, D-Salt Lake City, said there are “some really difficult, some might even say horrifying, bills that are coming out,” but she added “those feel like distractions from the real issues at hand for our communities. We want to focus on those real issues, not on the cruel distractions.”

Governor calls for ‘dignity’ and ‘respect’ 
In an interview with Utah News Dispatch Tuesday morning, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox didn’t take a position on some of the more controversial bills filed so far targeting transgender people and undocumented immigrants, many of which are being sponsored by Rep. Trevor Lee, R-Layton. Cox said he will consider those bills on their merits if or when they land on his desk. 
“But I will just say that the Legislature is not that one person,” Cox said. “We’re going to be working very closely with the Legislature to get this right, to still show the respect that every citizen of our state deserves, our transgender citizens who live here, our immigrants who are here.” 
The governor also seemed to throw cold water on another bill being sponsored by Lee to rename Harvey Milk Boulevard in Salt Lake City after slain conservative influencer Charlie Kirk — a proposal city leaders and LGBTQ+ advocates have criticized as encroachment on local control as well as an attack on the gay icon.

Lee also sponsored a controversial bill last year that Cox wasn’t fond of — a bill to ban many flags (including pride or LGBTQ+ flags) from schools and all government buildings. Cox let that bill become law without his signature, and later called it a “dumb bill” while also criticizing Salt Lake City leaders for adopting pride or other flags symbolizing diversity and inclusion as official city banners in order to get around the law.
The governor said he expects lawmakers will show respect to “people in local municipalities who are making their own decisions, even if they’re decisions I disagree with, which was part of the flag bill last year and part of a street-naming bill this year.”

“If people want to get involved in municipal politics, they should run for municipal office. That’s the right way to do it,” Cox said.
He added that he will look at all of those bills “on the merits, but we’re going to show some dignity and some respect to the people who live here.”
When pressed in separate media availabilities with reporters, Adams and Schultz left an open question on whether those bills will find any traction. 
“You know, there will always be things that consume the news cycle,” Schultz told reporters. “A lot of them make a difference for Utahns, (but) a lot of them don’t make a difference for Utahns, honestly. But we’re really focused on the things that do make a difference for Utahns.” 
When pressed, Schultz didn’t name any specific bills he doesn’t want lawmakers to waste time on — but he said people will know when those bills “get held up” in the powerful House Rules Committee, which assigns bills to committee assignments.

“Certainly there’s always those bills that come out, they’re attention grabbers, but at the end of the day, do they really make a difference in people’s lives? Probably not,” he said. “We want to focus on the things that make a difference in people’s lives. Cost of living, again, those are going to be the ones we’re really focused on.” 
Schultz has told Utah News Dispatch he’s supportive of policies to lower property taxes for Utahns, and both he and Adams want to cut the state’s income tax rate for a 6th year in a row — on top of the more than $300 million in revenue not coming into the state’s budget this year due to federal tax cuts. 
Chief Justice Durrant on lawmakers’ plans to make changes to the judiciary
Another big issue looms over the 2026 Utah Legislature: How lawmakers will alter the state’s judiciary amid ongoing tensions between the two branches of government after a series of rulings that have upset Republican lawmakers, including in the state’s redistricting court battle. 
That tension carries over from last year, when lawmakers considered a slate of bills many legal professionals characterized as an “attack” on the judiciary’s independence — but most of those proposals fizzled. 
This year, though, legislators are expected to weigh more bills aimed at not only expanding the Utah Supreme Court and other courts, but also legislation to create more “transparency” requirements for judges and perhaps a proposed constitutional amendment that would, if approved by voters, let the Legislature call “special” retention elections for judges lawmakers deem “unfit or incompetent.” 
‘A broad attack’: Utah’s judiciary fights bills threatening its independence

Like he did last year, Utah Supreme Court Chief Justice Matthew Durrant addressed the strained relationship between the Legislature and the judiciary in his State of the Judiciary speech while also urging lawmakers who disagree with court rulings to do so on the “merits” of the decision, “not through impugning our integrity.” 
“Disagreement is inherent in our system of government,” Durrant told lawmakers. “Public disparagement of another branch is not. While polarized us-versus-them rhetoric has become common in national circles, it is not — and should not be — the norm here.” 
Durrant said that “much of the frustration expressed” with the judiciary in recent years “stems from a small number of decisions.” 
“Those decisions can be counted on one hand, yet we handle nearly 500,000 cases annually in our trial courts,” he said. “I ask that your disappointment with a few results not lead to penalties for an entire branch of government, and by extension, penalties for your constituents.” 
Durrant highlighted two key budget requests for the judiciary, including $6 million in ongoing funds to train and retain courthouse staff and more money to fund eight district court judges, one juvenile court judge, four commissioners, and at least one if not two Court of Appeals judges. 
“These requests were made last year, but no new judges were allocated,” Durrant said, “which is why we return today with greater urgency.”

Durrant agreed that court decisions should come quicker — but that requires funding to help distribute the workload in the court system. 
“Today, our district courts operate in triage mode. We need your help to fix that,” he said. “Each of our (budget) requests is grounded in measured, fact-based workload data. Historically, we have received funding for less than one judicial position per year. Although we appreciate any funding previously provided, at that historical rate it would take 20 years to fill the current need for judicial officers in Utah.”
The governor, Senate president and House speaker are all supportive of a bill that would expand the Utah Supreme Court from five justices to seven. Durrant said “that, of course, is your prerogative.” 
“I ask only that you weigh the facts and understand the data you’ve been provided, just as we have in developing our requests,” he said. “If you elect to fund two new justices, please do not do it at the expense of the judicial positions we have prioritized.”

Durrant stressed that the need for more judges in the lower courts is “much greater” than it is in the Utah Supreme Court. 
Additionally, Durrant acknowledged that the judiciary’s institutions aren’t “perfect, and so yes, they can be improved.”
“But they are not the cesspools of corruption and self interest that some would have you believe,” he said. “They are largely composed of good and decent people who are genuine in their desire to serve well. That is true of Utah’s legislature. It is true of Utah’s judiciary.” 
However, in recent years, “we have witnessed a startling decrease in confidence in our public institutions,” he said, worrying it “threatens the core values” that have made the U.S. a “beacon of hope in the world.” 
“We should each strive to promote confidence in our governmental institutions,” he said, urging lawmakers to show respect for the judiciary even when they disagree with the courts. “There can and should be substantive disagreements, both within our respective institutions and between them. These disagreements are to be celebrated, and valid criticism should always be welcome.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)
But the “problem comes,” he said, “when we cross over from substantive disagreement to personal attack.” 
In recent months, many Republican lawmakers have accused the Utah Supreme Court and 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson — who has ruled against the Legislature several times in the state’s redistricting lawsuit — of “judicial activism.” Durrant urged lawmakers against those types of comments. 
“This erodes public confidence in our institutions. On those rare occasions when we strike down one of your statutes as unconstitutional, we carefully and dispassionately explain why,” he said. “You will never read an opinion where we challenge your integrity or good faith. I ask that you pay us the same courtesy in challenging our decisions.” 
He urged them to disagree “on the merits, not through impugning our integrity.” 
“I’m afraid ‘judicial activism’ has come to mean ‘a decision I disagree with,’” Durrant said. 
Saying it’s not court packing, governor supports expanding Utah’s appeals courts  

After Durrant’s speech, most lawmakers gave him a standing ovation. At least four, however, remained in their seats: House Majority Leader Casey Snider, R-Paradise; Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton; and Reps. Trevor Lee, R-Layton, and Matt MacPherson, R-West Valley City. 
Schultz told reporters he has “a lot of respect” for Durrant, and he acknowledged “we’ve got a lot of great judges.” 
“But there are some legitimate concerns out there,” Schultz said, adding that he’s supportive of an effort to increase “transparency” on judges by requiring the creation of a website that’s similar the the Legislature’s, “where every vote we make is public, every comment on the record we make is public.” 
“We want to find ways for the judicial branch to do the same thing,” he said. 
Senate Democrats say they plan to guard judiciary’s independence
In a media availability, Senate Democrats told reporters they are prioritizing guarding the judiciary’s independence this session. 
Sen. Stephanie Pitcher, D-Salt Lake City —  who is also an attorney and a member of the Senate Judiciary, Law Enforcement, and Criminal Justice Committee — said she isn’t necessarily opposed to the concept of adding two more justices to the Utah Supreme Court, but she said she opposes the timing of the effort.

“I think, with the position that we’re at right now with redistricting and all of the litigation that’s gone through, I think it is a pretty clear attempt to sway the ideology of the Supreme Court at a really critical time in that litigation process,” Pitcher said.
Pitcher also called the argument of expanding the high court to address workload issues “largely pretextual.” 
“If you talk to the courts, that’s not what they’re saying they need. As an attorney myself, I have clients that are waiting over a year to get a jury trial because our district courts are just so backlogged,” she said. “And so I think right now, if the intent truly is to help the judiciary, then it’s not expanding the Supreme Court, it’s providing resources to lower courts.”
Schultz and Adams have said they’re both supportive of expanding the Utah Supreme Court to bring it in line with other similarly-sized states — but they’re also supportive of expanding the other courts, too. It remains to be seen how much lawmakers will budget for the efforts. 
Schultz said he agrees that the judicial branch should be independent, while also calling for more accountability and transparency around judges that are bad actors. 
“We will follow the Constitution in trying to work to make the judicial branch more transparent,” he said. “We want to do so collaboratively with the judicial branch. We’re hoping they’re willing to work together with us on these things. But we’ll see.”

Outside was busy traffic on State Street and South Temple. Inside was gridlock that eased up for a time, only to return, Utah’s chief negotiator, Gene Shawcroft said Tuesday of last week’s meetings.
The states moved forward on a deal for two-and-a-half days, then went back by almost as far as they’d come, Shawcroft said. 
“I would just tell you that four days is too long. We got tired of each other,” he said. 
Shawcroft reiterated Tuesday what he and his counterparts from the other Colorado River states have said in recent months: They don’t have a deal, but they do have a commitment to keep talking and meet their upcoming February deadline. 
The earlier goal was to reach a 20-year deal, but Shawcroft told Utah News Dispatch the states are now working on an agreement for a shorter time frame. 
“I think it’ll be fairly simple, but I think it’ll allow us to operate for the next five years,” Shawcroft said.  
The river provides water to 40 million people across the U.S. and Mexico, contributing 27% of Utah’s water supply. It is shrinking because of drought, overuse and hotter temperatures tied to climate change.

Time for negotiators is also drying up as a Feb. 14 deadline set by the federal government approaches. The current agreement runs through late 2026.
The four Upper Basin states — Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming — are at odds with the Lower Basin states of Nevada, Arizona and California.
The upstream states don’t want to make mandatory cuts in dry years, saying they typically use much less than they’re allocated. The downstream states say all seven need to absorb cuts in difficult years.
Conservation groups have criticized the states for not reaching a deal yet, saying “escalating risks” — including declining storage in lakes Powell and Mead — are piling up every month they fail to agree on a plan.

The debate centers in part on upstream reservoirs like Flaming Gorge on the Utah-Wyoming border and whether they’ll be managed under the new plan. 
“Lower Basin believes those reservoirs ought to be used at the beck and call of the lower basin to reduce their reductions,” Shawcroft said at the meeting. “Obviously, we think differently.” 
Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, for her part, has criticized the upstream states’ “extreme negotiating posture,” saying they refuse to participate in any sharing in managing water shortages. 
Demand for water is outpacing the river’s supply, and extended dry periods aren’t helping. At the meeting, board members viewed a map covered in yellow, orange and red, noting the entire Colorado River watershed is experiencing some level of drought. 
Earlier this month, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the federal agency that oversees water in the West, released five options for a framework on managing the river’s biggest reservoirs, Lake Mead in Nevada and Lake Powell on the Utah-Arizona line.
Amy Haas, executive director of the Colorado River Authority of Utah, said she and her colleagues were still reviewing the 1,600-page document but one thing is clear.  
“None of the five can provide what for Utah is really the central consideration for the deal, and that is a waiver of compact litigation,” Haas said. 
States can sacrifice more than just time and money in lawsuits over water use. In Texas, similar litigation gave the federal government more leverage in negotiations. 
One of the Bureau of Reclamation’s plans would have Nevada, Arizona and California face potential water shortages. It could go into effect next year if the seven states don’t reach a deal.  
“The river and the 40 million people who depend on it cannot wait,” Andrea Travnicek, assistant interior secretary for water and science, said in a Jan. 9 statement announcing the five alternatives. “In the face of an ongoing severe drought, inaction is not an option.”

But legislators also set out new education priorities with 10 bills filed ahead of the session on issues ranging from homeschool student testing and district budgeting to curriculums and student safety. 
Lawmakers will also face new state budget pressures with fluctuating oil revenues. Gov. Mike Dunleavy has announced he is dropping efforts to push his education policy changes this year, which indicates he may be less invested in lawmakers’ education priorities than last year. 
Here’s a look at new education bills filed in the Alaska House and Senate. 
House Bill 248, sponsored by Rep. Alyse Galvin, I-Achorage, would require all school districts’ homeschool programs to maintain a testing participation rate that meets or exceeds neighborhood schools’ participation rates — that’s the number of students completing statewide academic testing. If the district fails to do so, the state will withhold funding from homeschool programs until they comply.
“The idea is to just level the playing field,” said Galvin in an interview. “So the public can have a better sense of accountability for the public dollars that are being spent in education, both in a brick-and-mortar school and in homeschools.”
Current state law allows homeschool parents or guardians to opt their student out of taking statewide assessments, and the process for opting out varies by district. Statewide, just 14.6% of homeschool students participated in the state’s standard assessment for math last year, while 80% of students in district schools participated, according to the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development.  
House Bill 261, sponsored by Rep. Andi Story, D-Juneau, would redefine how school districts calculate their student count in order to create budget estimates in the spring — districts could take the three year average of their student count or the previous year’s count, whichever is greater.
“It’s to get off the roller coaster to do a smart budgeting process,” Story said in an interview. 
Currently districts estimate their student count, create a rough budget projection and then make necessary changes with the state’s October count and adjust their budgets. The bill would give districts a solid number to budget off of for the year instead, Story said. “We won’t have to spend so much time redoing budgets, and we can spend more time on student achievement,” she said, and hopes it would also help districts be able to offer contracts early in the year and help retain teachers. 
The bill would also require districts to report the number of students in need of special education services, and it outlines a variety of changes related to how the state funds early education, school construction projects and state boarding schools. 
House Bill 237, sponsored by Rep. Jubilee Underwood, R-Wasilla, aims to improve statewide math curriculums, instruction and student proficiency. The bill would require math assessments, establish a program for teachers’ professional development and training and require schools to create math improvement plans and maintain communication with families to boost student achievement. 
House Bill 240, sponsored by Rep. David Nelson, R-Anchorage, would require all Alaska school districts to adopt a digital harassment policy to address and prohibit harassment online and particularly “nonconsensual digital impersonation.” That means a video or audio representation of an individual that misrepresents their appearance, speech or behavior; is likely deceptive to a viewer and is created without consent. The bill would require teacher and staff training on harassment, require districts to report all incidents to the state and require districts to ensure there is no retaliation for reporting such harassment. 
House Bill 256, sponsored by Rep. Will Stapp, R-Fairbanks, would create additional state funding for districts where 75% or more of schools are designated with a purple star award for their commitment to military students and families. It aims to boost districts’ support for students, and would require schools to designate accommodations for students transferring into schools, establish a state council on educational opportunities for military children and fund a new coordinator position within DEED dedicated to supporting the purple star award process. 
State funding for the special education agency would see a boost under House Bill 246, sponsored by Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage. It would increase additional funding for students with special education needs to $26.89 per student in the average daily membership count, from its current rate of $23.13 per student.
Senate Bill 206, by Sen. Loki Tobin, D-Anchorage, would require school employees, students or volunteers who have witnessed student bullying, harassment or intimidation be required to report not only to the district, but also to child advocacy centers. Child advocacy centers are located across the state, and provide resources and personnel to respond to child abuse. Districts would also have to notify parents or guardians and provide resources, including suicide prevention resources. The bill would also create a new state grant fund for safe firearm storage devices to provide to districts to make available to families in need. 
Tobin also introduced Senate Bill 210, which would require all educational institutions work cooperatively with local tribes in developing educational goals to include information on the cultural heritage and unique contributions of Alaska Natives and American Indians, especially in Alaska, and require school personnel to have awareness and understanding of Alaska Native and American Indian tribes to help relate to students and parents. 
Senate Bill 209, sponsored by Sen. Jesse Bjorkman, R-Soldotna, would add social studies competency to high school graduation requirements, which would include “civics, the history of the United States and state history.” The bill would require DEED to develop state testing requirements for proficiency in economics, language arts, math, science and social studies for grades eight, 10 and 12. Currently lawmakers are considering a pair of bills related to civics instruction including that would add civics curriculums to state schools and create civics project-based assessments.    
Senate Bill 204, sponsored by Sen. Mike Cronk, R-Tok, would allow school board members to be employed as substitute teachers. It would also disqualify candidates for school board who have been convicted of a state or federal felony crime.
Many other education related bills introduced last year will be up for debate in the Alaska House and Senate, ranging from tribal compacting to free school meals and a new state student loan program. 
The bills were introduced in the House and Senate on the first day of the session and assigned to be heard and debated in respective education committees in the coming weeks.

(File/Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Income and property taxes could both go down for some South Carolina residents next year under dual bills advanced out of a Senate committee Tuesday.
The Senate Finance Committee made no changes to a bill the House passed last year slicing the state’s income tax for some residents, with the goal of eventually doing away with the tax altogether. Senators saw the House’s proposal and raised them another tax cut, this time to the property taxes of people 65 and older who’ve lived in their home for at least five years.
“You can’t out-cut Harvey Peeler,” Peeler, the Senate’s head budget writer, told reporters soon after the vote, repeating his common catchphrase.
Senators agree with the House’s plan to eventually take the state’s income tax rate down to 0%, but property taxes have been a bigger complaint, especially from older homeowners, Peeler said.
“That’s what we’ve heard so much from our constituents,” the Gaffney Republican said. “All of it’s too high, but the property tax is unfair.”
Altogether, the bills would reduce state revenue by about $378 million for the fiscal year starting July 1. In both cases, the main opposition the bills faced Tuesday came from concerns they didn’t go far enough.
The state’s fiscal advisers expect economic growth to provide an additional $734 million in the fiscal year starting July 1, according to their latest predictions. Any tax-cutting plan would reduce that amount. Legislators also have a $1.7 billion surplus available on top of that from above-expected tax collections and unspent reserves in prior years, but that’s meant for one-time expenses.
State agencies and colleges are collectively seeking far more than the combined $2.5 billion. Peeler didn’t give any hints on which requests for the additional dollars might not get funded.
“I’m ready to go to work,” Peeler said. “That’s all I can say.”
Property tax cut
Property taxes don’t go to the state. They’re collected by counties for local government services. The proposal requires the state to reimburse counties an estimated $259 million additional for what’s called the Homestead Exemption.
Since 2000, homeowners who are 65 and older, blind, or are permanently disabled haven’t paid property taxes on the first $50,000 of their home’s value.
The bill advanced to the Senate floor would triple that tax break to $150,000 while also increasing the residency requirement. To qualify, homeowners must have lived in their house for five years, up from one.
The additional time is meant to ensure people don’t move into the state just to take advantage of the tax break, said Sen. Greg Hembree of fast-growing Horry County.
People are “moving in from out of state, and day one, they get the benefit of this exemption without having to put the first cent toward the building up of our communities,” the Little River Republican said. “They’re benefiting from those that have been here for many, many years paying these fees.”
However, homeowners who already qualify for the tax break under the one-year requirement would continue to get it under the proposal.
Initially, the bill lowered the qualifying age threshold to 60 and doubled the break to $100,000. Senators opted to maintain the age requirement in state law and instead increase the non-taxed value of a home. Hembree, who proposed the change, said that would help homeowners who most need it.
Sen. Tom Corbin disagreed. Even though many people aged 60 to 65 are still working, they need the help just as much, if not more, than their older counterparts, Corbin said. A lower amount combined with a lower age limit could help more people, said the Greenville County Republican.
“We’re giving more breaks to the people who we’ve already been giving a break to,” Corbin said.
Corbin was one of two senators to vote against the bill. Sen. Sean Bennett, R-Summerville, was the other. The other 19 senators at the meeting voted in favor.
Income tax cut
A bill that would immediately cut income taxes for nearly 40% of residents and make the state’s income tax appear more appealing to people moving from out of state also advanced Tuesday.
South Carolina’s top marginal income tax rate of 6% is the highest in the Southeast. But the effective rate — what people actually pay on average — is about half that. Still, Republicans in the House contended the state needed to decrease that top tax bracket to keep attracting companies and their executives.
The House approved the bill at the end of the legislative session last year, following an initial version that would have raised taxes for about 60% of filers. Under the bill senators advanced Tuesday, about 27% of people would pay more, and 35% would pay the same.
Sen. Wes Climer, a Rock Hill Republican, criticized the plan for not going far enough. No one’s taxes should go up as a result of what is advertised as a tax cut, said Climer, who is also running for Congress.
That’s not possible, said Bennett, a financial planner. Many of the people who will see their taxes increase under the bill were paying no income tax at all, so any change will inherently raise their taxes, Bennett said.
About 45% of tax filers pay zero state income taxes, according to the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
“The truth is, a lot of taxpayers for a long, long time have been getting a pretty sweetheart deal while others in our communities have been covering for them,” Bennett said.
In its first year, the bill would reduce state revenues by about $119 million, according to an updated financial analysis.
The income tax would continue to decrease incrementally until it hit 0%, as long as state revenues from other taxes grow enough to hit the triggers defined in the bill. The same triggers would continue collapsing the state’s tax rates — from three to two, and then to a single flat rate — before eventual elimination.
Along with reducing taxes overall, the bill decouples the state’s income tax code from the federal system. South Carolina is one of just five states to base state income taxes off “federal taxable income,” rather than adjusted gross income. That’s why South Carolina’s tax rate looks so out of whack compared to others in the Southeast.
Legislators say South Carolina should set its own tax rules instead of staying beholden to any changes Congress makes.
“That’s a significant issue, because it does allow South Carolina to create its own tax policy, which I think is critically important to the future of South Carolina,” Bennett said.
Decoupling means the federal income tax reductions in the massive tax package signed by President Donald Trump last July won’t extend to state income taxes.
Sen. Ronnie Sabb was the only senator to vote against the bill. He didn’t oppose the idea of a tax cut but felt the specifics of the bill needed more discussion, he said after the vote, without giving details on what he wanted to see change.

Larry Hogan (R) announced Tuesday, via an op-ed in The Baltimore Sun, that he will not challenge Gov. Wes Moore (D) for the governor’s mansion this fall.
In fact, Hogan declared he has “no intention of running for office again,” meaning his stunning political ascent, as a twice-elected Republican in a deep blue state, may be coming to an end.
In the piece, Hogan said he’s been “humbled” by calls from Marylanders urging him to run for governor a third time.
“Our eight years proved that Maryland is best served by leaders who understand that no one has a monopoly on good ideas,” Hogan wrote. “To my fellow Republicans: It is time to invest in a new generation of candidates who are ready to step up.”
A number of Republicans have already filed for the governor’s race, with others either running campaigns already or considering a bid. But none of them have the high profile of Hogan.
Moore’s campaign declined to comment on the development Tuesday, but it’s likely they are “breathing a sigh of relief,” said Todd Eberly, political science professor at St. Mary’s College of Maryland.
“It’s hard to imagine any Republican candidate being able to raise the amount of money that Hogan could,” Eberly said.
Poll: Moore approval numbers continue downward trend even as most voters would OK second term

Additionally, few, if any, Maryland Republicans who could run for the seat enjoy the kind of statewide name recognition that Hogan possesses, Eberly said. Maybe former Gov. Bob Ehrlich, who served from 2003 to 2007? Hardly any other names come to mind, Eberly said.
Meanwhile, the candidate filing deadline, on Feb. 24, is fast approaching.
“If you do not have the name recognition of a Larry Hogan, you’ve got to get into this now — sooner rather than later,” Eberly said.
That list includes Senate Majority Leader Steve Hershey (R- Upper Shore), who has explored running, but isn’t as well known as the two former Republican governors, Eberly said.
Hershey said Tuesday that he is “still thoughtfully considering what role I can play to help move our state in the right direction.”
“Maryland is facing serious budget and energy challenges that cannot be ignored, and it is clear we need fiscally responsible leadership to restore affordability, stability, and accountability,” Hershey said. “Any decision I make will be guided by what I believe is best for Maryland’s future.”
For the field of lesser-known hopefuls already in the race, Hogan’s announcement was welcome.
“This moment marks another important step on my journey toward the governorship,” wrote Ed Hale, a Baltimore businessman and owner of the Baltimore Blast indoor soccer team, who switched his affiliation from Democrat to Republican to run against Moore.
“I believe Maryland deserves steady leadership, fiscal responsibility, and a government that puts taxpayers first. I am committed to doing my very best for the people of this great state. Help is on the Way!” Hale wrote.
John Myrick, a Republican candidate for governor, wrote that he agrees with Hogan’s comments that “Maryland needs to look to the future, not the past.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“New leadership is needed.  Our next Lt. Governor, Dr. Brenda J. Thiam, and I look forward to restoring prosperity to Maryland once elected in November 2026,” Myrick wrote. “We thank Governor Hogan for leaving Maryland in a strong fiscal position — an advantage squandered by the current Governor.”
But the race will be exceedingly difficult for Republicans, who must surmount President Donald Trump’s (R) low approval ratings in the state, Eberly said.
Democrats’ insistence that they will not raise taxes during the current General Assembly session may make the road even more challenging for the GOP, he said.
“It increasingly allows this to be a referendum on Donald Trump and his leadership of the country, nationalizing what otherwise would be a Maryland race,” Eberly said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_june24_hogan-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 20:57:20.128666

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
An attorney for the only defendant yet to face a criminal trial in the seemingly never-ending Mississippi welfare fraud case has asked a federal judge for a mistrial after the team’s lead lawyer fell ill last week. 
The trial for Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr. was in the middle of its second week when the lead defense attorney, Scott Gilbert, experienced a health issue halfway through the day Jan. 14. Gilbert was in the middle of cross examining former Mississippi Department of Human Services Director John Davis – the former director’s fourth day on the witness stand – but never faltered in his questions before court stopped for a lunch break.

U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves did not immediately make a decision Tuesday on how to proceed with the case, opting to ask each juror whether they are available in February and how a pause in the trial may affect them. He said he will make a ruling on the motion for a mistrial shortly. If granted, the parties acknowledged that a new trial would be scheduled, possibly several months from now.
DiBiase is facing 13 criminal counts including conspiracy, wire fraud, theft of federal funds and money laundering in a broader alleged scheme to raid the state’s federal public assistance agency. He received roughly $3 million in federal funds from the agency through what prosecutors call  “sham contracts,” while DiBiase argues he was a lawful contractor. 
Another lawyer added to DiBiase’s defense shortly before trial, Eric Herschmann, made the case for a mistrial. 
He argued that DiBiase has a constitutional right to choose his own counsel and that the defendant has been working with Gilbert for nearly six years. The federal government first moved to seize DiBiase’s million-dollar Madison mansion – which it alleges was purchased with welfare funds – in 2020, though he was not indicted until 2023.
Herschmann said DiBiase chose well by selecting Gilbert.
“Mr. Gilbert’s cross examination of the government’s star witness was so outstanding that in the midst of the cross examination, the government indicated it was going to treat the star witness as a hostile witness on redirect,” Herschmann said.
When a party to a case treats its own witness as hostile, it generally means the witness gave testimony that was unfavorable or unexpected to that party’s case, and in turn, counsel may use strategies to get the witness to contradict or even impeach himself or herself on the stand.
Herschmann was referring to Davis. The prosecution first called Davis on Jan. 9 in its effort to build a case – using many long, sentimental text messages between Davis and DiBiase – alleging the wrestler ingratiated himself with the then-welfare director in an attempt to strike it rich off the federal public assistance program. 
The defense began questioning Davis on Jan. 12, displaying documents and social media posts to assert that DiBiase intended to carry out the services he was contracted to provide. Davis’ testimony supported many of Gilbert’s points, such as the fact that the men did not try to conceal what they were doing.

Herschmann told the judge Tuesday that he observed Gilbert’s condition during trial last week and recommended the team take a break. He said Gilbert soon visited a hospital. Herschmann said the team doesn’t expect to learn more about Gilbert’s outlook for roughly four weeks.
DiBiase is also represented by Sidney Lampton, whom Herschmann argued does not have the jury trial experience required to lead the case. Only Gilbert currently has the experience and knowledge to adequately lead the case that involves 6 million pages of records, Herschmann argued. He said preparing a new attorney could take months.
The government argued against the request for mistrial, saying DiBiase’s remaining lawyers are capable of trying the case and delays could jeopardize the testimony if witnesses become unavailable. It was divulged that Davis, for example, is currently undergoing treatment for cancer.
Herschmann, a former senior advisor to President Donald Trump, is involved in the Mississippi welfare fraud case by way of former NFL quarterback Brett Favre. 
Herschmann is representing Favre in a broader civil case that the state welfare department is bringing against dozens of people or entities that improperly doled out or received federal funds. Favre has not been charged criminally.
That litigation has dragged on since 2022. In recent months, Herschmann and the lawyers for other defendants in the case took a deposition from a former deputy state auditor, Stephanie Palmertree, who conducted the original audit exposing the misspending. There is a gag order in the civil case that many parties to that litigation have said prevents them from speaking to the media about the case. 
Palmertree left the auditor’s office to form her own accounting and consulting firm in early 2024 and DHS hired Palmertree in her new capacity to be the expert witness in the civil suit. After the deposition, and just before DiBiase’s trial, DHS filed to withdraw her as its expert witness. 
Herschmann said during his argument Tuesday that he, in Gilbert’s recent absence, worked throughout the weekend to sift through discovery in the DiBiase case.
He alleged he found conflicting information within the materials, such as transcripts, produced in the criminal case, which he recently joined, versus the civil case he’s been immersed in for years.
Without any more detail, and referring to Palmertree, Herschmann said, “She swore under oath that she fabricated evidence to the federal government.” 
In the DiBiase trial, Herschmann was expected to call Palmertree to the stand to question her handling of the audit – a long point of contention for Favre’s camp. Favre has denied the auditor’s office’s claim that Favre entered an agreement to give speeches in exchange for $1.1 million in payments from a nonprofit at the center of the scandal. Mississippi Today obtained and analyzed the agreement in 2022.
Palmertree’s attorney Melvin Priester Jr. said that because Palmertree has been called as a witness in the case, she cannot comment on Herschmann’s remarks other than that she stands by her audit.
“Any implication that she has somehow made a material misrepresentation is a mischaracterization of the evidence,” Priester said.
Herschmann also said the auditor’s office had admitted to destroying recordings. He suggested to Reeves that the criminal case requires a probe into these matters. 
Reeves asked the lawyer why this type of analysis hadn’t been conducted in DiBiase’s case up to this point. Herschmann said another lawyer is representing DiBiase in the civil case and the attorney had not requested a transcript of Palmertree’s deposition.
Reached for comment, auditor’s office spokesperson Jacob Walters said in a text, “OSA does everything by the book and Eric Herschmann will say anything to deflect from the fact that millions of dollars in welfare funds were misspent.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/06163106/ted-dibiase.png,,,2026-01-20 20:57:20.128666

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderGeorgia’s economy is showing signs of strength, but persistent inflation and slow job and wage growth have left consumers feeling sour about their finances. 
And the state economist, Robert Buschman, told lawmakers Tuesday that he expects that slow growth and higher inflation to continue. 
Buschman’s presentation to legislative budget writers put charts and graphs to the unease lawmakers are hearing from their constituents back home as affordability concerns take center stage under the Gold Dome. 
“Reluctance by businesses to hire suggests fewer opportunities to change jobs for better pay, and that those between jobs or entering the workforce will remain unemployed for longer, dragging on consumer confidence,” Buschman said. 
“Consumers also still feel squeezed by inflation. Incomes have not really kept up for the average worker. So consumer sentiment is weak,” he said. 
Inflation had been falling from the recent highs seen in 2022 but has crept back up to 2.7%. 
Buschman highlighted some bright spots for Georgia’s economy, like its low unemployment rate. But he said there are also worry-inducing factors at play, like the tariffs that have become a central element of President Donald Trump’s economic policy in his second term in office. Trump has issued new tariff threats in recent days in his pursuit of Greenland. 
The bulk of the cost of these tariffs fall on consumers and businesses, depending on much of the cost companies are willing to absorb to avoid losing sales in the short term, Buschman said. 
“As time passes, businesses, both domestic and foreign, have to pass more of the cost on to consumers to remain profitable, so we’ll see continuing upward pressure on consumer prices,” he said. 
There’s also the risk of other countries placing retaliatory tariffs on American exports. 
“Large exporting states like Georgia are the ones harmed the most by that,” Buschman said, noting that Georgia is the 12th largest export state. 
Buschman’s presentation was part of the kick-off for this week’s budget hearings at the state Capitol. The hearings continue Wednesday morning with agency heads who oversee social and health care services in Georgia.  
The state economist’s outlook also provides context for the words of caution Gov. Brian Kemp has been weaving into his public comments on the budget. As he wraps up his last year in office, the governor has been touting his administration’s conservative approach to the budget.

“It has allowed us to store up strategic reserves for the next economic downturn, ensuring you all or future legislators won’t be forced to cut critical services for Georgians when, not if, the next economic crisis hits,” Kemp said to lawmakers Tuesday. 
Kemp has proposed accelerating another incremental income tax rate decrease at a time when some legislative leaders are pushing for more aggressive steps toward eliminating it entirely. He has proposed cutting the rate to 4.99%, down from today’s 5.19%, and built his budget proposals on the assumption those revenues will be foregone. The already-planned cuts would happen three years faster than originally planned. 
He’s also proposing another round of bonus tax refunds for this year, paid for by funds from the state’s $14.6 billion reserves. With those payments to taxpayers and one-time infrastructure spending boosts, the state is still set to have about $10 billion left in reserves when Kemp leaves office next January. 
Buschman, who was appointed by Kemp, expressed skepticism about talk of eliminating the state’s income tax. A special Senate committee unveiled a plan earlier this month that would end the tax by 2032. 
“I think what the governor has been doing in lowering income tax rates slowly over time, as we were able to evaluate how much of our surpluses were structural surpluses, is the better way to go,” he said. 
Kemp told reporters Tuesday that he is optimistic about Georgia’s ability to weather any economic storms that may await. 
“We have been cautiously budgeting since we came out of the pandemic, because nobody really knew what this was going to look like,” he said. “So we’re prepared to deal with what’s going on in the world right now.”
It was also announced Tuesday that Kemp and first lady Marty Kemp would lead an economic development mission this week to Belgium and the United Kingdom. He will be there at a time of rising tensions between the Trump administration and America’s allies. 
“We cannot rest on our laurels. We’ve got to finish strong. We’ve got to keep finding people that want to grow jobs in our state so, God forbid, if somebody does lose their job, they’ve got other opportunities that pay just as well or better,” he said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1130240-scaled-e1768928913891-1024x794.jpg,,,2026-01-20 20:57:20.128666

(Photo courtesy of campaign)Democrat Garrett McGuire on Tuesday defeated Republican Christopher Cardiff in a special election to represent Virginia House of Delegates District 17, filling the vacancy left by longtime Democratic lawmaker Mark Sickles, who has joined Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s administration as secretary of finance.
By 8 p.m., McGuire led Cardiff with 80.4-19.5% out of 4,360 votes cast, according to unofficial results from the Virginia Department of Elections.
The victory allows Democrats to retain the Fairfax County–based seat, which has been reliably blue in recent election cycles and includes parts of Franconia, Rose Hill and surrounding communities. 
McGuire will serve the remainder of Sickles’ term, which runs through 2027. He is expected to be sworn in in the coming days. 
Sickles, a Democrat first elected to the House in 2003, stepped down late last year after Spanberger tapped him to lead the state’s finance portfolio, a move that triggered the special election. 
His departure was one of several that have reshaped the House since Democrats regained control of the chamber, as multiple lawmakers have left to join the new administration or pursue higher office.
In a statement Tuesday night, House Democrats praised McGuire’s win. 
“We’re excited to welcome Garrett to the House Democratic Caucus and to work alongside him to deliver a Virginia that lowers costs for families, keeps our communities safe, and stands firm against (President Donald) Trump’s attacks on Virginians’ rights and freedoms,” the caucus said.
McGuire, a longtime Fairfax County public policy professional and community leader, has chaired the board of United Community — the largest nonprofit serving the Route 1 corridor — and previously led the Fairfax-Falls Church Community Services Board, where he helped steer mental health and disability services through the COVID-19 pandemic and a major staffing shortage, his campaign biography says.
District 17 has favored Democrats by comfortable margins in recent statewide races. According to the Virginia Public Access Project, the district supported Democratic nominees for governor, attorney general and lieutenant governor in the most recent general election, and Democrats hold a significant edge in voter registration.
Tuesday’s contest marks the latest in a series of special elections prompted by turnover in the Democratic caucus. 
Earlier this month, Democrats held onto House Districts 11 and 23 in Northern Virginia, and retained two Richmond-area seats after incumbents exited the chamber. 
Those wins have helped Democrats maintain their comfortable majority as the 2026 General Assembly session gets underway.
With McGuire’s victory, attention now turns to the final special election on the calendar, a Feb. 10 contest in Senate District 39 in Northern Virginia. 
Democratic Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker of Alexandria will face Republican Julie Lineberry to fill the vacancy left by Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, who joined Spanberger’s administration as a senior adviser at the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority. 
If Bennett-Parker prevails, Democrats would continue to hold their narrow control of the Senate as Spanberger begins her first legislative session with a friendly General Assembly and an agenda focused on affordability, health care and reproductive rights.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A proposal to save a community hospital is among seven bills North Dakota legislative leaders advanced Tuesday for consideration during a special session.
Although the session that starts Wednesday is focused on federal Rural Health Transformation Program money, legislative leaders discussed 19 additional bill drafts.
Legislative leaders rejected a majority of the proposals, but voted unanimously to advance a bill drafted in response to the financial woes of Jacobson Memorial Hospital, the critical access hospital in Elgin.
Rural hospital on the verge of shutting down could be saved by lawmaker’s bill

The facility, which serves surrounding southwest North Dakota communities, is in danger of closing its doors, said Sen. Donald Schaible, R-Mott, the primary bill sponsor.
“We normally could wait for a regular session to introduce such a bill. But unfortunately, the Jacobson Memorial Hospital may not be able to survive until a regular session,” Schaible said. “They truly need our help.”
The bill would appropriate $10 million for emergency low-interest operating loans, to be administered by the Bank of North Dakota under an existing program, to hospitals in danger of shutting down in the state. 
The bill was assigned to the Joint Appropriations Committee for the three-day special session that will begin Wednesday. 
The committee also advanced two bills that relate to free school meals, proposals that are in response to a proposed constitutional ballot measure that’s circulating.
Property taxes
Lawmakers will consider a property tax bill that sponsor Rep. Craig Headland, R-Montpelier, says will clarify how the primary residence tax credit is applied.
Under legislation approved last year, homeowners are eligible for a property tax credit of up to $1,600 per year.
But the way counties are calculating that tax credit is diluting a 5% discount homeowners can receive for paying their property taxes early.
2 options for free school meals head to North Dakota special session

Headland’s bill would change how the early-pay discount is applied. Under his proposal, a homeowner could save up to $80 more per year.
The fiscal impact of the bill was not immediately clear. Counties factor in the early-pay discount into their budgets, ultimately assessing that discount back to the taxpayers.
Other approved bill drafts
Lawmakers approved a proposal from Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, to set aside $325,000 for litigation funding for the Public Service Commission and $1.5 million for North Dakota Information Technology to bring state websites and other digital content into compliance with American Disability Act requirements.
The committee also voted to forward a bill brought by Rep. Mark Sanford and Sen. Jonathan Sickler, both Republicans from Grand Forks, to authorize the University of North Dakota to use  money from a land sale for construction projects at the Ray Richards golf course or to support the school’s varsity golf teams.
What to know about North Dakota’s special legislative session

The committee also advanced a resolution brought by Rep. Glenn Bosch, R-Bismarck, celebrating the 175th anniversary of the YMCA.
The legislative committee rejected proposals that relate to redistricting, funding for Highway Patrol firearms and firefighter benefits.
The special session is scheduled to last three days but could last longer if lawmakers choose.
Lawmakers during a special session generally only consider bills related to the reason the session was called, though it’s up to the discretion of Legislative Management, a committee of legislative leaders, to accept additional proposals. 
Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, said during Tuesday’s Legislative Management meeting he has concerns that approving bills that fall outside the original purpose of the session will set a precedent.
“I frequently hear, ‘Well, you did it for them, now do it for me,’ and I don’t know how we stop that train,” he said.
Sen. Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden, said the shorter timeline of special sessions means there’s a risk that legislation will not be reviewed with the same rigor as regular sessions.
“We are kind of rushing,” Klein said. 
Each bill will receive a public hearing, but the public will have a short window to provide comment. A hearing schedule and links to submit written testimony are available on the Legislature’s website.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Two bills that would address free or reduced school meals for North Dakota students will be considered by state lawmakers this week.
One bill, sponsored by Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, would mandate the state cover the cost for free school meals for K-12 students and mirrors a constitutional ballot measure. The Together for School Meals coalition is gathering signatures to put the issue to a statewide vote in November.
While the ballot measure would add the meal program to the state constitution, the bill would add the program to state law, making it easier for lawmakers to adjust if the program becomes too costly.
“We have talked to the supporters of the initiated measure and they are in full support of this bill,” Nathe said during the meeting. 
The bill advanced on a 14-3 vote of Legislative Management for consideration in the special session that begins Wednesday. 
Nathe’s free school meals bill is expected to cost $65 million for the 2026-27 school year, according to estimates by the Department of Public Instruction, and will be funded through the Strategic Investment and Improvements Fund.
“I think the ballot measure will pass,” said Gov. Kelly Armstrong in an interview Tuesday. “So, then the question becomes, do you want constitutionally mandated spending, or do you want it in legislation?”
During the meeting, Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, said she’s concerned the ballot measure process is being weaponized against lawmakers for policy considerations, and lawmakers shouldn’t be scared of protecting the state constitution.
“We are becoming a welfare state,” Myrdal said. “All of our kids in schools right now are fed. There are no hungry kids in school because we passed a law, even, to ensure that.”
A competing school lunch bill, sponsored by Rep. Ty Dressler, R-Richardton, was also advanced by the committee on a 14-3 vote and would expand the state’s current free and reduced school lunch program.
Dressler’s bill would expand the program to families earning up to 300% of the federal poverty level, which is about $96,000 for a family of four.
“I’m excited to present an alternative option,” Dressler said in an interview Tuesday. “I think it’s a good opportunity for voters to see there is more than one option instead of just passing the initiated measure.”
What to know about North Dakota’s special legislative session

He also said he wanted his bill to focus on the people who need the help.
“I think it’s a budget-friendly way of approaching an issue we can all believe in,” Dressler said.
During the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers expanded the free and reduced school lunch program to include households earning up to 225% of the federal poverty level, which is about $72,000 for a family of four. 
Armstrong said he hopes lawmakers don’t lose sight of the purpose of the special session which is to allocate $199 million in Rural Health Transformation Program funding for the state that was signed into law by President Donald Trump in July as part of the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado voters along the Front Range could decide on whether to approve a new tax this year to help fund passenger rail service between Fort Collins and Pueblo.
Sal Pace, the general manager of the state’s Front Range Passenger Rail District, told lawmakers on Tuesday that the agency wants to get prepared for a ballot measure, whether it happens this year or later on. It is a process that will require a lot of public engagement and feedback.
It’s the agency’s “statutory mandate to receive public input on our plans before we refer a ballot measure,” he said during a hearing with the state Legislature’s Transportation and Energy Committee. “It’s a results-oriented approach that prioritizes milestones and evaluation metrics before referring a potential ballot question.”

The rail district was created by the Legislature in 2021 to oversee the planning, financing, construction and eventual operation of a passenger rail service along the Interstate 25 corridor. The body has the power to refer a tax to voters, but it decided not to in 2024, partially due to scant details at the time on how the service would work. Polling from that year, however, showed strong support for a 0.5% sales tax increase.
Now, the service development plan is nearly complete, and a finalized operating plan and station plans are set to be drafted soon. That gives voters a better idea of what their tax dollars would pay for.
“When I was hired as the general manager of the Front Range Passenger Rail District — I think two months and 20 days ago — was with the direction to aim for a 2026 ballot measure,” Pace said. Pace is a former state representative and longtime rail advocate.
He said there is a multi-phased approach to whether the agency will put a question on the ballot. If it doesn’t meet its goals by the end of each phase, it will not continue to the next one.
“So we’ll have two inflection points in our process over the next 10 months to determine whether or not to continue to move forward,” he said. The first phase will focus on ensuring technical and financial readiness for service and the second phase will focus on engagement.
The rail district, which encompasses all or part of 13 counties along the I-25 corridor, will launch an online platform this month to get public feedback on its plans, Pace said, and it plans to host 30 town halls by the end of April. The agency is also exploring branding options. A mocked-up image from the slideshow Tuesday, for example, shows an orange train with “Broncos Express” emblazoned on the side, zooming past snowcapped mountains.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Representatives of Iowa’s private colleges pushed back Tuesday against the narrative that baccalaureate degrees are sorely needed at community colleges, with lawmakers responding that something must change.
A House higher education subcommittee moved House Study Bill 533 to committee after hearing from private and community college leaders. The bill would authorize the state’s community colleges to offer bachelor’s degree programs, as long as they correspond with high-demand, unmet workforce needs.
Higher Education Committee Chair Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, chaired the subcommittee and was joined by Rep. John Wills, R-Spirit Lake, and Rep. Timi Brown-Powers, D-Waterloo. Community Colleges for Iowa released reports last year detailing the potential pros and cons of adding bachelor’s degree programs to community college offerings and presented findings to the committee during its first meeting of the 2026 session.

Gary Steinke, president of the Iowa Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, told the subcommittee that if this bill passes, some of Iowa’s private colleges would close. If one of these entities does close, he said, it’s not just a bunch of buildings shutting down, but also the shutdown of jobs, health care and more for the community where it is housed.
“Private enterprise cannot compete with tax-supported institutions, entities, stores, businesses, or anything else,” Steinke said. “It can’t happen and the outcome will be bad, and that makes me very sad.”
Steinke said he didn’t come to the meeting to “chastise” Iowa’s community colleges, as “they do great work,” but he rejected the existence of education deserts and said he’s never seen numbers on underserved students in different geographic areas of the state. Private institutions “spend an unbelievable amount of time” trying to learn students’ wants and needs, he said.
Brian Lenzmeier, president of Buena Vista University in Storm Lake, said the private university has been serving students on community college campuses for just over 50 years. They’ve transitioned away from offering face-to-face instruction at most of the colleges in recent years not because they wanted to, he said, but because they were losing students to online institutions like Southern New Hampshire University or the University of Phoenix.
Lenzmeier pointed out one recent partnership announced by Hawkeye Community College in November, which entered into an agreement with Arizona State University. This partnership was not an investment in the state, he said, and he believes there isn’t a big market for face-to-face bachelor’s degrees at community colleges.
Colleges like Eastern Iowa Community Colleges and Iowa Central have private colleges close to them or their satellite locations, he said, offering bachelor’s degrees at no cost to the taxpayer. Iowans deserve to know what the total cost of implementation is going to be, Steinke said, as well as how many institutions will be involved and if there will be any issues with accreditation or articulation agreements.
Jim Obradovich, speaking on behalf of Faith Baptist Bible College in Ankeny, said during the meeting he shares Steinke’s concern over geography, as the college’s two biggest programs are teaching/education and nursing. If this bill were to pass, he said it would allow a community college located a few miles away to compete with these programs — “the ones they’ve invested a great deal in.”
“We just kind of struggle a little bit to see how allowing community colleges to offer four-year baccalaureate degrees is our best use of those finite education dollars we have in the state,” Obradovich said.
Community Colleges for Iowa Executive Director Emily Shields said private colleges concerned about these questions should refer to the reports released last year, which include definitions of education deserts and other data. She added she believes community colleges have talked to their students and understand accreditation policies, “and we believe there’s both a need and an opportunity.”
“We have no desire to compete with the private colleges or put any of them out of business,” Shields said. “In the 24 states where this has happened, no private colleges have closed because community colleges are offering bachelor’s degrees.”
No more status quo
Wills said during the subcommittee meeting he was a nontraditional student who decided to attend Iowa Lakes Community College to start and Northwestern College to finish his higher education. At the time, he would have chosen to attend the private university even if Iowa Lakes offered bachelor’s degrees, but that wouldn’t be the case now with time and other constraints.
Community colleges will target the students who don’t have different higher education options available to them, he said, and he’s saying “yes” to the bill to get at that population.
“This has all kinds of different aspects and I think it’s a great idea, and I think that we should do it,” Wills said.
Brown-Powers has two private colleges, one public university and one community college in her district, she said, and their feelings toward the legislation are mixed. She feels for students who are “code bound,” but she said she’s hesitant to support the bill because there is no funding mechanism included and she’s wary of rumors of barring certain community colleges from inclusion in the legislation.
After hearing feedback from the public and his fellow lawmakers, Collins said he understands where the opposition is coming from but “the status quo is not an option.” Collins said he’s open to the conversation of potentially limiting the scope of the bill, but those who want to see limitations implemented must “be willing to come up to the table and negotiate.”
Bringing bachelor’s degrees to community colleges is not a hypothetical, with nearly half of U.S. states committing to the idea in some form, he said, and a single mom working as an RN in Burlington and a paraeducator in Council Bluffs deserve to have these opportunities.
“I am willing to look at these additional guardrails, but you have to bring them to me,” Collins said. “Until then, we will continue to advance this bill. In fact, we will be advancing this bill out of committee next week at the very latest.”

Jared Polis in 2025 signs into law a bill that implements Amendment 79, a constitutional amendment that guarantees the right to abortion and lifts a prohibition on public funds for care. (Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)After Colorado voters in 2024 approved Amendment 79 to enshrine the right to abortion in the Colorado Constitution, people seeking abortion care in the state can have that care covered by Medicaid as of 2026. 
But the success of the amendment depends on whether coverage actually results in patients accessing affordable abortion care, according to leaders with Colorado-based reproductive rights group Cobalt. 
Adequate Medicaid reimbursement rates for abortion care providers will determine whether providers are actually able to serve patients covered by Medicaid, Kiera Hatton Sena, political director at Cobalt, said in a press call Tuesday. Clinics may have to limit the number of Medicaid recipients they can treat or opt out of Medicaid entirely.

“This is incredibly acute for abortion care where providers already face elevated security costs, workforce shortages, and administrative complex fees,” Hatton Sena said. “Coverage alone does not equal access. Without the reimbursement rates that reflect the very real cost of care, staff, clinical time, follow-up, compliance, infrastructure, Colorado risks creating a legal right that patients cannot practically use.”
The effect of Amendment 79 will be measured by outcomes, including provider participation, geographic coverage and wait times, Hatton Sena said. Access in rural Colorado will be key, given the fewer providers there and patients traveling longer distances for care, she added.
“How the state continues to implement abortion coverage will shape whether or not constitutional protections coexist within a safe functioning health care system,” Hatton Sena said. 
Cobalt does not have specific data on how many people have accessed abortion care in Colorado through Medicaid so far this year, but Melisa Hidalgo-Cuellar, director of the Cobalt Abortion Fund, said the organization has seen “a handful of clients” who have had abortion care covered by Medicaid.
“It did feel like that success, that this work … that we’re doing alongside providers, this work that we’re doing alongside other advocates, is actually supporting abortion seekers (getting) that time sensitive, essential health care that they need,” Hidalgo-Cuellar said.
The various laws Colorado has passed protecting access to abortion before and after the passage of Amendment 79 affirms that “abortion is health care,” Cobalt President Karen Middleton said. Coverage of abortion care by public insurance will be treated like any other health care need, she said, which is “moving Colorado forward and setting the stage as a national model for this work.”
Colorado lawmakers in 2023 passed a law requiring private insurers to cover abortion care. It went into effect at the start of 2025. 
State and local government employees can also have abortion care covered by their health insurance since Amendment 79 removed a 1984 state constitutional amendment that prohibited the use of public funds for abortion.
Affordability is one of the biggest barriers to accessing abortion care, Middleton said, so solidifying insurance coverage for everyone amid federal and state funding cuts is critical. 
Cobalt is working with clinics and providers to ensure they are set up to accept Medicaid. The Cobalt Abortion Fund supports logistical costs that arise for people seeking abortion care, Hidalgo-Cuellar said.

Jefferson Ghrist (R-Upper Shore) Tuesday. (Photo by Steve Crane/Maryland Matters)Rural areas account for much of the area of the state, but not for many of the  voters. And that’s been a problem for lawmakers from rural districts.
That’s why they hope the newly formed Rural Caucus can finally let their voices be heard in state policy debates.
“Too often, rural issues are overshadowed by policy debates that are driven primarily by population density, rather than the reality on the ground,” said Del. Jefferson Ghrist (R-Upper Shore), co-chair of the caucus that had its first formal meeting Tuesday.
“The purpose of the Rural Caucus is very simple: To ensure that rural Maryland is heard, is respected and is thoughtfully considered in the legislative process,” Ghrist said at a news conference with fellow caucus members, Agriculture Secretary Kevin Atticks and House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel). The speaker created the caucus in December as part of a commitment to House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) as she assumed the speakership this year.
Atticks said the concerns of rural areas of the state are not that different from suburban and urban areas, but “the solutions are not one size fits all.”
“This is a different venue for those discussions, and the commitment from this speaker is wildly important” to that process, Atticks said.
That was echoed by Ghrist.
“Rural communities share challenges which include access to health care and secure and affordable electricity. Our transportation needs are very different. Workforce shortages, agricultural sustainability, health and safety and the ability of local governments to comply with state mandates with very limited resources is a big priority for the rural caucus,” Ghrist said. “They’re not abstract concerns. They affect real people every single day.”
When she announced the caucus in December, Peña-Melnyk acknowledged that with so much of the House coming from “the urban and suburban center of our state, I know that Western Maryland, the Eastern Shore, and Southern Maryland are not always at the table.” She said then that her office would have a “direct relationship” with the caucus, which aims to “elevate their voice and ensure that they are heard.”
The eight-member caucus is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, who come from Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore — and Howard County, said Ghrist, adding that virtually every county in the state has rural areas.
The caucus co-chair, Del. Natalie Ziegler (D-Howard) “is from the majority party, and she owns a farm, she lives in a very rural part of Howard county,” Ghrist said. “There are rural communities in Montgomery, Howard, Charles, Anne Arundel, Baltimore and Prince George’s counties. That’s the point I want to make. I think the county that has the highest acreage that’s in ag preservation is Montgomery County.”
The caucus is scheduled to hold weekly virtual meetings for at least the next five weeks, with lawmakers invited to bring their bills in for caucus review.
“I want to be very clear: The Rural Caucus is not partisan. We’re not partisan, we’re not ideological. We are practical,” he said.
Ghrist said members of the caucus is not looking for “special consideration or special treatment. We’re asking for thoughtful consideration, meaningful representation and policies that recognize our unique circumstances and contributions to Maryland. With the formation of the House Rural Caucus, rural Maryland now has a seat at the table.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2007-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 19:56:54.748793

The call focuses on a $3.5 million water contract with lithium miners and the Budd-Falen’s role approving it as part of President Trump’s Interior Department.
The post Federal lawmakers call for investigation of Wyoming’s Budd-Falen for possible criminal, ethics violations appeared first on WyoFile .","Two members of Congress asked federal officials Tuesday to investigate Wyoming lawyer Karen Budd-Falen for possible criminal violations while serving in President Donald Trump’s Interior Department.
A letter from Reps. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., and Maxine Dexter, D-Ore., to the Interior Department’s acting inspector general cites “new evidence … that demands immediate investigation.”
The correspondence under the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources letterhead focuses on a water contract between Budd-Falen’s family ranch in Nevada, a lithium mining company and Interior Department approval of the Thacker Pass Lithium mine in that state.
Reps. Huffman and Dexter question whether Budd-Falen, the third-highest-ranking person at DOI, “used her position at the DOI for self-enrichment,” violated ethical standards and broke federal law. The committee members’ Tuesday letter to Acting DOI Inspector General Caryl Brzymialkiewicz alleges the Nevada Lithium Corporation’s $3.5 million water contract with Budd-Falen family’s Home Ranch in Nevada was contingent on federal Interior Department approval.
Ms. Budd-Falen’s financial interests and official activities may have implicated federal ethics and conflict-of-interest restrictions, and possibly violations of federal criminal law.” Jared Huffman and Maxine Dexter
The two representatives, citing reports by Public Domain, the New York Times and other sources, said Budd-Falen never disclosed that her family’s ranch in Nevada had inked a deal with the Nevada Lithium Corporation. Federal law and ethic rules require strict financial disclosures and reporting by political appointees like Budd-Falen.
“Recently uncovered evidence … raises … serious questions, including whether Ms. Budd-Falen’s financial interests and official activities may have implicated federal ethics and conflict-of-interest restrictions, and possibly violations of federal criminal law,” the letter states.
Huffman is the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee and represents California’s second district along the coast north of San Francisco. Dexter represents most of Portland, Oregon, and is the top Democrat on the committee’s oversight and investigations subcommittee.
Budd-Falen, a longtime Western conservative legal activist, served in the Interior Department during Trump’s first administration and was appointed in March as the agency’s associate deputy secretary. Between those periods of government service she worked at the Budd-Falen law office in Cheyenne.
Serious questions
The 12-page letter from the representatives documents a meeting between Budd-Falen and the Nevada Lithium Corporation at the Department of Interior during Trump’s first term. The letter also catalogs a series of actions between and among the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management and high-ranking Interior Department officials regarding mine approval.
The letter outlines how worries about environmental and wildlife protections — protections that could have stalled or blocked mine approval — were overridden by department officials.
“The record unequivocally reflects an official meeting between Ms. Budd-Falen and the Nevada Lithium Corporation scheduled during the pending federal review for the Thacker Pass lithium mine, combined with a continuing, multi-million-dollar financial interest tied to the project’s success,” the committee members wrote.
“These facts raise serious questions regarding Ms. Budd-Falen’s compliance with federal ethics and conflict-of-interest laws and warrant the immediate attention of your office….”
Huffman and Dexter acknowledge a shifting legal landscape in government, but draw a line.
“While the Supreme Court has given President Trump a virtual free pass to abuse the public’s trust to enrich himself, public corruption by those he installs in federal agencies is still unlawful,” their letter reads. Consequently, they asked the acting DOI inspector for several answers.
Among those are whether Budd-Falen’s ranching interests have been appropriately identified as she works on grazing issues for the administration and whether she was required to disclose the $3.5 million deal between her family ranch in Nevada and the mining company.
They want to know whether family business structures obscured the relationships between and among Budd-Falen, the family ranch and the mining company and whether she used her official position to influence federal policy and action regarding mine approval.
The letter seeks an answer to whether officials sidelined objections of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding the mine and whether any actions by officials “were intended to delay, frustrate, or limit congressional oversight or public disclosure.”
The White House on Tuesday referred questions to the Department of the Interior. The Interior Department did not respond to an email seeking comment.
U.S. Sen. John Barrasso’s office did not respond to a Tuesday email seeking comment. WyoFile did not receive a response to an email on the topic sent to U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis’s office. Rep. Harriet Hageman’s office also did not respond to an email Tuesday.
A conservation group, however, called for Budd-Falen’s suspension.
“At the very least, Secretary Burgum must suspend Karen Budd-Falen pending the outcome of any investigation,” Aaron Weiss, deputy director at the Center for Western Priorities said in a statement. “Her lack of candor to ethics officials casts a shadow on anything that crosses her desk today, and on everything that she worked on during the first Trump administration. Because Budd-Falen’s portfolio is so large, the litigation risks posed by her position alone could paralyze the Interior department for years to come.”

Tax Increment Financing can leave towns holding the bag if growth falls short.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  John Bossange: Using TIFs to fund growth is a big risk.","This commentary is by John Bossange, the president of the board of directors of Better (not Bigger) Vermont.



For taxpayers in Vermont, the success of designating Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts to promote commercial and residential development must be understood as a program with inherent risks. 
In many cities and towns across America, TIF has been a tool used by municipalities to finance public infrastructure, including streets, sidewalks, public water, public sewage treatment and stormwater management systems in a specific area designated as a TIF district.

To fund it, voters authorize a municipal bond to finance the construction of infrastructure to support the building of homes and commercial property by private developers.  
The plan is that this public investment will attract new private investment, business and visitors, incrementally increasing the value of the grand list, and generate more revenue for the city to finance and then repay the infrastructure bonded debt.  
Towns can keep 70% of this property tax revenue to pay off the bond, while 30% must be sent to the Vermont Education Fund. On paper, this reads like good news.
But there is more to TIF funding than meets the eye.
After the developers have made their money, financial shortfalls such as declining revenue projections and property values, higher assessments, administrative errors, underperforming projects and the negative impact on the Education Fund can place a city’s finances in arrears. 
Over time, if a city, town or village is not vigilant, it may not be able to grow its way out of the bond debt when the anticipated revenue stream does not materialize. The only solution then to repay any lingering debt is to increase taxes or to rely on unpredictable impact fees.
Concerns have arisen in other cities, such as St. Albans and Killington, where the TIF program’s overall economic impact is now in question. Audits frequently show delays in cost recovery and overestimated economic benefits, leaving taxpayers footing the bill for developments that did not deliver their promised benefits.  
A recent study in Kansas showed several districts falling behind in their debt repayment, forcing the city to cover shortfalls with non-TIF funds and placing additional strain on the city’s budget. 
Managing TIF funding is a complicated process. Poor bookkeeping, accounting errors, misallocation of funds, miscalculating land values, and underpaying the state’s Education Fund—as happened in Burlington—have been common and costly mistakes made by too many municipalities, especially in smaller towns and villages that lack the required expertise and staff.  
The biggest concern is the negative impact of TIF financing on the Vermont Education Fund. The use of TIF means our property tax revenue, normally sent to the fund, will be diverted to repaying the TIF bond during the repayment period. The Joint Fiscal Office reports estimate this loss to be between $3 million and $7 million annually.  
This is a major concern for those who manage the financial health of this important fund and should be a cause for alarm in all Vermont towns and cities. 
Finally, in addition to the financial risk that arises when a municipality relies increasingly on growth and development, I believe towns could become caught in a vicious cycle, spinning faster and faster, growing into one large overdeveloped TIF district as they attempt to generate enough growth, ultimately leading to unsustainable sprawl.  
Maybe some welcome that vision for Vermont. I do not, and I would like residents across our state to understand all the inherent risks of using Tax Increment Financing.  
I believe the potential environmental impacts of sprawling TIF districts and the economic impacts on a town’s need for municipal services could disrupt the quality of life for everyone. That would be a disincentive to build, which is the last thing Vermont needs, given our acute housing shortage.
I also believe there could be a taxpayer revolt if towns using TIF to promote growth for commerce and housing do not keep their eye on the ball.  
Yes, we need more affordable housing of all types built in appropriate locations. But no town wants to be on that hamster wheel of debt repayment, trying to fund unsustainable economic growth and development, all the while creating a nightmare of congestion, the need for more resources, a loss of village, town or city character, and eventual environmental degradation.

The costs that American households pay for all purchases and expenses has increased by $1,625 nationally, according to an analysis released by Democrats on the congressional Joint Economic Committee (JEC)Tuesday. 
The report was based on an analysis of Consumer Price Index (CPI) data through December 2025. In Nevada, housing and transportation costs have increased on average by $185 and $250 respectively. 
The analysis is the same method that the Republicans on the JEC used under the Biden administration.
During a speech at the Detroit Economic Club last week, Trump falsely claimed that “inflation has stopped” and that “prices are down.” The morning of Trump’s speech, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the CPI increased 2.7% in December compared to December 2024.
 “The data is clear: Donald Trump’s reckless policies and tariffs have done nothing to lower costs for families in the last year,” Nevada Democratic U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen said in a statement Tuesday.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A leading North Dakota oil producer is pausing new drilling amid low oil prices, but state regulators emphasized Tuesday the company is not exiting the Bakken.
Continental Resources Founder Harold Hamm said in a recent interview it will be the first time in 30 years the company will not operate a drilling rig in the state. But the company, the No. 2 oil producer in North Dakota, will continue to operate existing wells and likely reevaluate the economics of drilling in a few months.
“Continental is not pulling up stakes and leaving the state,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said during Tuesday’s meeting of the North Dakota Industrial Commission. 
Continental Resources had been operating three drilling rigs in North Dakota, but one has ceased operations, said Nathan Anderson, director of the Department of Mineral Resources. The two other rigs are expected to go offline by early March, Anderson said. 
Hamm told Bloomberg News that oil and gas companies are reassessing their drilling activity in all oil fields, not just North Dakota’s Bakken, due to thin profit margins.
“There’s no need to drill it when margins are basically gone,” Hamm said in the article.
A public relations representative from Continental Resources did not return a phone call seeking comment Tuesday.
North Dakota oil production resilient even as prices have declined

The breakeven price for companies operating in North Dakota ranges from $50 per barrel to $65 per barrel in West Texas Intermediate prices, depending on the geographic location, Anderson said. The price of WTI oil was $60 per barrel as of Tuesday morning. 
Low oil prices are likely to continue unless the supply of crude oil on the international market drops significantly or if demand grows quickly. 
“It’s a world problem. It’s not just a North Dakota issue,” Anderson said. “We’re oversupplied by 2 (million) to 3 million barrels right now.”
There are 30 active drilling rigs in North Dakota, three fewer than a year ago at this time, Department of Mineral Resources data shows. By comparison, the state had 27 drilling rigs operating during a downturn in 2016 and 11 rigs operating amid the COVID-19 downturn in the summer of 2020.
“To be clear, this isn’t the first time an oil company has laid down rigs,” Armstrong said. “It’s happened a lot.”
Anderson said he has heard from two other companies that have indicated they plan to halt drilling in the Bakken. 
Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said a divide has been developing between privately-owned companies and public companies traded on the stock market.
“The private companies have taken similar actions, or are in the process of taking similar actions,” Ness said. “The public companies have maybe gone from three rigs back to two rigs, tapping the brakes a little bit.”
North Dakota produced an average of 1.1 million barrels of oil per day in October, the most recent figures available. Only Texas and New Mexico produce more. 
While companies will sometimes shut in production due to low prices, Ness said he has not heard of that happening at this time. 
“You’re still producing the wells that you have,” Ness said. “We’re still going to make 1.1 million barrels a day for a while, but it will decline the longer this goes on.”
Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, said if other operators stop drilling, that impacts state oil tax revenue as well as sales tax revenue. 
Many drilling and hydraulic fracturing crews are based in Williston, Bekkedahl said, which means downturns in activity have a significant impact on the local community.
“As they start to downsize their operations, we take significant reductions in population to the city of Williston,” he said.

What Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla saw there",Wendy Fry,,,,,https://calmatters.org/justice/2026/01/california-city-ice-detention-senators/,"California Democratic Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff visited the newest and largest ICE detention center in the state, a former prison in Kern County. CoreCivic operates this site.","In summary
California Democratic Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff visited the newest and largest ICE detention center in the state, a former prison in Kern County. CoreCivic operates this site.


This is a developing story that will be updated.
Democratic U.S. Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff today conducted an oversight visit at the state’s newest and largest immigrant detention center, located in California City, about 100 miles north of Los Angeles. 
In remarks to reporters, both highlighted what they described as inadequate medical care at the site. 
“The most frequent feedback we got was the inadequacy of the medical care they are receiving,” said Schiff. He described meeting a diabetic detainee who he said has not received treatment for her condition in two months. “That’s frightening,” he said.
More than 1,400 people are currently held at the California City Detention Facility, run by the private for-profit prison company CoreCivic in the middle of the Mojave Desert. It opened in late August under a contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with a capacity to hold 2,560 detainees.
Previously, CoreCivic operated the site as a state prison. The Newsom administration ended the contract in 2024 as it closed several state prisons because of California’s declining incarcerated population.
“They’re going to have to do something very different if they’re going to meet the medical needs of the people here, let alone adding another 1,000 people,” Padilla said.
Before entering the facility, Schiff and Padilla said they were conducting the inspection to “respond to complaints and questions from constituents about the conditions that detainees are in” and to “see firsthand what this facility is like.” 
“On this anniversary of the second Trump administration, one year in, there are a couple things we already know his term is defined by: the cruelty and over-aggressiveness of the mass deportation agenda,” said Padilla. 
“This is a necessary part of our oversight,” said Schiff. “We’ve all been working with constituents who have been detained here or are detained here and have described the falling conditions.” 
By law, members of Congress have a right to conduct unannounced inspections of immigration detention centers. But Padilla’s spokesman said the senators arranged the visit in advance. 
In July, House Democrats sued the administration over a policy requiring seven days advance notice for visits, which they argued violated federal law. In December 2025, federal Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., temporarily blocked the seven-day notice policy while the case plays out in court.
Following a deadly shooting incident involving an immigration officer in Minneapolis, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem issued a new memorandum on Jan. 8 re-imposing the seven-day notice requirement. On Jan. 19, Cobb did not immediately block this new, reinstated policy, concluding that the Jan. 8 directive was a “new agency action” that required a different legal challenge than the one previously decided. 
When President Donald Trump took office a year ago, roughly 40,000 people were being held in immigration detention across the nation. By the start of December, that number had risen by almost 75%, with nearly 66,000 people held in immigration detention across the United States and the system reportedly capable of holding 70,000 people on any given day — the highest level in U.S. history, according to government data.
Last month, the California Attorney General’s office warned of “dangerous conditions” at the California City facility. In a Dec. 19 letter to Noem, attorney Michael Newman wrote the California Department of Justice “has grave concerns about the conditions at the facility and the lack of adequate medical care,” after inspecting the facility.   
Attorney General Rob Bonta said the facility had “opened prematurely and was not prepared to handle the needs of the incoming population.”
Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, previously told Calmatters that the site has robust medical and mental health care on site, including around-the-clock access to those services. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”
“There are no delays in individuals getting their prescription medications,” Gustin said.
In November, detainees at the facility sued, alleging the facility is polluted by sewage leaks and insect infestations, and that detainees can’t get proper medical attention for life-threatening conditions.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/012026-Padilla-Schiff-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-20 19:56:54.748793

Senate District 26 GOP primary. (Image: NC Newsline)The most powerful Republican in the North Carolina Senate is trailing his 2026 primary opponent by 5 points in a poll released Tuesday, less than two months away from the March 3 contest.
Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) trails Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page in the poll by Republican-aligned firm National Research Inc., due to a crushing deficit in his home county, where Page leads him by 30 points. He remains ahead in more populous Guilford County, with 40% support against Page’s 29%.
The poll, which surveyed 250 Republican primary voters in the district from Jan. 15 to Jan. 18, was commissioned by longtime GOP political consultant Marc Rotterman. Neither Rotterman nor National Research Inc. are affiliated with the Berger or Page campaigns.
“This race is a jump ball with a slight edge to Sam Page’s campaign,” Rotterman said in a statement. “The question is, can Sam Page compete financially with Senator Berger’s massive war chest, or is this a race where the base has already made up their mind on the incumbent?”
The Berger campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the results.

Chris Cooper, a political scientist at Western Carolina University, said he remains skeptical that Page has the lead in the race. He noted that the National Research poll has a fairly limited sample size, and that its result is within the margin of error of 6.2%, meaning either candidate could be on top.
“If you apply that, you’d say this is a tied race,” he said. “It’s getting a clear and consistent signal that this is a very close race.”
Berger, who has led Senate Republicans for 21 years and the state Senate as a whole for 15, is deeply unpopular in Rockingham County, according to the poll. About 33% of residents surveyed have a favorable opinion of Berger, while 54% view him unfavorably, closely mirroring the margin in the race in Rockingham County
A key issue in the race, the National Research poll indicated, is casino gambling. Just 13% of those surveyed said they would be more likely to support a candidate who supports casino gambling in North Carolina, while 46% said they would be less likely to do so. In 2023, Berger led a high-profile push for a bill that would have brought casinos to a few rural North Carolina counties, including Rockingham.
That effort failed in part because it proved deeply unpopular among those counties’ residents — and the poll appears to indicate many voters have not forgotten Berger’s role. The National Research poll found that 43% of voters surveyed said Berger “represents special interests in Raleigh” against 24% who said Berger “represents us.”
By contrast, Page, who has been Rockingham County’s sheriff for 28 years, holds a high favorability rating in the views of surveyed voters. He was among the loudest voices opposing the casino proposal, calling it part of a “slippery slope” that would exacerbate social issues in the community.
“This is a very evangelical Christian district, and they’re just against gambling on principle,” Rotterman said in an interview. “For Page, he has an enormous amount of goodwill as you can see in his favorables, and I think that’s carried him so far.”

A key question remains how unaffiliated voters, which number more than 24,000 in the district, will behave. Unaffiliated voters are less likely than affiliated voters to cast a ballot in primary elections. But if significantly more unaffiliated voters than usual vote in the Republican primary — especially Democratic-leaning constituents in Guilford Co. who may seek to oust Berger — the results of the race could be difficult for any poll to predict, Cooper said.
“I think this is the most important state Senate primary, maybe in North Carolina history,” Cooper said. “If we see an interruption of those patterns, then it’s anybody’s guess what happens.”
The National Research survey  is the second recent poll to show Berger trailing in his primary, despite the endorsement of President Donald Trump and more than $2 million in ad buys by groups supporting his candidacy. A December poll by Opinion Diagnostics, affiliated with the Page campaign, showed the sheriff leading by 10 points in the race.
However, a January poll by Neighborhood Research and Media, led by Republican consultant and pollster Rick Shaftan, showed the reverse of the National Research poll, with Berger on top by 4 points among 325 Republican primary voters. That poll found only a 2o-point deficit for Berger in Rockingham and a larger lead in Guilford, where he led Page 46% to 18%.
In an exchange on social media site X with a pro-Berger account, Shaftan said negative ads against Page — which have slammed Page  over investigations by the State Bureau of Investigation — were the top reason voters gave for an unfavorable view of Berger.
“If the anti-Page barrage continues for another 7+ weeks, it will drive a total FU vote against Berger and this race won’t be close,” Shaftan said on social media. “Your consultants are ripping you off. I love negative ads more than anyone, but all your ads now should be positive. The negative stuff just isn’t working.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/berger-page.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota doctors say immigration crackdown is forcing patients to hide, endangering lives 
Diabetics rationing insulin. Jaundiced babies missing appointments. Appendicitis festering untreated for days. Expectant mothers laboring in hiding.
These were just some of the anecdotes shared by five Minnesota physicians Tuesday at a hastily scheduled Capitol press conference on the health care impacts of the federal law enforcement surge across the state. 
They were flanked by Democratic-Farmer-Labor Sens. Alice Mann and Matt Klein, both physicians. The group evoked a climate of fear keeping patients and their loved ones out of Minnesota clinics and hospitals.
“The only other time in history I can remember having a group of physicians standing in front of you (like this) was during COVID…this is a moment of crisis in our state,” Mann said to an audience of several dozen press, legislative staff and medical workers. 
The gathering came after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security recently subpoenaed Hennepin Healthcare for the I-9 forms it uses to confirm its workers’ identities and employment eligibility. Those forms include workers’ home addresses, Social Security numbers and other sensitive personal information.
Hennepin Healthcare operates Hennepin County Medical Center, a major safety net hospital in downtown Minneapolis that serves a relatively high proportion of uninsured and underinsured patients. Earlier this month, elected officials and HCMC staff called on hospital administrators to do more to protect patients after reports emerged that federal agents stood watch by a shackled detainee’s bedside and prevented family members from visiting him for more than a day over the New Year holiday.
Another detainee, Alberto Castaneda Mondragon, reportedly remains hospitalized at HCMC under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision after sustaining a “catastrophic” and “life-threatening” head injury in the hours after his Jan. 8 arrest, according to a lawsuit reviewed by Sahan Journal. It’s unclear exactly how the injury occurred, but the lawsuit alleges Castaneda Mondragon told hospital staff that he was roughed up by federal agents. 
In a statement about the New Year detention, HCMC said “any federal agents arriving with a patient presented appropriate identification, adhered to our established processes, and left after (hospital security) asked for documentation to support their continued presence.”
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to an email seeking comment.
The doctors assembled at the Capitol on Tuesday made clear that those assurances don’t go far enough.
Klein, a former Hennepin Healthcare physician running for U.S. Congress in Minnesota’s 2nd District, said he’d cared for “numerous patients” at HCMC in the midst of “formal interactions with the law…but I’ve never heard a concern over 35 years of practice that patients’ rights were violated.”
Klein tied what he said were federal agents’ disregard for patient privacy and well-being with the killing earlier this month of Renee Nicole Good, a U.S. citizen and mother of three. According to media and witness reports, agents rebuffed a physician who arrived at the scene shortly after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot Good at least three times. 
Klein said Good still had a pulse “eight minutes” after the shooting.
“I can’t say how much that stirs the blood of those behind me…and I believe it stirs the blood of every patriotic Minnesotan,” he said.
One by one, working physicians stepped up to the mic to describe the toll of a federal immigration and “anti-fraud” operation that has mushroomed into something more. Gov. Tim Walz last week described the roughly 3,000-agent force as an “occupation.”
Erin Stevens, chair of the legislative committee for the Minnesota chapter of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said ICE agents have waited in vehicles outside hospitals, routinely entered medical buildings and even followed patients into emergency rooms. 
Fewer patients are presenting at metro-area labor and delivery triage units amid a spike in requests for home births among patients who had previously intended to deliver in hospital and for whom home birth “is not a safe option,” Stevens added.
Janna Gewirtz O’Brien, a member of the executive board of the Minnesota chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said trauma stemming from “violence and the threat of family separation” could affect her young patients for many years to come. 
In the here and now, new mothers are laying low and deferring checkups for their babies as they weigh the benefits of health care against the risk of indefinite detention, Gewirtz O’Brien said. 
Families that feel safe enough to venture outdoors face health risks through no fault of their own, Gewirtz O’Brien added, noting the apparently incidental tear-gassing of a family vehicle in north Minneapolis during a chaotic ICE operation last week. A six-month-old riding in the vehicle was admitted to a nearby hospital with breathing problems.
“Chemical weapons have no place in our neighborhoods or schools. They can have life-threatening effects on children,” she said. “It’s only a matter of time before a child dies.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260119_0862-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

Brooke Green. D-Boise, listens to action on the House floor at the State Capitol building on Jan. 9, 2023. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)A state lawmaker proposed slight changes to an Idaho law approved last year that limited highway districts’ abilities to make bicycle or pedestrian improvements. 
Rep. Brooke Green, D-Boise, introduced a bill Tuesday that would specify that the limitations on those projects wouldn’t apply if the highway district received a federal or other grant specifically for standalone bike and pedestrian infrastructure. The bill would also narrow the criminal penalties for violating the law so they only apply to the elected officials, rather than “any person” who violated it. 
“The two proposed changes are few, not necessarily all the changes I’d love to see, but I think this is a good start,” Green told the House Transportation and Defense Committee on Tuesday. 
Last year, the Idaho Legislature approved Senate Bill 1140 and SB 1144, which narrows the definition of what constitutes the “for primary benefit of motor vehicles,” and prohibits highway districts from building standalone bike and pedestal projects except in specific locations, such as near parks or schools. It also prohibits highway districts from narrowing roads if they aren’t residential. 
The bills made it a misdemeanor crime to violate the law. 
Opponents of the bills argued they would hamper efforts to address bicycle and pedestrian safety after accidents or to slow traffic in cities, BoiseDev reported. 
The bill applies statewide, but largely impacts the Ada County Highway District, which covers the state’s most urban area in the Treasure Valley, BoiseDev reported. 
The committee unanimously voted to introduce the bill, which allows it to come return to the committee for a public hearing.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — After an attempt at a raise backfired last year, a panel of senators advanced a bill Tuesday that would give legislators back their longstanding $1,000 monthly expense allowances.
The 21-member Senate Finance Committee voted unanimously to advance the proposal. The bill includes backpay starting in July 2025, the first month legislators didn’t get their money, and would give them a lump sum of whatever amount legislators would have received by the time the governor signs it.
The state Supreme Court declared unconstitutional that portion of legislators’ paychecks, meant to cover expenses that come up outside the legislative session, as part of a decision striking down a budget clause that would have increased the amount from $1,000 to $2,500 monthly. Since legislators simply changed the amount in the budget, the 30-year-old monthly payments got caught in the crossfire, effectively cutting legislators’ pay by $12,000 per year.
The allowance stopped before the court’s November decision. In June, just before the financial year began, the court put the payments on pause pending a final decision, meaning legislators haven’t received their monthly pay for nearly six months.
Legislators continue to receive their annual salaries of $10,400 annually, and after the legislative session started again last week, they began receiving their $240 allowance intended to cover their costs for dining and staying in Columbia each day of session. They also get mileage for one round-trip weekly.
A raise is still possible, but the first step is restoring the pay legislators have come to expect since 1995, Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey told reporters ahead of the legislative session’s start.
Although many legislators have jobs that allow them to cover costs out of their own pockets, others, including retirees on fixed incomes, need to know how much they can expect to receive each year, the Edgefield Republican said. They may struggle to afford the extra expenses without the help, he added.
“Those folks, those who cannot have other employment, those people who are retired, they make plans based on what you’ve told them the income is going to be,” Massey said. “And when you tell them that they’re going to get $1,000 a month, they plan for that.”
One ex-legislator, who’s been in jail since last summer, is excluded from the back pay: former Rep. RJ May.
Senators put in an exception for any legislator who’s convicted of or who pleaded guilty to a felony during the pay pause. That only applies to the West Columbia Republican. The founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus pleaded guilty in September to sending videos of children being sexually abused. He was sentenced earlier this month to 17 years and six months in federal prison.
May resigned from the House in August, one month after the pause began. His resignation coincided with those of Sen. Roger Nutt, a Spartanburg Republican who resigned following an Alzheimer’s diagnosis, and Rep. Bobby Cox, a Greer Republican who initially planned to run for Nutt’s seat before later changing his mind and withdrawing. Rep. Chris Murphy, a Dorchester County Republican, turned in his resignation a week later, which took effect Jan. 5.
Those three would receive backpay until their effective resignation date. The legislators elected to replace them would get backpay starting after their swearing-in ceremonies.
No legislators have yet proposed a standalone bill that would put the pay raise back on the table. The idea is worth discussing, Massey said, but a pay increase would likely face an uphill battle this year, as members of the House campaign to keep their seats.
Yet, if legislators want a raise, this could be their only chance to get one for another three years.
The state Supreme Court decided pay raises can only take effect after an election, when a new General Assembly is chosen. If legislators miss the January 2027 window, they will have to wait until January 2029, following the 2028 elections, to get an increase.
Some opponents of the pay raise, including Massey, wouldn’t be against increasing the amount legislators receive. The bigger problem for Massey was the late-night addition of the raise to the state budget, which received little debate and no input from the public.
Senators made a point to reinstate their pay through a stand-alone bill voted on in a public hearing, not through the budget process as it was in the past.
“Whatever we do, my hope is that it’s going to be much more transparent and open than the process that we had before,” Massey said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_6059-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

Michelle Lujan Grisham delivered her final State of the State address on Jan. 20, 2026, and called on lawmakers to embrace bipartisanship in the 30-day legislative session. (Kate Russell for Source NM)In her final State of the State address, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham laid out an ambitious blueprint for lawmakers over the next month, with priorities ranging from her relatively new universal child care platform to longstanding public safety objectives.
She opened, however, with a video that showed her at a table in Tia Sophia’s with several of her predecessors: Republican Governors Gov. Susana Martinez, Gary Johnson and Garrey E. Carruthers (former Democratic Gov. Toney Anaya appears via phone call, as well).
The restaurant, she said, is where she’d meet the late Sen. John Arthur Smith, who died in 2024, to hash out budget items, and where many elected officials meet to talk about the future of New Mexico and its capital city.
The governor, who has not always gotten along with members of her own Democratic party, let alone Republicans, used her final speech to underscore a message of finding common ground, a theme she has spoken of more frequently in the past year, including at a public event in Utah last fall with Republican Gov. Spencer Cox.
“Let’s teach America, because I think they need to learn again, that bipartisanship is not something to give up or to leave behind,” she said during her address. “It’s the New Mexico model.”
Lujan Grisham also used the speech to make her pitch for universal child care, and to underscore her accomplishments over the last seven years.
“What we’ve built over the last seven years isn’t just a list of accomplishments,” she said. “It’s a blueprint. The story of the past seven years starts with the children who represent the future of our state.”
Paying for universal child care
Lujan Grisham first unveiled the state’s plan for universal child care last September. While questions have emerged since then about capacity, perhaps the greatest hurdle lies in the Legislature, where lawmakers appear reluctant to pay for the governor’s plan, which calls for a $160 million spending increase.
“I’m asking for a $160 million recurring increase for universal childcare to cement our legacy as a state of generational opportunity instead of a state with generational poverty,” she said in her address. 
However, when lawmakers in early January presented their budget proposal, they only called for increasing the Early Childhood Education and Care Department’s spending by $13.7 million. Legislative Finance Committee analysts at the time wrote that universal free childcare will “create additional demand for childcare assistance without the necessary revenues to implement this policy decision should more people apply and qualify for subsidies.”
In Tuesday’s speech, Lujan Grisham said 10,000 additional kids are enrolled in child care because of the changes the state has made, and highlighted one specific family: Kenny and Crystal Martinez, a firefighter paramedic and emergency room nurse, respectively. 
“They’ve had to rely on alternating overtime shifts to make ends meet,” the governor said, and had two children who didn’t qualify for assistance because their combined income was too high.   “That meant one parent staying home while the other one was at work. That meant, as I said, 12-hour shifts at work followed by long stretches caring for the baby alone. It was lonely, it was stressful — and it’s just too damn hard.”
The governor also gave a shout-out to the other side of the equation: the child care providers, spotlighting Angela Garcia, who runs a child care center in Las Cruces.
“With the enhanced rate in universal childcare, which you all did, she‘s given everyone on her staff a raise — helping great caregivers to keep doing what they love,” Lujan Grisham said. “And now, she’s expanding her childcare centers. She’s serving an additional 80 infants and toddlers to meet the new demand for care.”
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said during her State of the State address on Jan. 20, 2026, that she did not consider her final regular session “a victory lap.” (Kate Russell for Source New Mexico)
Education
Education in New Mexico is “not where it needs to be,” Lujan Grisham said in Tuesday’s address. However, she touted meaningful ground the state has gained in recent years.
In 2024, for example, nearly 80% of high school students across the state graduated on time, the highest such rate in 15 years, she said. She said she hopes to hit the national benchmark of 87% this year.
The governor also included funding and legislation to boost literacy and math rates as part of her agenda, as well as a cell phone ban.
“Our approach isn’t about troubleshooting around the edges,” she said. “It’s about rebuilding our education system from top to bottom so fewer kids fall behind, more stay engaged and more gain the skills they need.”
Last year, Lujan Grisham signed into law Senate Bill 11, which required local school districts and charter schools to adopt a wireless communication device policy. She called the policy a good “first step,” but also said she was “profoundly disappointed” lawmakers chose to amend the bill to make compliance optional for local districts. 
She also called on lawmakers to permanently establish the Office of Special Education, which she established within the Public Education Department in 2023 by executive order, “so families don’t have to fight the system.”
Economic development
The governor included $150 million in tax credits “to solidify New Mexico’s position as a national leader in investment for future-forward technologies like quantum and fusion energy.” 
Lujan Grisham last fall announced a $120 million dollar partnership with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, called the Quantum Frontier Initiative, saying she wanted New Mexico to be known as the “home of quantum computing.”
New Mexico Governor announces new federal quantum computing partnership

This year, the company Quantinuum opened a research and development facility in New Mexico. It joins other private sector and government quantum startup efforts in the state, including the state-funded Roadrunner Quantum Venture Studio and the federally funded Quantum Tech Hub. In September, Pacific Fusion, a California-based fusion energy company, announced plans to build a $1 billion research and manufacturing campus in Albuquerque.
The state Economic Development Department in early December released a 158-page report that calls for further growth in science and technology fields including quantum systems, advanced energy and aerospace.
“When these students graduate from college or earn their certificates from trade or technical schools, we’ve got the strongest economy in history waiting for them,” Lujan Grisham said Tuesday. “Over the last seven years, we’ve added 150,000 jobs, including in rural communities.”
A December Legislative Finance Committee report found that, unlike much of the nation, New Mexico’s economy is not in or near a recession, despite President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” having an outsized effect on New Mexico’s traditional revenue sources, including corporate income taxes.
She touted how the national firm Moody’s Ratings earlier in January upgraded New Mexico’s bond rating to one of the highest national rankings.
“The people who measure risk for a living see our state as one of the smartest bets in the country,” she said. “It means lower borrowing costs — so we can build roads, schools and housing while saving taxpayers money. It means more investor activity, bringing funding and jobs to our state. It means that after years of being underestimated, New Mexico hasn’t just arrived — ladies and gentlemen, we’re leading the way.”
Infrastructure
The recent economic growth means the state’s infrastructure needs upgrading, Lujan Grisham said. 
She also called for an interest-rate buydown program to make owning a home more attainable in New Mexico.
Lujan Grisham specified in her speech money for roads and housing, specifically:

a $1.5 billion transportation bonding package to fund major state-managed road projects and free up funds for local improvements. 
$110 million for new housing units and homelessness initiatives.
zoning reform to expedite and increase housing production.

Climate
Lujan Grisham painted New Mexico as a national leader in renewable energy. In 2019, she signed into law the Energy Transition Act, which set benchmarks for New Mexico utilities to transition to 100% renewable energy sources.
In December, the New Mexico Environment Department unveiled a Climate Action Plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The crowd gave Lujan Grisham the loudest applause of her remarks when she called on lawmakers to codify the plan into state law.
Legislation to codify the governor’s Climate Action Plan to cut pollution 45% by 2030 and meet net-zero emissions goals by 2050 will once again be heard at the Legislature. Last year, the Clear Horizons Act, sponsored by Senate President Pro Tem Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque), failed to advance beyond Senate Finance. This year’s legislation had not been introduced as of publication, but Stewart has described it as “shorter and leaner.”
Lujan Grisham also said she wants to see a commission to “leverage and utilize private and public investments, grow our economy and protect consumers and businesses, while meeting exploding energy demands with more clean power.”
Public Safety
Public safety has emerged as an area of frustration for the governor over her two terms. She called a special session in 2024 to focus on public safety, but her agenda was thwarted by Democratic lawmakers. She then embarked on a statewide tour to gin up support for her public safety agenda. Last year, she excoriated lawmakers at the end of the session for not adequately addressing juvenile crime in the aftermath of a March 21 mass shooting in Las Cruces.

Since then, legislative Republicans also have held town halls focused on public safety, including juvenile justice. Republican lawmakers on Tuesday cast themselves as “unlikely allies” with Lujan Grisham on public safety matters. During their own public safety town halls across New Mexico, several elected Republicans made reference to that unlikely alliance in their requests to include public safety matters on this year’s legislative agenda. Democrats, likewise, announced plans to tighten regulations on firearm dealers.
Lujan Grisham on Tuesday referenced her own frustration over the lack of progress with her public safety priorities. In the last seven years, she said she has pushed for more engagement on public safety and “more backbone.”
Colfax County residents weigh in on crime

“If anyone tells you we’ve done enough to rein in violent crime, ask them if they would say that to a family made smaller by violence,” she said. “Would they say it to the parents trying to protect their kids? Would they say it to the children who have lost someone they love because we refused to keep dangerous criminals behind bars? I don’t think they would.”
During her State of the State, Lujan Grisham specified legislation geared at:

juvenile justice reform to address severe teen crimes. 
assault weapons ban and gun dealer accountability to fight gun violence
strengthening penalties on felons in possession of firearms. 
stricter pre-trial detention measures for suspects charged with violent crimes.

Senate Republicans, in a news conference immediately following the governor’s speech, said they felt vindicated by the governor’s emphasis on public safety, though Sen. Bill Sharer (R-Farmington), the minority floor leader, sharply criticized her proposals for an assault weapons ban and more accountability for sellers. 
He also credited the state oil and gas industry for the accomplishments the governor touted in her speech.
“The governor took credit for a lot of stuff today, and granted, a lot of stuff happened, some of it even good,” Sharer said. “But it was because we had a thriving oil and gas industry.”

Health care
Health care also has emerged as an area of overlap between the governor and legislative Republicans.
“We’re seeing this fight play out at the national level — arguments over who deserves care, and what kind of care you deserve,” she said Tuesday. “Here’s my take: Healthcare shouldn’t depend on who you are, where you live, or how much money you make. It’s not a luxury. It should be a fundamental right  in America.”
Lujan Grisham backs legislation that will address:

medical malpractice reform to lower the cost of care and keep health care professionals in New Mexico. 
health care licensing compacts to ease staffing shortages, build a workforce pipeline and improve access for patients. 
eliminating the gross receipts tax on medical services to keep care affordable.
building the University of New Mexico’s medical school to double enrollment and educate the next generation of health care workers. 

In closing her speech, the governor returned to the theme of bipartisan agreement, asking lawmakers to “talk to each other” and spend time together at a list of local restaurants within walking distance of the Roundhouse, including Tia Sophia’s, Tomasita’s, The Pantry, The Shed, La Choza, Market Steer, Palace Prime, Pink Adobe and Plaza Cafe. “Communicate. Listen. Disagree. And keep trying.”
She also specified she did not consider her final regular session “a victory lap.”
“We’re not slowing down. We’re just going to push forward,” she said. “Let’s double down and do it all.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Govfeaturekaterussell-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

Rent stabilization? Rent control? 
Whatever name you choose for the Providence City Council’s much-anticipated measure to regulate apartment prices, the ordinance has finally entered into public view, two days ahead of its formal introduction at Thursday’s upcoming council meeting.
The ordinance, should it survive the council’s policymaking process intact, promises a 4% annual cap on rent increases, plus a bevy of exemptions meant to soothe property owners’ concerns about the potentially deleterious effects the measure could have on their business. 
Last January, the Providence metro area’s notably pricey housing market was rated by RedFin as the least affordable in the nation, a dubious distinction which City Council President and ordinance primary sponsor Rachel Miller embraced at a Tuesday afternoon press event in Providence’s Elmwood neighborhood. The city has seen rents increase by 40% since 2020, she said.
“Has our income increased by 40% in the last five years?” Miller asked the crowd, which roared a collective no.
With the city’s rent increases averaging about 16% in recent years, Miller said, “It means that far too often, a rent increase — even within 60 days’ notice mandated by state law — is an eviction notice by another name. It has to stop.”
Miller was joined Tuesday by several of her fellow City Councilors and ordinance cosponsors, plus a few dozen advocates, tenants and even a landlord, to extoll the proposal’s specific design, with many of the features installed to prevent the mistakes and unintended consequences made in other cities with similar policies. 
Miller argued that rent stabilization “does not decrease housing production,” and offered Portland, Maine, as an example, where she said the construction of new homes has not ceased or even slowed since the city introduced “the strongest rent stabilization in the country at the time in 2020.” 
“No shade on Portland,” Miller said. “Our housing market is hotter than Portland, Maine.”
To appease landlords, the proposed ordinance would exempt newly built apartments for 15 years. Smaller landlords who live in their properties — provided they have three or fewer units — would also be exempt; these owners would have the option to exempt a second property. 
Gabe Long, a Providence resident, is one of these small landlords. He told the crowd he owns and lives in a building where he rents out the other unit, and he owns a second property as well. 
Long said he was concerned when the house next door to him went up for sale. He wondered if some anonymous real estate giant from Boston or New York would come in and “squeeze every single possible dollar out of it.”
Instead, a local couple purchased the building, Long said. They don’t live there, but they rake the leaves and salt the sidewalk when snow falls.
“It’s their one investment property, and they care about it, and same as me, they want long-term tenants because they want stable income,” Long said. “They don’t want to jack up the rent every chance they get in order to give a theoretically improved return on investment presentation to a room full of shareholders.” 
Once introduced on Thursday, the measure will go to the council’s Committee on Health, Opportunity, Prosperity, and Education. The council’s double-pass process means the ordinance will have to pass committee and full-council votes more than once, giving plenty of opportunities for substantial revisions to emerge.
The process has only just begun, Miller acknowledged.
“In the coming weeks — and really it’s already been going on for months — a narrative of fear will be unleashed on our city,” Miller said. “We will hear a long list of ‘the sky is falling’ worst case scenarios. But the reality is this ordinance will make Providence stronger, not weaker.”

Opponents: ‘Be very wary of the narrative’
Depending on whom you ask, the ordinance is a long-awaited measure of relief or certain chaos for the capital city’s housing market.
In his turn at the podium Tuesday, Eric Hirsch, a professor of sociology at Providence College, said that Providence is a city full of “middle-class housing that has gotten old.” With little profit incentive to make affordable housing — a business model whose origin he located in the Ronald Reagan era — Hirsch argued that the city’s many multifamily homes were built for a now defunct version of the middle class. 
Now these buildings are populated by those who make less, but can’t find affordable housing either. Hirsch went so far as to say the council was being too kind with its exemptions.
“Given all the exemptions that were put in — I might not have put all those in — but given those exemptions, they aren’t going to have any problem in terms of doing what they need to do if they’re going to maintain their building,” Hirsch said.
The council’s ordinance makes several concessions meant to help property owners make changes to their buildings without relying on squeezing tenants. If an owner’s property taxes increase more than 5% in a single year, they can recoup up to 50% of the increase above 5% by raising the price of a rent-stabilized unit, although a unit’s price could not be raised more than a 10% in a year without board approval.  
A new Residential Rent Regulation Board would also handle tenant complaints and accept petitions from landlords who want an above-cap increase for significant capital improvements. The board would consist of five volunteers and an executive director. 
Shannon Elizabeth Weinstein, director of the Rhode Island Coalition of Housing Providers and an associate broker with RentProv Realty, disagrees. While she was still reviewing the ordinance’s fine print Tuesday, Weinstein said that “regardless of how they structured the tax pass through,” the council’s proposal will wreak downstream havoc on the housing market, especially on single-family homeowners. She argued they’ll be forced to compensate for the revenue lost from multifamily homeowners, no matter what “Rubik’s cube of exemptions” the council decided upon.
“I would say to just be very wary of the narrative that they’ve crafted something special,” Weinstein said. “There’s nothing special or unique about it. This has happened time and time again with every single rent control policy that’s out there.”
In something of a preemptive strike on the ordinance before it was even made public, the Providence Foundation commissioned the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council (RIPEC) to look into the issue and determine: Does it work?
“This really hasn’t worked anywhere,” said RIPEC’s Jeffrey Hamill, who was the primary author and researcher for the report released on Jan. 8. “The idea that somehow we’re going to find the right policy mix to make this work, I’m skeptical.”
RIPEC maintained editorial control over the document, Hamill said, and he added that he consulted with proponents in his broad overview of the existing research on rent control. He noted that “the value of a rental building is inextricably tied to the income it can bring in.” 
“If you limit that income through rent control, you necessarily make that building worth less money,” Hamill said, noting that
Providence’s ordinance was not available when Hamill authored the report, but St. Paul, Minnesota, gave enough evidence against the general idea. In St. Paul, building permits dropped once rent control was introduced in 2021, leading nearby Minneapolis to pick up a share of its business. The St. Paul law capped increases at 3% and did not include an exemption for new construction, which led to “an aggregate loss of $1.6 billion in the city’s taxable base,” according to the report.
Rent control policies can further exert a paradoxical effect in that the price control mechanism is attached to a specific unit, and is “not based on the renter’s ability to pay,” Hamill said. That means “the largest subsidies go to people who are renting the highest cost units.”
The report contends that rent control never lowers rents; it only caps them. That can incentivize landlords to raise rent to the maximum legal limit every year, the report suggests.

Hamill offered that “the best way to lower rents in the city of Providence” would be to build more units, encourage market competition and, “while we wait for those units to come online, to give people a subsidy.”
Councilor Sue AnderBois — a candidate for lieutenant governor and ordinance cosponsor — said in a Tuesday morning phone call that the council wants to create predictability for the city’s tenants going forward.
AnderBois said she has seen the RIPEC report, “and a lot of other reports” — all evidence of what not to do when drafting policy, she said.
“We really tried to learn from what worked well, what hasn’t worked well,” AnderBois said. “The goal is to actually help solve this problem, to actually stabilize the rent. It’s not to just do this policy so we can say we did it.”
The ordinance would not be a panacea, AnderBois said, for the city’s housing crisis, and rent stabilization would only be one kind of medicine — one, perhaps, for peace of mind. 
“For many residents, this is 30% or more of their usual budget,” AnderBois said of rent prices. “That is huge. So for them to not know year to year, what the change to that very enormous piece of their budget could be, is incredibly stressful and could cause people to leave the city. It has caused people to leave the city. So we want to give them that predictability, that ability to stay here in the city.”
Contrasting points of view in the mayoral race
State Rep. David Morales — a Providence Democrat challenging Providence Mayor Brett Smiley for control of Providence in this September’s Democratic primary— attended Tuesday’s press event and stood with supporters beneath trees shaking snow from their boughs.
Speaking to reporters afterward, he called the current version of the ordinance an effort at “making sure that our neighbors are able to stay safely housed.”
Morales said he “firmly” supports rent stabilization, and that his administration “would fully enforce the ordinance by collaborating with the council.”
At a separate and unrelated press conference of his own Tuesday, Smiley reaffirmed to reporters what he called his “deep skepticism” about the proposal.
“I suppose it’s possible that there is some version in the world that might help with tenants at risk of displacement, without all of the other bad effects that come from it,” Smiley said. “But the reality is that this will lower no one’s rent.”
Like RIPEC, Smiley identified the rental pricing scheme as a pure price cap rather than a deflationary lever, and offered that landlords could very well raise the rent to its maximum allotted each year. 
The mayor promised to veto the ordinance if it passes “as written.”
Back in Elmwood, when asked by reporters what the council would do if Smiley vetoed the ordinance should it pass, Miller began by calling it “a very strong proposal” crafted with meticulous attention.
“I haven’t yet talked to the mayor about this particular proposal,” Miller said. “I’m looking forward to that conversation, and I’m forever optimistic and open to a positive discussion.” 
She then promised a tête-à-tête if necessary, and suggested the Council may work to veto Smiley’s veto.
Said Miller: “If we have to, we’ll move forward on a veto as well.”

Knight briefly changed his party affiliation to Democrat before reversing it. (Photo: Knight Facebook page)The North Carolina State Board of Elections voted 3-2 Tuesday to overrule the Wilson County Board of Elections in favor of a Republican candidate seeking to run for sheriff.
Bobby Knight, a senior deputy in the Nash County Sheriff’s Office, maintained he has been a registered Republican since 2012. But in December, when he says he tried to update his address through the state Division of Motor Vehicles website, he claims he accidentally changed his party affiliation.
State law prohibits a person from filing as a candidate in a party primary unless that person has been affiliated with that party for at least 90 days.
Wilson County sheriff candidates Brandon Barbrey, a Democrat, and Kevin Raper, a Republican, each filed candidate challenges arguing that the change made Knight ineligible to run for the office as either a Democrat or Republican.
But Knight maintained he never really intended to run as a Democrat. He called the switch ‘a technological mistake.’ Knight said he changed his affiliation back to being Republican within a matter of hours of making the initial update in the online portal.
After a three-hour hearing, the Wilson Co. Board of Elections voted 4-1 in early January that Knight was not qualified to be a candidate in the race.
On Tuesday, Knight’s attorney Rhyan Breen told the state board that procedural errors in that local hearing deserved another look, and that his client should not be disqualified in seeking elected office.
“Probably one of the more egregious violations is that during the deliberation, the panel allowed one of its own panel members to testify, and this is important because it didn’t happen during the presentation,” offered Breen.

State board member Jeff Carmon questioned how Knight could have got through the entire process of updating his address online while overlooking the guardrails put in place to make sure the information he was entering was correct.
“How are you getting over all of these safety steps to say it was a mistake?” asked Carmon.
“He very eloquently calls it a ‘fat finger’,” said Breen in describing Knight’s rush to get to work that day. “Essentially, what he did was just click through the remainder of the boxes as soon as possible until he got to the end.”
“So, for the first time when he clicked it by mistake, fat finger, he meant to hit ‘Republican’ and he hit ‘Democrat’,” Carmon responded. “But then when it listed it all out for him to read and confirm? That’s not a fat finger. He either meant to do it, or are you saying he didn’t read it?”
“He didn’t read it,” said Knight’s attorney.
But attorney Andrew Simpson, representing Barbrey, said Knight knew what he was doing.
In its ruling disqualifying Knight, the Wilson Co. Board of Elections seemed to call the timing of the change into question.
State board member Stacy “Four” Eggers IV reasoned that Knight should be allowed to correct the mistake and take part in the race. (Photo: ncsbe.gov)
According to the January 8 ruling, the evening before Knight changed his party affiliation , incumbent Wilson County Sheriff Calvin L. Woodard, a Democrat, sent an email to his staff informing them he would not be running for reelection.
The next morning, Knight logged onto the DMV website to purportedly update his address. At that time, Knight changed his party affiliation from Republican to Democrat.
A few hours later, after learning from Barbrey that Barbrey would also be running for the office as a Democrat, Knight logged back onto the DMV website and changed his party affiliation back to Republican. Woodard has endorsed Barbrey to succeed him.
State board member Stacy “Four” Eggers IV said he viewed Knight’s change as an error that the candidate should be entitled to correct, just as any voter would be allowed to cure a mistake on the ballot.
Board member Bob Rucho agreed with Eggers that Knight should not be disqualified.
“What we’re going to be doing is preventing voters from having a chance to choose candidates of their own,” said Rucho. “And if I make an error, it’s always going to be on the side of giving the voter an opportunity to choose the people that they would like to pick.”

Siobhan O’Duffy Millen, one of two Democrats on the state board, urged her colleagues not to overrule the local board of elections, which voted against Knight.
“We’re opening ourselves up in the future to a lot of shenanigans,” said Millen. “I think that’s just a Pandora’s box that we shouldn’t get into.”
Board chair Francis De Luca sided with his Republican colleagues in rejecting the Wilson County Board of Elections’ decision to disqualify Knight from this year’s election.
De Luca said the board will discuss in the future whether the DMV website was meant to be more than a vehicle registration portal.
“I don’t think it was meant to handle more than that, but it’s doing a lot more than that now,” De Luca said.
Knight praised the decision late Tuesday.
“Due process prevailed, and the decision now returns where it belongs … the people of Wilson county will finally get to decide who they want to be Sheriff.” said Knight in a statement on social media.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/knight-1024x664.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

He is shown speaking during the 2024 legislative session to the House Budget Committee (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).Missouri’s budget picture brightened slightly this week with the discovery of a $250 million error in state projections, though lawmakers were warned Tuesday the change isn’t enough to take tight controls off state spending.
State Budget Director Dan Haug told the House Budget Committee that more than $100 million in disaster relief appropriations were mistakenly counted in next year’s spending and in the current year.
As a result, instead of the $4.7 million ending balance in the coming fiscal year, Missouri’s general revenue fund will hold $261 million. That new projection, if accurate, would still be the lowest general revenue balance to end a fiscal year since 2018.
“While that does make our bottom line better, it does not change the fundamental issue that our ongoing expenditures are more than our ongoing revenues,” Haug said. “It doesn’t change either of those two numbers.”
The state treasury held $4.3 billion of general revenue on June 30, the final day of fiscal 2025. That is down from a historic high of $5.7 billion at the end of fiscal 2023 as lawmakers have spent more than taxes for general revenue have generated over the past two years.
The current budget continues that trend. With supplemental items requested by Gov. Mike Kehoe, the state will budget $16.2 billion of general revenue in the current year, about $3.1 billion more than is expected in revenue. 
As a result, $2 billion will remain on June 30, the governor’s budget projects.
Kehoe’s budget for the next fiscal year, delivered to lawmakers Jan. 13, anticipates general revenue appropriations to total $16.3 billion, with revenues expected to be $13.6 billion.
The extra money revealed by correcting the calculation error will make it easier for the state to keep up with current bills in future years but isn’t enough to add any spending beyond Kehoe’s budget proposal, said House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel.
“It didn’t change anything, because really, $4 million wasn’t a good place to be,” Deaton said.
The variables in the forecast, which will determine the actual fund balance, are how fast the state will complete $1.3 billion of multi-year construction projects and how close the state is on estimating operating budgets.
More than $900 million set aside for state operations in fiscal 2025 was unspent, but the budget anticipates that figure will be only $350 million in the coming fiscal year and uses that money to balance spending and revenues.
The updated forecast can be debated but it is not far off, Deaton said.
“I could come up with one a little different, and reasonable people could probably argue about it,” Deaton said. “I can’t point to anything and say this is ridiculous.”
The updated forecast gives Democrats ammunition to push for their spending priorities, said state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
There should be more money available, Fogle said. She noted that the state Board of Education requested a $190 million boost to the foundation formula, the state’s main source of public school funding, that Kehoe did not recommend.
“What that changes is the governor signaled that he was comfortable spending down to $4.7 million, and I find it somewhat ironic that now he’s saying he needs to keep this additional $260 million on the bottom line as well, when there are things that I would argue we could be doing,” she said.
Republicans who hold all the state offices and a legislative supermajority have said for years the state should sock away money for lean times, Fogle said. But now that a budget crunch is here, she said, there’s no money to defer cuts.
Kehoe’s budget anticipates he will have to limit spending on almost $300 million in spending included his budget to produce the $261 million fund balance. The message from Kehoe and Haug is that there is no room for increases, Fogle said.
“It has been made clear by both the State of the State (address) and director Haug’s comments today,” Fogle said, “that there’s absolutely no appetite to add any spending from the governor’s original recommendations.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Haug-Budget-20240129-1-1024x674.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)On a party-line vote, a bill changing Wisconsin’s unemployment insurance laws, which Gov. Tony Evers’ office said he will veto, passed the Assembly  Tuesday.
The bill would allow people collecting federal disability payments to remain eligible for unemployment insurance if they lose a job. But it would cut their jobless pay by half the value of their disability pay.
The bill was sent to the Legislature from the joint labor-management Unemployment Insurance Advisory Council, which negotiates on a proposed “agreed-upon bill” every two years.
Historically the council’s bills have enjoyed broad support and easy passage, but the current measure, AB 652, includes changes that prompted opposition from Democrats. Evers’ spokesperson told the Wisconsin Examiner on Jan. 7 that the governor will veto the bill if it reaches his desk.
The bill is the first jobless pay measure in more than a decade to raise the maximum benefit, increasing it by $25 a week to $395. Critics argue that is inadequate.
The critics also object to reducing jobless pay for people who receive Social Security Disability Income, and to the measure’s proposed new strictures on the unemployment insurance system that Evers has previously vetoed.
A federal judge in July 2025 ordered the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development to stop enforcing a ban on unemployment compensation for SSDI recipients that was enacted in 2013. The judge ruled a year earlier that the ban violated federal laws protecting people with disabilities.
Before voting on the advisory council’s unemployment insurance bill Tuesday, Assembly Republicans voted 53-44 to block Democrats from passing a substitute amendment removing provisions they opposed and increasing the value of jobless pay. They went on to pass the unamended bill by the same 53-44 margin.
The Democratic amendment would have repealed the state’s ban on unemployment compensation for SSDI recipients, but without the financial penalty. The amendment also included a $127 increase in the maximum benefit through Jan. 2, 2027, followed by annual increases in line with the consumer price index. In addition, it increased the cap on how much income a laid-off person could make in a week while continuing to qualify for jobless pay.
“Wisconsinites deserve adequate unemployment benefits. This amendment is a step towards being able to do just that,” said Rep. Maureen McCarville (D-DeForest).
At a state Senate hearing Jan. 7, Scott Manley, a lobbyist for Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce and chair of the advisory council’s management caucus, defended the council bill’s jobless pay penalty for SSDI recipients, arguing that it would treat disability pay like other sources of income people get while they collect unemployment insurance.
“If you have additional income … that income is going to offset your unemployment benefits,” Manley said. “Unemployment is supposed to provide a temporary safety net of additional income for people who lose their job through no fault of their own.”
On the Assembly floor Tuesday, Rep. Chris Sinicki (D-Milwaukee) — who in the past has supported advisory council bills but came out against the council’s legislation in this session — reiterated her opposition. She said a constituent on the autism spectrum qualifies for SSDI and works part-time at a local library, allowing her to live independently.
“Without that part-time job, she could not afford to be independent,” Sinicki said. “I sure as heck do not want to be one to vote to take away benefits from the people who need them the most.”

Christian McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, asks a question during the July meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Local Government, July 29, 2025. (LRC Public Information)The Kentucky Senate once again approved a GOP-backed constitutional amendment that would limit pardon powers of Kentucky governors around election time.
If it makes it through the General Assembly, Senate Bill 10 would ask Kentucky voters in November to block governors from issuing pardons and sentence commutations 60 days before their election through their successor’s inauguration in December.
The Kentucky Senate voted 36-0 in favor of the measure Tuesday afternoon. One lawmaker, Senate Minority Caucus Chair Reggie Thomas, D-Lexington, passed on the vote.
Sen. Chris McDaniel, R-Ryland Heights, has filed the legislation several times before and it has cleared the Senate, but it has never gained passage in the House. The Senate State and Local Government Committee approved SB 10 last week. 
The bill is a response by lawmakers to controversial pardons former Republican Gov. Matt Bevin issued after losing the 2019 election to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. Bevin pardoned people convicted of crimes including rape, murder and child abuse. 
McDaniel said the bill would ask “the voters of the commonwealth if in the exercise of an unchecked override of justice, the person who exerts that power is responsible to then stand in front of the voters again, or force his party to stand in front of the voters again,” McDaniel said while presenting the bill. 
Republican House Speaker David Osborne previously told reporters that McDaniel had “worked really hard in the interim” to get House members to back the bill this year. 
“This reform has passed the Senate in multiple sessions, and I’m optimistic this is the year it reaches the ballot,” McDaniel said in a statement following the Senate’s approval. “I appreciate the encouraging words I’ve heard from House colleagues and the positive comments from Speaker Osborne.

Senators are considering how to write a law that could bar federal officers from hiding their identities in Vermont. But they’ll need to make it bulletproof against legal challenges.

Senators in the Judiciary Committee are trying to thread a needle, hashing out a bill that could stop law enforcement officers — including federal agents operating in Vermont — from masking while also weathering a potential lawsuit from the feds. 
They’re considering how to do things differently than California, which was sued by the federal government after it passed a law that specifically banned federal law enforcement officers from covering their faces. 
Vermont’s version, S. 208, could prevent all law enforcement officers from wearing a mask or disguise for the purpose of concealing their identity, rather than solely banning federal agents from doing so. 
That difference is an important legal distinction, according to Jessica Bulman-Pozen, a professor of constitutional law at Columbia Law School.
A clause in the U.S. Constitution prevents states from discriminating against the federal government or attempting to regulate it directly, Bulman-Pozen told the committee last week. That clause gives the federal government a case against the California law, she explained. 
But Vermont’s version would be stronger if it were challenged in court, Bulman-Pozen said, because it treats all law enforcement officers equally. 
And she thinks Vermont’s bill could be enforced against federal agents, she said. In past rulings, courts have upheld state laws that incidentally affect how federal officers carry out their work, Bulman-Pozen said. Those rulings give Vermont’s bill something to stand on, she said. 
On Tuesday, committee members continued to debate if the proposed crime should be a civil or criminal offense.
If it became a civil penalty for officers to conceal their identities, it could create a tricky situation for local law enforcement, said Jennifer Morrison, the commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Safety. State or local police officers would be tasked with citing federal officers for violating the law. 
The bill could task local or state police officers with citing their peers for the violation, she said. And it would be up to the officer whether to give someone like an ICE agent a warning rather than a citation. 
The state could also adopt rules about officer conduct without passing a new law, Morrison said, though those rules alone couldn’t be enforced against federal immigration agents. 
If the law doesn’t apply to federal officers, it’s really just a “feel good” statute, Morrison said. 
Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, P/D-Chittenden Central, said Tuesday that she wants the bill to go into effect immediately upon passage, rather than a delayed launch: “The terror that’s happening can’t wait until July to be solved.” 

In the know
Gov. Phil Scott proposed a $9.4 billion budget to state lawmakers on Tuesday that he called a “disciplined” spending plan in the face of waning support — and more cuts likely to come — from the federal government. 
Scott’s proposal, which lays out spending for the fiscal year starting in July, is about 3% larger than the budget he and the Legislature enacted last year. But he said his latest plan calls for fewer new initiatives, largely because the state no longer has Covid-19 pandemic-era federal relief funding available for new uses.
He also pointed to how the state’s top economists lowered previous estimates, in a report last week, for the amount of revenue the state will bring in through June. That decrease, which is only about $8 million, nevertheless indicates that legislators need to be frugal, Scott told the joint address of the House and Senate.
“It’s more important than ever to focus on the issues we can control, stay disciplined and set clear priorities so we make sure Vermonters get the most out of the resources we do have,” Scott said.

On the move
The House Human Services Committee moved its immunization bill out of committee today, along a 10-1 vote, with Rep. Todd Nielsen, R-Brandon, casting the lone dissent. 
The bill, H.545, broadens the state’s power to purchase vaccines from sources beyond the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and issue state-level immunization recommendations. Earlier this session, Health Commissioner Rick Hildebrant and others in his department testified to the committee in support of the bill.  
“I just want to be clear, this does not impose any mandates. Vaccines are still at the discretion of the individual,” said. Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, who chairs the committee. Several members noted having received concerns from constituents about whether the bill would require immunization. 
If the bill moves along the expected path, Wood said it should go to the floor for second reading this Thursday and final reading by Friday.

No. 1 fan
The award for Most Raucous Applause at Gov. Scott’s budget address goes to Communications Director Dustin Degree. Communication received. 
It seems Degree’s enthusiasm for supporting his boss has earned him a bit of a reputation. Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, who emceed the joint assembly for Scott’s budget address, issued this warning as he opened the proceedings:
“Before we begin, I want to remind you that the Senate rules apply to joint assemblies. So, although applause is permitted, in joint assemblies, whistling, hooting and yelling are not appropriate,” the LG said, before turning his gaze up toward the House gallery.

Lamont relents to pressure from CT farmers to stave off tax hike,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/ned-lamont-relents-to-pressure-from-farmers-to-stave-off-tax-hike/,The decision will keep in place recommended land values last adjusted in 2020. The governor also convened a working group to propose reforms.,"Gov. Ned Lamont ordered his administration to hold off on issuing new valuations for agricultural land Monday, bowing to pressure from farmers who argued that the changes would lead to huge tax hikes and force some families to sell their land. 
Lamont said that the canceled assessments — which in some cases would have caused the taxable value of farmland to double — were the result of an “unforeseen lack of data” the state had attempted to collect in an effort to determine the going rate for Connecticut’s dwindling amount of available farmland.
The decision will keep in place, for now, recommended land values that were last adjusted in 2020.
In addition to halting the proposed reassessments, the governor also convened a working group of farmers, municipal leaders, assessors and officials with the state’s Department of Agriculture to propose reforms to the process by which the state collects data and assesses the value of farmland, in an effort to avoid large price spikes in the future.
“Family farms are vital to Connecticut’s economy and are an essential part of our heritage,” Lamont said in a statement announcing his decision Monday. 
“Our work to address concerns around rising land use values demonstrates our understanding of the challenges farmers face,” he continued. “Preserving these lands is about more than economics, it’s about sustaining a way of life that defines Connecticut, and we look forward to continuing our partnership with the farming community to keep Connecticut agriculture strong.”
Lamont’s announcement met with an immediate sense of relief among farmers, dozens of whom gathered in Hartford’s Legislative Office Building on Tuesday for a forum on the issue hosted by Senate Republicans. While the event was announced prior to the shift in policy, lawmakers went ahead with a round table discussion to hear from farmers about their concerns over taxes and other economic issues.
“That is a huge step forward, and it takes a lot of the the anxiety out of the room, I’m sure, for the short term,” said Paul Larson, the president of the Connecticut Farm Bureau.
“But that’s just it,” Larson added. “It’s for the short term.”

Efforts to draw attention to the proposed assessment levels and their likely impact on taxes had ratcheted up in recent weeks ahead of the Jan. 31 deadline for municipal assessors to finalize their grand lists. An online petition calling on the state to stop the new assessments on farms from taking effect had gathered more than 20,000 signatures as of Monday, according to organizers.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, praised the decision not to move forward with the new assessments, which he said would have driven many smaller family farms out of business. 
“I think the governor realized that in an election year, that he couldn’t have that,” Harding said. “I think it was the result of farmers putting pressure on their government to do the right thing.” 
The controversy was the result of recent assessments undertaken as part of a decades-old state law known as Public Act 490, which was intended to help preserve farmland and open spaces by taxing the value of the land under its agricultural use — rather than its fair market value for development.
The law requires state officials to create a list of recommended land values that’s updated every five years, which local assessors can use to determine property taxes. The values are set by the state Office of Policy and Management, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture. As part of a regular revaluation period last year, the agencies partnered with the University of Connecticut to conduct a survey of farmers who either leased or rented out their land.
The survey was plagued by low response rates and incomplete data from farms used in prior surveys, according to findings from the survey’s researchers. When the updated assessments were released in October, some farmers were shocked to see the value of their land had increased dramatically.
For example, the taxable value of an acre of Tillable A farmland — which includes the most productive soils for growing crops — increased from $1,880 to $3,250, an increase of 72%. (Some of the values were even higher in the Connecticut River Valley region, where farmland is generally more expensive.)
Kim Grijalva, who operates a 100-acre cattle farm with her family in North Stonington, said the value of the pastures on which she grazes her herd of 38 Texas Longhorn cattle had grown four-fold under the state’s initial assessments. Even worse, she said, was the sudden spike in value for bits of land composed of rocky outcroppings and creek — known as “ledge” and previously valued at just $40 an acre — to $970 an acre.
After Grijalva and other farmers protested the initial increases, OPM announced a series of revisions in January that eased some of the most dramatic price hikes. Still, Grijalva said her farm had faced a potential property tax increase of several thousand dollars before the revisions were put on hold Monday.
“We would quit cattle ranching, it would make no financial sense,” she said. 
Among the methods used by UConn was mailing more than 1,000 postcards to farmers with a QR code that would allow them to fill out a survey online. The postcards yielded only 42 responses. The university’s researchers also emailed farmers who had participated in previous surveys, and sent copies of the surveys directly to local assessors, who shared them with farmers, which yielded better results.
The researchers received information about just 145 rental or lease agreements, out of an estimated 5,000 farms in Connecticut. Even among those who did respond to the survey, nearly half reported bartering or relying on other forms of no-cash agreements in exchange for land.
Shannon Chatfield, who owns the Stead Farm in Barkhamsted, said she was among those who never received notice of the survey. She was critical of the methods officials used to reach farmers.
“A lot of [farmers] are older, they’re not going to use QR codes, they’re not going to go online,” Chatfield said. “We don’t even read our emails half the time, so unless it comes in paper form, directly in the mail, we’re not going to see it.”
At Tuesday’s forum, Grijalva — the cattle farmer — was one of several speakers who said the controversy had shaken trust among farmers in the Department of Agriculture and its leader, Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt.
“Farms should not have to hire a lobbying agency like the Farm Bureau to protect them from the agency created to support them,” she said. 
Hurlburt, who did not attend the forum Tuesday, later acknowledged flaws in the survey despite what he said were extra efforts by the agency to boost response rates. When asked about the criticism of his leadership, he said the agency had worked hard to build a rapport with farmers and expand the amount of grant funding available to develop agriculture.
“I think the reality is that we were listening and we heard, and we took the only corrective action that we could,” Hurlburt said, referring to the decision to rescind the proposed assessments. 
A spokesman for Lamont’s office said Tuesday that the governor remains supportive of Hurlburt and has no plans to make a change in leadership at the agency. 
Larson, the Farm Bureau president, also expressed support for Hurlburt and said the agency and OPM had engaged in lengthy discussions with the Farm Bureau that resulted in both the January revisions and, ultimately, the decision to forgo any changes this year. 
Looking forward, he said the state would have to reexamine its methodology for reaching out to farmers and using self-reported information to calculate assessments under PA-490.
“Can we actually rely on the old system of farmers actually having the time to sit down and fill out a fairly extensive survey? Probably not,” Larson said. “So we have to probably come up with other mechanisms for getting that data.”
Hurlburt said it would likely take up to two years for the working group to come up with its recommendations for improving the assessment process. Depending on what they propose, he said that lawmakers may need to codify those changes through legislation. 
Harding, the Republican leader, said he would like to see the working group move more quickly, something he said could be achieved by leaning more heavily on the input from working farmers. 
“I think if we listened to [farmers] more we would have a good result for everybody, a fair result for everybody and, frankly, a quicker result,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0114_SR_FarmerAssessment_285-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

Gov. Phil Scott, long a proponent of nuclear energy, threw his weight behind a bill Tuesday that could usher in a comeback for nuclear in 2026.
“There’s a better way to lower energy prices and reduce emissions much faster if you’re willing to work with us to change course,” Scott told lawmakers in his budget address on Tuesday.
The governor voiced support for ideas included in H. 601, a bill introduced by House Minority Leader Rep. Pattie McCoy, R-Poultney, earlier this month. That bill would alter an existing state law — the Renewable Energy Standard – that requires all Vermont utilities to reach 100% renewable energy like solar and wind by 2035. Under the bill, the law would be renamed the Clean Energy Standard and would include zero-emission sources of energy like nuclear power.

The standard in place today is inflexible, Scott told lawmakers Tuesday. He urged them to adopt his administration’s proposal that could get utilities to “100% clean energy by 2030 at a substantially lower cost,” he said.
“It’s time we join other northeastern states who have already recognized that proven renewable and clean sources like solar, hydro and yes, even nuclear, must be part of the solution,” Scott said. 
The changes could lower Vermont’s renewable energy requirement from 100% for most utilities by 2030 to 75% by 2032, according to the bill. Rep. Kathleen James, D-Manchester, chair of the House Energy and Digital Infrastructure Committee heard testimony on the proposed Clean Energy Standard last spring. Estimates provided by the Department of Public Service indicated that rolling back the requirements and allowing utilities to get credit for buying nuclear power would save about $4 million a year, out of the roughly $1 billion Vermont spends on electricity every year, according to James. 
That would save between 20 to 38 cents off a monthly electric bill of $95, James said, or up to $4.50 per year for the average Vermonter, assuming all the savings go directly to ratepayers.
Low-income Vermonters have struggled with their electric bills. Vermonters face some of the highest energy burdens in the nation, some paying 10% of their income on their energy, Scott said in his address. Utility disconnections because people can’t pay their bills have increased 31% between 2022 and 2025, according to the Public Service Department. When Scott’s office was asked whether $4.50 in annual savings justified nuclear initiatives, VTDigger was referred to the Public Service Department for an explanation on the numbers. 
“Some have said that higher electricity and heating costs are the price we must pay to fight climate change,” Scott said in his speech. “I just don’t believe that’s true.” 
The bill would open the door to nuclear in other ways, James said. “Importantly, H. 601 would repeal current law that gives the legislature the ability to approve or deny the construction of any new nuclear power plant in our state,” James said, which could “make room for more nuclear power plants like Seabrook in New Hampshire and Millstone in Connecticut.”
In addition, the bill could undo a 2006 law requiring public engagement around new nuclear plants in Vermont. It could also make changes to nuclear waste storage at the state’s former nuclear site, potentially allowing in waste from other states. 
Back in 2010, Scott was one of only four state senators who were in favor of relicensing the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station. At the time, he told VTDigger that nuclear power should be part of a mix of energy sources that included renewables like wind, hydropower and solar energy. 
For decades, Vermont has pushed energy efficiency and weatherization efforts to lower the bills of homeowners and renters. But while Scott linked the high bills to the state’s efforts to lower carbon emissions, others blame the high costs on the state’s continued reliance on heating oil and propane. 
“We’ve got among the highest percentage of our residents using oil and propane for heating in the nation, which are two of the most expensive heating sources you can use,” said Ben Walsh, climate and energy program director at Vermont Public Interest Research Group, an environmental advocacy organization. “That’s why we’ve been pushing so hard for so long to invest more in helping Vermontes reduce their usage of and spending on fossil fuels.”
The administration’s current proposal relies on zero-carbon sources like nuclear to replace fossil fuels, including introducing the possibility of new nuclear plants more than a decade after the last one closed. 
The state’s only nuclear plant, the 650-megawatt Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station, once produced more than a third of the state’s electricity before closing in 2014, outcompeted by cheap natural gas and opposed by decades of anti-nuclear activism. The plant is expected to be completely decommissioned by the end of the year, four years ahead of schedule, according to a September report. 
Energy production left about 1,000 tons of nuclear waste behind that will remain at the site indefinitely. Right now, the Trump administration’s Energy Department is looking for a temporary place to store the nation’s stranded nuclear waste, including beginning conversations with communities like Vernon.

That was the chant of the hundreds who gathered at the 195 District Park near downtown Providence Tuesday as part of a nationwide protest on the one-year anniversary of President Donald Trump’s second term.
Organizers estimated upward of 400 demonstrators came out for Providence’s portion of the “Day of Action” against Trump’s policies, even amid frigid temperatures that saw a high of 18 degrees. Wind conditions made it feel like 10 degrees.
“This administration has shown us exactly who they are,” Maya Lehrer, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, told the crowd. “Trump is attacking us on every front — his administration is ripping families apart, they’re cutting vital aid for heating and food, letting health care costs rise, accelerating environmental destruction, and threatening the world.”
Protestors’ primary focus was on ending U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Rhode Island — repeatedly shouting the agency is “not welcome here.”
Newport resident Stefanie Gallo told Rhode Island Current the nation is at a turning point. She said she has been concerned about immigration officers’ constant presence outside of courthouses.
“In Newport, almost every Thursday and Friday, they circle our courthouse,” she told Rhode Island Current. “And in Providence it’s every single day.”
Gallo said she was especially taken aback when she learned about ICE officers entering the state-owned Garrahy Judicial Complex on Dorrance Street on Jan. 15, bypassing security.
“That was crazy,” she said.
Cindy Capra of Barrington came with a green sign that called ICE “Trump’s Gestapo.”
“ICE is wreaking havoc in cities all over the country and I want to protest that in my community,” she said in an interview.
Following speeches from local religious and community leaders, advocates marched across the pedestrian bridge over the Providence River chanting, “ICE is not welcome here.”

Wanda Brownlee Paige, D-Kansas City, left, and Rep. Dale Helwig, R-Columbus, gather insights Tuesday during a House committee discussion about an audit of student enrollment in the free-lunch program at public schools and implications for how much the state allocates to districts to serve needs of at-risk students. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Members of the Kansas House Welfare Reform Committee debated Tuesday implications of a jarring state audit that estimated 54% to 72% of Kansas students enrolled in the statewide free-lunch school program were ineligible during the 2023-2024 academic year.
If that assessment was accurate, the Legislature’s auditors said, the U.S. Department of Agriculture overpaid Kansas school districts $10 million to $14 million during that year for meals that shouldn’t have been subsidized. The report held implications beyond the cost of school meals, because enrollment in Kansas’ free-lunch program determined how much the state paid school districts to deliver services to at-risk students. Auditors said $38 million to $53 million in extra at-risk funding was apparently distributed to school districts due to enrollment problems with the free-lunch program.
Rep. Francis Awerkamp, a St. Marys Republican and chairman of the committee, said the audit would be useful to the committee as it sorted out questions about oversight and fraud in state or federal programs.
“One of the discussions we often have is, you know, should there be more oversight on welfare programs or less oversight? If there is fraud or is there not fraud?” he said.
The state auditors issued one recommendation for the Legislature: Consider an alternate method of calculating how much at-risk student aid should be paid annually to K-12 districts. Auditors concluded that figures of the children taking part in the free-lunch program “may no longer be an accurate measure for determining the number of students at risk of academic failure in a district.”
Rep. Charlotte Esau, R-Olathe, said that as a child her family probably would have qualified for a school lunch program, but her father refused to apply. She said she wasn’t an at-risk student, despite being part of a lower-income family. She told House colleagues it made sense to find a new method of calculating state appropriations for students struggling academically.
“I’m seeing your conclusion makes logical sense to me,” Esau told auditors.
Under existing Kansas law, no mechanism exists to claw back from school districts any overpayment of at-risk dollars. In most cases, individual school districts didn’t have access to information that would confirmed which students qualified for the free-lunch program. The state’s ability to evaluate applicants was constrained by accuracy of information gathered by several state agencies and rules enforced by the USDA limiting annual auditing to 3% of a district’s student applications or a maximum of 3,000 students in a district.
Rep. Alexis Simmons, D-Topeka, warned House colleagues eager to reform the at-risk funding formula for schools by relying on a different metric of poverty and need. She said there was a strong connection between feeding students during the school day and the ability to learn in the classroom.
Simmons said it would be a mistake to assume fraud when state auditors said it was challenging to verify whether students were eligible for free lunches at school.
State auditor Heidi Zimmerman said the report published in July outlined federal overpayments to school districts for the free lunch program. The audit also linked that idea to state overpayments to school districts for at-risk education, she said.
“We cannot claim there was fraud,” Zimmerman said. “We can tell you there are students who are ineligible. Ineligibility is not the same as fraud. Fraud requires a specific intent. You might have just made a mistake. That’s not fraud. So, this report does not claim that we found fraud anywhere.”
“Very much appreciate that clarification,” Simmons said.
Rep. Wanda Brownlee Paige, D-Kansas City, said the audit didn’t take into account the lower literacy rate among some parents expected to fill out school lunch program applications. She said the Kansas minimum wage of $7.25 per hour — less than half the $15 per hour minimum wage in Missouri — exacerbated financial hardships faced by families desperate for government assistance in providing nutritional meals to their school-age children.
“I can see a whole lot of people struggling,” she said. “The kids are hungry.”
Rep. Brian Bergkamp, R-Wichita, asked Frank Harwood, deputy commissioner of the Kansas Department of Education, to provide the committee with statistics on the quantity of food thrown away in Kansas public school cafeterias. He said the amount was more than most people might realize.
Harwood said USDA reimbursed school districts only for meals served to an eligible student. Under federal law, he said, children automatically qualified for free meals if they were in a household receiving benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Medicaid or food distribution programs on an Indian reservation.

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — The Medical University of South Carolina’s hospital system will need take on more debt and privately fundraise to achieve its ambitions of opening a top-tier cancer center in downtown Charleston.
MUSC Health plans to raise $200 million in charitable donations to help pay for the planned new cancer hospital, medical college president David Cole told a House budget panel. It also will need to finance another chunk of funding — how much is yet to be determined — adding to the state-owned hospital system’s growing mound of debt.
All of that is on top of the $350 million in taxpayer dollars the hospital system is asking legislators to provide in the state budget for the fiscal year starting July 1. Gov. Henry McMaster, in his budget proposal, recommends the state chip in just $150 million.
The hospital’s governing board in April approved the plan to chase a Comprehensive Cancer Center designation from the National Cancer Institute but did not say at the time how much the effort would cost. MUSC Health expects to finalize estimates for the project’s total price tag in the coming weeks, CEO Patrick Cawley told the SC Dailey Gazette.
The MUSC hospital system already had about $828 million in long-term debt on the books, according to the agency’s latest annual financial report.
In April, a state fiscal oversight board gave the system permission to borrow $860 million more: $400 million to build a hospital and cancer center in Summerville’s mega Nexton community, $330 million to build a hospital in Indian Land (the unincorporated panhandle of Lancaster County), and $130 million to finance the equipment for both.
So far, MUSC appears only to have cashed in on the Indian Land project, issuing that bond in December, according to a national database.
And in October, MUSC finalized a deal with Tidelands Health to take a controlling interest in the Grand Strand area hospitals. The deal involved no cash exchange, but MUSC takes on the financial risk at Tidelands, which has been operating at a $50 million deficit.
The cancer hospital, which Cole called MUSC’s “number one priority,” could further inflate those debt numbers.
If approved, the center would be the first of its kind in South Carolina. Patients seeking this top level of care currently must travel out of state to centers in North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee.
“There’s no reason in the future for a South Carolinian, if you have a cancer diagnosis, to leave the state for best-in-class care,” Cole said. “We should be able to build and deliver the best care possible for our citizens. And we’ve had a lot of partners that are lining up to help us make this a reality.”
MUSC’s current cancer hospital holds a tier-two designation as a Clinical Cancer Center. The bump in rankings could mean a bump in National Cancer Institute research grant support.
The existing center already boasts more than 230 researchers with a more than $50 million portfolio and more than 200 clinical trials, according to the hospital system’s budget request.
To reach the next level, the cancer center must increase the depth and breadth of its research and broaden its community reach.
MUSC would apply for its designation in 2028 and the center would open in 2030.
The hospital system has said it anticipates a “strong” return on the investment but has yet to provide further financial details.
South Carolina is below the national rate in terms of number of cancer cases, according to National Cancer Institute data, but the state has a higher mortality rate from the deadly disease.
Cole, citing U.S. Centers for Disease Control data, said MUSC expects the number of cancer cases to rise by 20% over the next five years.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lung-cancer-concept-1024x666.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

A mother whose toddler died in a rear-end collision applauded a bill that cleared the Kentucky Senate Tuesday as “planting a seed” for “better behavior on our roads.” 

 SB 28 progress


The measure would expand the state’s no texting while driving laws as a means to reduce distracted driving. 
Alyssa Burns, whose daughter Camberleigh died days before her second birthday in a 2022 crash, told the Lantern, “I just hope that this gives Kentuckians the wake up call that there are people who are tired of you infringing on our right to a safe passage from point A to point B. My daughter’s right to life was stolen from her.” 
Burns said Kentuckians who are driving with distractions, like cell phones and games, should think about potentially endangering others on the road. “I am imploring people: Why are we waiting for it to be someone you love for us to care?” 
A Ford F-350 slammed into the back of the vehicle in which Burns and her daughter were traveling on Interstate 71 in Louisville. Burns’ daughter was buckled into a child seat in the back. Burns and her fiancé who was driving suffered serious injuries. Louisville police determined the pickup driver was  “not properly watching the roadway ahead” and listed driver “inattention” as the only contributing factor, reports WHAS. The driver of the pickup was not charged.
Senate Bill 28, or “the Phone-Down Kentucky Act,” says drivers cannot hold a cell phone while driving to send electronic messages, like texts and emails, or watch moving images, like videos and games. 
Drivers who violate the legislation could face $100 fines starting in late October. Fines assessed under the legislation will be divided among a traumatic brain injury trust fund, the Kentucky trauma care system fund and a veterans’ program fund.
The Senate approved the bill Tuesday afternoon, with 31 votes in favor and seven Republicans voting against it. The House must now weigh in on the legislation before it can become law. 
The Senate Transportation Committee gave unanimous approval to the bill last week. 
The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Jimmy Higdon, R-Lebanon, has said the bill is a priority for him to pass in his final legislative session, as he won’t be seeking reelection this year. 
“This is about saving lives, plain and simple,” Higdon said in a press release after the Senate passed the legislation. “This bill won’t bring Camberleigh back, and it won’t bring justice to the person responsible for her death, but it is an opportunity for us to honor her, and finally do the right thing by putting the Phone Down Kentucky Act into law.”
Burns testified in favor of the bill before an interim legislative committee last year.
Some lawmakers did have questions on the Senate floor about the bill. Sen. Brandon Smith, R-Hazard, said constituents asked him whether drivers would face an additional fine if police officers pull them over for one infraction, like speeding, and then see a cell phone in the car. Higdon replied that an officer cannot stop a person for violating the bill without having “visually observed” them using their phone behind the wheel. Smith later voted in favor of the bill, but added that he would like to see the bill made clearer later in the legislative process. 
Senate Majority Whip Mike Wilson, R-Bowling Green, recalled coming across an accident on his way home where a motorcyclist had been run over by a car. He said the driver of the car had been looking at their phone. Wilson himself has long ridden motorcycles and has heard that most accidents involving motorcycles are not caused by the motorcyclist, but drivers who do not see them. 
“I think it’s a matter of safety, and especially looking at my motorcycle clubs, my friends, I agree with them, and they’ve asked for this for a long time, so I’m happy to vote aye,” Wilson said. 
One of the senators who voted against the bill, Sen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, explained  that he was “sympathetic” to Wilson’s comments and said  he sees collision avoidance technology in autonomous vehicles or cars with driver assistance improving in the future. He noted that distracted driving can include moments when a driver isn’t using a phone, but is eating, drinking or talking to another passenger in the car. 
Williams said he thinks technology has  “the potential to save as many lives as seat belts have saved in the future, because … the collision avoidance braking system — it never rests,” Williams said. “It never is distracted. It’s looking on the road.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1HL0280-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

(Photo illustration by Iowa Capital Dispatch with main image by Getty Images; advertisement from U.S. District Court records)A 23-year-old Iowa man who has lived in the United States since he was a year old was detained by federal immigration agents and jailed in Muscatine County while being unlawfully denied a bond hearing, a federal judge has ruled.
The ruling comes in a civil case where the federal government’s efforts to hire “deportation judges” — normally referred to as immigration judges — is alleged by the plaintiff to be part of an effort to hire judges whose views align with President Donald Trump’s political goals.
The case involves Giovanni Uribe-Gonzalez, 23, of Hawkeye, who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in November 2025 after a drunken driving arrest and then placed in the Muscatine County Jail pending possible deportation.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to court filings by Uribe-Gonzalez’s attorney, Amy Cummings, he was brought to the United States by his mother when he was 1 year old.
“As toddler, he took his first steps on Iowa soil, and he learned to read and write in Iowa classrooms where he was always liked by his peers and teachers. He recited the Pledge of Allegiance each morning and cheered the fireworks every Fourth of July,” Cummings told a federal judge last month. “His every recollection and dream starts and ends in the Hawkeye state, and his identity, values and culture were forged here shaping him into a quintessential American Midwesterner.”
Cummings told the court that in 2021 Uribe-Gonzalez’s family had saved enough money to pay his $495 filing fee for citizenship under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Act (DACA). While the government accepted the fee, Cummings alleged, it never fully processed his application and that matter is still pending with no final action taken.
After graduating from West Central High School in Maynard, Uribe-Gonzalez enrolled in a training program for railroad welders, earned his certification, applied for jobs and was then rejected due to his citizenship status. In 2025, he was twice arrested for drunken driving, with both arrests resulting in a conviction on a charge of first-offense drunken driving.
Court records show that after his second arrest in November, he was detained Chickasaw County, where ICE placed a hold on him, preventing his release although an Iowa judge had allowed him to post bond.
According to the court records, David Bindert, an Iowa-based deportation officer with ICE, noted in his written report of the detention that Uribe-Gonzalez had a DACA application pending, but added that Uribe-Gonzalez had “no legal presence in the United States” and was subject to being detained by ICE.
Uribe-Gonzalez was then taken to the Muscatine County Jail for holding, and ICE initiated deportation proceedings.
Attorney cites ad for ‘deportation judges’ 
As with thousands of other ICE detainees across the country in 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice took the position that the federal law providing for the mandatory detention of detainees applies not just to people who apprehended at the border — which is how the law has been interpreted and applied for decades — but also to people who may have entered the country illegally months or years earlier.
The DOJ’s new mandatory-detention stance has resulted in immigration judges across the country denying detainees the opportunity to argue for release on bond while their case is pending.
Since July 2025, more than 300 U.S. District Court judges in 1,600 cases have rejected that argument, finding the new interpretation of the law is contrary to ICE’s own regulations, its published enforcement guidelines, previous court rulings, and “the overall logic” of the nation’s immigration system.
Despite those rulings, ICE and county jails in Iowa and the rest of the country have continued to hold individuals for indefinite periods without affording them the opportunity to argue for their release on bond. The cases where those practices have been rejected are those in which the detainees have taken their case to U.S. District Court and argued their due process rights are being violated.
On Dec. 16, 2025, Cummings filed such a lawsuit on behalf of Uribe-Gonzalez in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, naming President Trump, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and others as the respondents.
As part of her petition seeking a bond hearing for her client, Cummings noted that the federal government has fired dozens of immigration judges and then advertised for “deportation judges” that Cummings argues are intended to “better align” with Trump’s political goals.
As an exhibit in her case, she submitted a copy of the federal government’s written solicitation for applicants for the position of “deportation judge.”
The solicitation says: “YOU BE THE JUDGE. Help write the next chapter of America. Apply today to become a deportation judge and you may be entitled to these benefits: $159,951 to $207,500 per year… DEFINE AMERICA FOR GENERATIONS… Preside over cases in federal Immigration Court and determine whether an alien has to leave the United States or gets to stay. Make decisions with generational consequences… Restore integrity and honor to our Nation’s Immigration Court system.” 
Recently, U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher ruled in Uribe-Gonzalez’s favor on the bond-hearing issue, noting that district courts across the nation have ruled that such detainees are entitled to a hearing at which they can argue for their release.
The available court records don’t indicate whether such a hearing has been held.

Spencer Cox held a press conference to present his budget proposal at the Salt Lake County Library in Kearns on Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)There is a tragedy unfolding right before our eyes, every single day. It may not make the headlines, but it affects thousands of Utah residents. For many, it will define the course of the rest of their lives. What is this tragedy? It is the fact that thousands of impoverished children are growing up without the benefits of an education. Intergenerational poverty trends show that, unfortunately, many of these will go on to raise their own families in poverty.
These children deserve better, and their future children deserve better. Education is among the most important influences in the development of a child. Receiving an education is the most effective way to escape intergenerational poverty, and a quality education provides children with support and resources that have a huge impact on not only their economic trajectory, but their moral character as well.
Now, I don’t think anyone will argue against the fact that an education is important. In fact, I think most people would agree that it is one of the most crucial elements of childhood. But if that’s true, then why do we, as a society, make it such a low priority? Why does Utah consistently score in the bottom of the nation for per-pupil education spending?
Maybe the problem is that we just aren’t aware of why increased funding for schools is important. Maybe we tend to think that schools already receive enough funding. I mean, it’s not like kids are being turned away at the doors because the school just can’t afford to take them in, right?
The problem isn’t that children don’t have access to education, the problem is whether they are really benefitting from that education. For kids who come from affluent households, this isn’t much of an issue. When they go home, they have the full support of their parents.
For children raised in poverty, it is far less likely that they are receiving the support they need. They may only have the support of one single parent, who has to work long hours or multiple jobs and, by no fault of their own, barely has the time and resources to provide the necessities.
For these kids, it may not matter that they are going to school, they simply aren’t receiving the benefits. When a child grows up in poverty or other adverse situations, their cognitive development is slowed, and they fall behind in school early on. Research shows that a student who is not a proficient reader by the third grade is four times as likely to drop out of high school.
This is where school funding comes in. Increased funding can support a host of areas — these may not be so crucial for affluent families, but they have the potential to make a huge difference for impoverished families.
More funding could allow for greater intervention for underprivileged students, picking up the slack for hard-working parents and resolving the issue of delayed brain development. More funding could go toward improving the quality of overall education, or it could mean increasing the pay of teachers, bringing more teachers to Utah.
More funding would also allow for greater amount and quality of extracurricular activities. This would address another issue that stems from living in poverty: lack of social capital. Social capital refers to connections that improve financial, social, and emotional aspects of life.
Participation in extracurricular activities provides the opportunity for mentors and positive role models, as well as lasting connections with peers. Social capital is very useful for escaping intergenerational poverty, and a boost to extracurriculars could have a huge positive impact on impoverished children.
These are only a few examples of what an increase to school funding could mean. Hopefully you can see why this is such a big deal. So, what should be done? You may have heard that Gov. Spencer Cox’s budget proposal for 2027 includes $654.2 million for public education. This is a step in the right direction. Still, more positive change is needed. The Utah Education Association (UEA) asks that funding be increased to at least 2% above inflation in order to meet the needs of students and public educators.
Change requires the action of thousands of people just like you and me. Perhaps the most important step we can take, and one of the most overlooked, is to simply be an active participant in local government. I urge you to consider how you can do your part to support education, the children desperately need you.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/120325_Gov.-Budget_14-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

Approximately 100 demonstrators, mostly students, shouted chants like “keep the Capitol out of the classroom” and “our school won’t be sold” as they marched past popular campus landmarks like Old Main Lawn and the Greek Theatre in support of Emily Suski.
UPDATED: University of Arkansas withdraws incoming law dean’s offer in wake of Republican complaints

The university received national attention last week when officials withdrew an offer to Suski following complaints from key Arkansas Republicans about her background and legal positions on transgender athletes. Suski is a University of South Carolina law professor and Title IX expert.
The decision to rescind the offer less than a week after announcing Suski’s selection sparked concerns about violating academic freedom and chilling faculty speech, complaints echoed during Tuesday’s student-led protest. 
During the dean search, third-year law student Addison Brooks said students and faculty met with candidates and provided feedback. 
The “overwhelming attitude” of faculty and staff was that Suski was “the best fit.” However, the decision to rescind her offer shows their opinions didn’t matter, Brooks said.
“There were people whose voices were more important to them than ours, and that’s really upsetting, and I think that that should upset anyone in the state who values public discourse, a strong education system and an unafraid legal profession,” she said. “If they can do it to us, they can do it to anyone.”
There were 376 students enrolled in the law school as of the fall semester. A university official did not immediately return a request for comment on the protest. 
The Arkansas Student Bar Association expressed concerns about the message the decision sends to students in a statement issued Tuesday. 
“To suggest that a prospective dean’s prior legal positions would ‘indoctrinate’ students is to both fundamentally misunderstand legal education and insult the intellectual capacity of the student body,” the statement reads.

Brooks and her classmates, collectively known as Arkansas Law Students for Academic Freedom, organized Tuesday’s event, which included a roughly one-mile march around the campus. 
At the end of the march, protestors gathered outside the student union where demonstrators said they’ve felt sad, angry, fearful and overwhelmed over the situation. 
Participants argued it doesn’t matter whether people agreed with Suski’s legal opinion. The issue is protecting free speech, which they said is being eroded if lawyers have to be concerned about retaliation for expressing a legal opinion or defending a client with viewpoints that lawmakers disagree with.
People are afraid to discuss the job revocation itself, according to third-year law student Steven Jacobs, who said the university’s decision devalues their law degrees and undermines the integrity of the legal profession in Arkansas. 
“This is an assault on academic independence from an increasingly paternalist government, and it’s an insult to our school, our profession and us as students for the state to say that it knows what’s best for us,” Jacobs said. 
Arkansas Law Students for Academic Freedom called for an independent review of the hiring process and the adoption of a policy protecting university personnel decisions from “undisclosed government pressure.”
The law students’ demands have been written in a formal letter that will be delivered to the university’s administration, Brooks said. 
The concern reverberates beyond the law school. Ted Swedenburg, a professor emeritus in anthropology and Middle East Studies, said he was “gobsmacked” to learn about the university’s decision, which “potentially destroys the integrity and independence of the university,” and instills fear. 
Freedom of speech increasingly has been challenged at higher education institutions across the country, Swedenburg said, including at the University of Arkansas, which removed its Middle East center director in December following statements about Israel. Her attorney raised concerns about political pressure after state senators issued a statement about her discipline, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
“When I come back and talk to my faculty friends, they’re demoralized by all these things,” Swedenburg said.
The decision to withdraw Suski’s offer will severely hinder the university’s ability to recruit students, faculty and administrators, Brooks said.
“What dean wants to come here now?” she said. “If professors around the nation see what our legislature is capable of when they don’t get their way, who wants to come here and be in charge of the next generation of attorneys?”

Hydro Electric Plant No.2, built in 1917, in Spearfish Canyon. (Photo courtesy of the Governor's Office)The South Dakota House of Representatives sent a bill to the Senate by a vote of 60-9 on Tuesday that would transfer an old hydroelectric plant in Spearfish Canyon to a foundation for potential conversion to an interpretive center.
The bill would transfer ownership of the Homestake Mine Hydro Electric Plant No. 2 building from the South Dakota Game, Fish, and Parks to the Spearfish Canyon Foundation at no cost. The building is near the entrance to the popular Devil’s Bathtub hiking trail. 
Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, called the building a well-preserved “time capsule” that would turn into a place where visitors can learn about the history of mining in Lawrence County.
“It’s like they greased everything in 1916 and they just walked away,” Odenbach told fellow representatives in the House. 
Of the bill’s “no” votes, two came from Rep. Phil Jensen, R-Rapid City, and Rep. Tina Mulally, R-Rapid City. The two argued the state was giving away taxpayer assets without compensation.
Odenbach said the building and the land it sits on are of little value, and they cost the state money to maintain.

Scott Simpson, deputy secretary for the Department of Game, Fish, and Parks, told the House Agriculture and Natural Resource Committee last week that the property became the department’s as part of a larger 2014 acquisition from Homestake Mining Co., which also included Roughlock Falls and Spearfish Falls. The hydro plant formerly generated electricity for the Homestake Mine in Lead. The mine has been closed since 2001.
Simpson said the hydro plant site does not fit the department’s core mission of managing natural resources and recreation, and the foundation is better positioned to preserve and interpret the building’s Homestake-era history.
Simpson said the foundation would assume ownership and liability under the transfer, while a reversion clause would apply if the property is not used for a public purpose. The proposed transfer is 3.5 acres. 
Foundation supporters informed the committee that the building remains largely intact on the inside, but requires repairs, including roof work, to prevent further deterioration. Asked whether the foundation would return to the Legislature seeking state funding for renovations, foundation member Bob Ewing said no, explaining the group could pursue grants and local support.

Ralph Norman held a news conference Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2026, to talk about fixing South Carolina's roads. (Photo by Alexander Thompson/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman returned to the Statehouse on Tuesday to talk roads and bridges as he seeks to pull his gubernatorial campaign into the fast lane.
Norman, who represented Rock Hill in the state House for a decade, made the pitch for his proposal to audit the state Department of Transportation, put the lieutenant governor in charge of the $2.8 billion department, and transfer smaller roads to counties to maintain. All of his ideas would require the Legislature’s approval.
And legislators are busy at work on their own proposal. A House study committee has been meeting since last summer.
The 5th District congressman has made roads and bridges a centerpiece of his campaign in hopes an issue that South Carolinians universally complain about will help him stand out from his four GOP competitors.
The proposals Norman touted Tuesday have largely been part of his platform since he launched his campaign six months ago. But the ultra-conservative congressman took the Statehouse stop — his second in two weeks — as an opportunity to bash the powers that be in Columbia and angle for the outsider status that’s much coveted in a GOP primary.
“Sadly, many who serve in these chambers don’t seem to care about what their constituents are telling them. That’s going to change under a Norman administration,” he said, as five state
representatives from the breakaway House Freedom Caucus stood behind him.

Norman, a member of the Freedom Caucus in the U.S. House, helped launch the state House affiliate in 2022 that has publicly feuded with the GOP majority.
South Carolina’s roads, which Norman said are in “crisis,” have long been among voters’ chief complaints and a political punchline.
The federal Bureau of Transportation Statistics grades 80% of the state’s roads as being in acceptable condition, putting South Carolina 31st in the nation, while the state vies with other southern states for the highest rate of traffic deaths per vehicle mile, according to the National Safety Council.
Thousands of the state’s bridges are in need of repair, to which incumbent Gov. Henry McMaster has repeatedly called legislators’ attention. The Republican governor’s budget recommendations for the upcoming fiscal year include putting $1.1 billion toward roadwork to cover inflationary costs that threaten to delay projects, as has happened in other states.
Norman’s central pitch to pothole-weary voters is that he can improve roads faster without raising revenue.
“We’ve got all the money we need, but it’s putting money in the right places. It’s getting government out of the way, and it’s getting accountability back to an area that can’t wait any longer,” Norman told reporters at the Statehouse.
Norman declined to weigh in on McMaster’s $1.1 billion request, saying he’d need to see more details. And he didn’t mention the gas tax that, as a state legislator, he fiercely opposed raising.
To find more cash, Norman hopes to pay for an independent audit of the department, in addition to the internal audits required yearly. He also believes the lieutenant governor should lead the department, as he contends a political figure would be more accountable to voters than a secretary who answers to an appointed governing board.
Making the lieutenant governor “road czar,” in Norman’s terms, would give the part-time position a defined job and once again rejigger the department’s management — if the Legislature approves the idea.
Changing the agency’s governing structure has been a popular thing for lawmakers to focus on while insisting roads can be fixed for no additional money.
In 2007, a restructuring law made the DOT a Cabinet agency and gave the governor the power to appoint its director. Advocates for reform complained that legislators had too much influence over which projects got done, since they determined who sat on the agency’s governing board. The law made the secretary answer to two bosses: the governor and the legislatively appointed commission. A 2010 outside audit found the law actually increased inefficiencies.
In 2016, then-Gov. Nikki Haley reluctantly signed a law that, along with letting the state borrow money for road improvements, removed the agency from the Cabinet and returned control to the commission. However, it let the governor pick the commissioners — if legislators approve.
It wasn’t until Haley, who had repeatedly promised to veto any increase to gas taxes, left to join the Trump administration that the Legislature managed to agree on a road-funding plan that raised the gas tax by 12 cents over six years, to 28 cents a gallon, where it remains. Legislators knew at the time that the compromise raised far less than the DOT said it needed to bring existing roads to good condition.
While Norman was a Haley ally who consistently voted to uphold her vetoes, he didn’t vote on that law. He resigned from the state House in order to concentrate on his successful bid for Congress two weeks before the first vote on the House floor.
In his budget recommendations, McMaster noted that almost $7 billion worth of roadway projects are underway in South Carolina, compared to $2.7 billion in 2017 when the law passed.
“The department is hitting the marks that we set out to do back in 2017,” Secretary Justin Powell said at a Statehouse hearing in August, adding that the extra revenue has led to a significant
improvement in road quality.
But a decade later, the DOT is also dealing with faster growth than expected and the resulting traffic headaches that drive up complaints.
Norman proposes handing off smaller state roads to county management — an idea that’s been around for decades without much success. He didn’t say whether he’s willing to offer financial aid for the transfers.
South Carolina has the nation’s fourth-largest state-maintained highway system, at more than 41,000 centerline miles. The state is responsible for nearly 70% of public roads, including what’s called farm-to-market roads and many neighborhood streets. Some are essentially glorified driveways.
But historically, local governments have balked at the idea of taking on more roads and the expenses that come with that additional responsibility. The agency is seeking $25 million in the upcoming budget for a road-buyback program that offers local governments money in exchange for taking a road. It’s seeking permission from the Legislature to negotiate those deals.
Norman’s not the only gubernatorial candidate claiming he’ll do a better job fixing roads.
While Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette has touted the state’s progress under the McMaster administration, the other candidates have struck a critical tone similar to Norman’s.
Congresswoman Nancy Mace of Charleston County is also proposing an audit in her platform, while state Attorney General Alan Wilson pointed to cutting “massive” waste at the department in an August interview.
The details of the candidates’ plans remain vague, and Norman didn’t change that on Tuesday.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ralph-Norman-DOT-newser-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

(Photo courtesy of the SC State Ports Authority)MOUNT PLEASANT — The Port of Charleston is largely bucking national trends with cargo levels that are roughly flat year over year, despite tariffs and global trade uncertainties, port officials said Tuesday.
A total of 689,350 cargo containers of all sizes moved through the port’s terminals during the first six months of the 2026 fiscal year, which started July 1. That compares to 692,770 containers during the same July-through-December period a year earlier.
Byron Miller, chief commercial officer for the S.C. State Ports Authority, said the average cargo decline at all U.S. ports is projected at 4%. The National Retail Federation has a better outlook, predicting the nation’s ports will see only a slight, less than 1 percent, decline for 2025.
“So, in sum, 2025 was a year of great uncertainty,” Miller told the authority’s board of directors. “Many shippers deferred decisions on new facilities and new investments. However, we are very encouraged by the latter part of the year.”
Within the past 90 days, for example, a pair of major port customers — First Solar and the Cosco retail chain — announced plans for a combined $570.3 million in new or expanded South Carolina facilities.
And four industrial buildings were leased in the Charleston market during the fourth quarter, taking 2 million square feet of space off the market with customers that will add 25,000 containers a year to the port’s total.
“December was not only an active month but a very productive month commercially for the port,” Miller said. “While the outcome may remain a little bit muted for 2026 for trade volumes, this gives us great reason to be encouraged about what lies ahead in our market.”
Micah Mallace, the authority’s president and CEO, said in a news release that the agency is “preparing to see weaker volumes continue into 2026 but remain hopeful that the industry will stabilize some time next year.”
Southeast ports, like Charleston’s, were largely able to blunt tariff and other impacts due to a growing population that has fueled the region’s economy. The Port of Savannah, which hasn’t yet reported December totals, was on target to notch a slight increase in cargo for 2025.
Other ports saw their cargo levels fall.
The Port of Virginia, for example, recorded an 8 % drop. All told, the retail group said national cargo levels are expected to trail year-over-year numbers at least through this spring.
The first few months of the year are typically slow for ports nationwide, and there is uncertainty over how the rest of 2026 will play out.
“As 2026 begins, we see a world increasingly focused on protecting domestic industries and addressing perceived trade imbalances,” Ben Hackett, founder of maritime industry consultant Hackett Associates, said in a written statement. “This approach has raised questions about the future of free trade and international economic cooperation.”
Jonathan Gold, the retail federation’s vice president for supply chain and customs policy, said retailers are hoping for more stability.
“Especially regarding tariffs and trade policy … to help ensure better supply chain operations to meet consumer needs,” Gold said in a statement.
In addition to the updated cargo outlook, the authority is winding down its cruise ship business at Union Pier Terminal in downtown Charleston ahead of selling the property to Lowcountry developer and businessman Ben Navarro.
The authority’s cruise calendar shows eight vessels will make 26 port-of-call visits to Union Pier through July 4, with no further cruise ships scheduled beyond Independence Day. That will bring an end to regular cruise ship visits that began in 2010 with Carnival Cruise Line offering year-round journeys. Carnival left the Charleston market at the end of 2024.
Navarro’s Marti Holdings LLC plans to redevelop the roughly 65-acre Union Pier site, located between Concord Street and Charleston Harbor, beginning in 2027.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/two-ships-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A House panel advanced legislation Tuesday that would require land restoration efforts following the initial construction of electric transmission lines in Iowa. 
Under House Study Bill 526, transmission line owners would be responsible for repairing tile drainage, tilling impacted soil and reseeding cover crops or other ground cover in the easement area following construction.
Kevin Kuhle, speaking on behalf of the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, said land restoration following electric transmission projects is a “really important issue” for Iowa farmers. 
The bill language states that electric transmission owners must “restore the land to its original condition to the extent practicable.”
The Iowa Utilities Commission would implement the rules and impose civil penalties if electric transmission owners do not comply with the restoration requirements. 
Similar language was included in Gov. Kim Reynolds’ proposed energy bill from 2025, which did not make it to the floor for debate. 
Several other farm groups, and environmental groups registered in favor of the bill, while utility companies remained undecided on the bill. 
Onnalee Gettler, a lobbyist on behalf of MidAmerican Energy, suggested an amendment to the bill so that it only applied to projects from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, long-range transmission plan, “Tranche 2.1” and beyond. Gettler said these are transmission projects that were approved in July 2024, but have not yet been built. 
While HSB 526 applies only to electric transmission lines, Kuhle with Iowa Farm Bureau Federation said “it’d be great” if lawmakers extended the restoration requirements to other projects, including natural gas and liquid hazardous pipelines. 
“All of these energy projects are going to be built out, and we want to make sure landowners are respected in the process,” Kuhle said. 
The bill passed unanimously from the subcommittee, led by Rep. Shannon Latham, R-Sheffield.

House Bill 2559 would allow cities and counties, starting in April 2027, to impose a tax up to 4% on short-term rentals to raise money for affordable housing. Uses of the revenue include building new housing, maintaining existing units and providing rental assistance. 
If the bill moves forward, the fight over the proposal could be fierce.
Over the past year, Airbnb has pumped nearly $4 million into a political action committee opposing the idea in Washington. The company gave $1 million to the committee in late November. The PAC’s ads appear often on TVW, the state’s public affairs network.
State law defines short-term rentals as those provided for fewer than 30 consecutive nights, but doesn’t cover units in the same home where the owner lives, so long as fewer than three rooms are rented at a time. These rentals have exploded as an option for travelers in recent years. 
Similar legislation passed the state Senate last year without Republican support before dying in the House. Initially, that bill called for a statewide tax, but was amended to instead give local governments the option to enact the tax. A fiscal analysis of last year’s bill estimated the new tax would raise about $21 million per year for local governments.
Cities in other states, including New York City, have banned whole-home short-term rentals entirely. 
Research on the issue has been mixed.
In Irvine, California, rents decreased 3% after the city effectively banned short-term rentals, researchers found. A 2019 Harvard Business Review study concluded a 1% increase in Airbnb listings resulted in a 0.018% growth in rental rates and 0.026% uptick in home prices.
A Congressional Research Service report last year noted the economic effects of short-term rentals can be overshadowed by other forces, like zoning laws and other regulations.
In a committee hearing Tuesday, numerous Airbnb operators urged lawmakers to oppose the legislation. 
Some were older Washingtonians who said they need the income to support themselves in their retirement. And they say most of their guests who would pay the tax are Washington residents vacationing, traveling for work or families of college students. 
Thousands come for medical treatment, said Allison Moser, president of the Washington Hosts Collaborative Alliance. Moser, who owns a duplex with her husband as a short-term rental, said the collaborative represents 16,000 short-term rental operators in the state.
“They paid 30% less than for a hotel, but had the comfort and quiet of a home-like atmosphere,” she told the House Finance Committee. “Rentals invest in our community’s healthy economic environment, and we want to continue to do so.”
Counties love the idea, said Brian Enslow, policy consultant at the Washington Association of Counties. With limited options to raise affordable housing funding, they would be open to an even higher rate tax above 4%.
City leaders in tourist towns say short-term rentals are pushing up housing costs for residents, including those who work in the tourism economy. 
“Leavenworth is losing its community,” Leavenworth Mayor Carl Florea said. “Every one of these short-term rentals could be, and many of them have been, permanent housing. And now, because of the popularity, they’re used as second homes, and it takes away stock.”
“And if we don’t get a significant tool to begin to address it, we’re going to lose the community completely,” he continued.
Sean Lynn, the secretary of the hosts collaborative, manages short-term rentals in Leavenworth. He suggested a smaller across-the-board tax on all lodging types.
“A broad-based approach would avoid singling out one segment and reduce incentives to shift demand between lodging options,” Lynn said.
Local governments can currently levy a tax up to 2% on lodging, including in hotels, motels and short-term rentals. The revenue is mostly used for promoting tourism. Except in Seattle, various lodging taxes currently cannot exceed a total of 12%. Seattle can’t go over 15.2%.
The committee hasn’t scheduled a vote to move the measure forward.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1734836683-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 18:57:25.947252

One is outward facing, grounded in strong institutions and using innovation to project its ideas and  successfully compete with the nation and world. That is the Massachusetts of the China Trade, the Industrial Revolution, Route 128 and the rise of computing, and, more recently, biotechnology and the life sciences. It is the Massachusetts of growing prosperity. 
The other soul is inward looking and parochial. It focuses on protecting existing interests, tolerates rising costs, and treats competition as a threat rather than a catalyst for innovation. This is the Massachusetts of machine politics and complacency— rooted in the patronage systems of early 20th century Boston and reflected today in the outsized influence of public-sector unions. 
The state has long oscillated between these two identities. Periods of outward engagement have brought leadership; periods of retrenchment have produced stagnation and population loss. 
Today, Massachusetts is firmly in a parochial phase, reflected in policy choices over the past decade that have led to job losses, rising living costs, and outmigration of talent and investment. Since 2010, state spending has grown at two times the rate of median household income; state employee compensation costs have risen even faster. 
As a result, the state has increased fees and taxes while failing to address punitive housing, health care, and energy costs. It is unsurprising that families are leaving Massachusetts at every age and income level. Younger residents are departing at a particularly alarming rate.  
It is not just a cost-of-living issue. As Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary recently noted, Massachusetts has become uninvestible, which we see as more employers move out and stop investing in new jobs here.  Since 2020, Massachusetts has lost more than 25,000 private-sector jobs, while North Carolina—with a broadly similar industry mix and size—has added more than 250,000. Florida, New Hampshire, Tennessee, and Texas all dramatically outperform us on job growth and affordability. We lose jobs while some competitor states have grown their job base by more than 10 percent. 
Their success is no accident. Their leaders are choosing to compete—by lowering taxes, restraining health care and housing costs, and making it easier to hire, invest, and grow businesses. 
In our forthcoming book, Agenda for Leadership 2026: Choosing to Compete, we present a comprehensive 64-policy platform to restore Massachusetts to its rightful place as a national leader in education, patient care, and economic opportunity. Fiscal discipline is not a comprehensive policy vision, but the state government’s runaway spending remains a foundational obstacle to Massachusetts realizing its potential. When government expands faster than the private economy, the consequences are predictable: higher taxes, rising costs, and weaker job creation. 
Our slate of fiscal reforms is practical and measured, non-ideological, and will save the Commonwealth between $1.1 and $1.8 billion annually, while protecting essential services and strengthening long-term competitiveness.  
In just the last few years, the state workforce has grown by 5,000 FTEs and compensation has jumped far more than median household income. To address this gap, we suggest strategic attrition, leaving a small share of lower-priority positions unfilled as employees retire or move on. This approach avoids layoffs and expensive buyouts while saving taxpayers hundreds of millions.  
We suggest greater oversight of the Commonwealth’s sprawling network of quasi-public entities. That will also have the benefit of bringing transparency and accountability to organizations spending $9 billion in public funds with limited oversight.  
Other states competitively bid public services. but because of the state’s anti-competitive Pacheco Law, we do not. In the area of public construction projects, we too often use project labor agreements that exclude the majority of firms and adversely impact minority-owned businesses. Reforms in both areas would improve quality and significantly reduce costs.  
We suggest means-testing two universal benefits programs—free community college and school meals—focusing benefits on lower-income households (up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level) and eliminating subsidies for wealthier families. 
Finally, AI-enabled tools offer the potential to save a minimum of 1–2 percent of the overall budget of major benefits programs like unemployment insurance, MassHealth, and public procurement by reducing “leakage”— payment errors, administrative inefficiencies, and fraud. When resources reach the right recipients more reliably and quickly, families benefit. Leakage benefits no one. 
Like household income, local aid has grown at only a fraction of the state’s overall spending growth, so some of the savings should be directed at boosting frontline services through non-education local aid. It would also ease local pressure to raise property taxes and fees.  
The savings can also stave off additional state tax hikes or allow tax relief for families and businesses.  
Restoring Massachusetts’s leadership in education, patient care, and economic opportunity—and making Massachusetts more affordable for families and businesses alike—will require focus, discipline, and a willingness to compete.  
It is a choice Massachusetts has made before. We must make that choice again.

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)Protesters marched outside the Roundhouse late Tuesday morning decrying federal immigration policy, inaction on climate change and genocide in Gaza, saying they wanted to send a message to New Mexico’s lawmakers that “enough is enough.”
Advocates said they want bold action from lawmakers to end immigration detention, address climate change, economic inequality and more.
“We are making it clear that we won’t stand by while our communities and futures are sacrificed for profits,” said Vittoria Judy, the program coordinator for climate organization Youth United for Climate Crisis Action. “Today it isn’t just a march or rally, it’s a warning about the cost of inaction; it’s an invitation to meet this moment with the bold action that it actually demands, and it’s a commitment to defend each other, to show up for each other, care for each other.”

Advocates across a series of causes marched together from the Santa Fe Plaza culminating in a “We Got Us” rally outside the Roundhouse’s eastern doors on the opening day of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s final regular session. Organizers said more than 1,500 showed up for the event.
“We’re out here to unite with everybody, the strength comes from our togetherness and our unity,” said Deborah Jiron (Isleta Pueblo) with American Indian Movement Albuquerque.
Signs included calls for the impeachment of the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and some attendees wore shirts with the portrait of Renee Good, the 37-year old woman shot in Minneapolis by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official earlier this month.
Mekia Cozart, of Peñasco, said she joined the protest to stand up for her Hispanic immigrant family saying she wants New Mexico lawmakers to get “ICE out, period.”
She said her paternal grandfather was deported several years ago, and she is “terrified” of potential harassment for her friends and family by immigration officials.
“I’m constantly scared for them, and I just want this to stop,” Cozart told Source NM. “I’m 18 and I’m cleaning up adult’s messes, and that’s not my job. The world is ours, but we have no say in it, it seems like.”
Speakers called for support of legislation banning immigrant detention in the state.
“In the next few weeks, New Mexico has a choice to stand up to the violence and kidnapping of our people and pass the Immigrant Safety Act,” said Fernanda Banda, a co-director of the New Mexico Dream Team.

A comparable bill introduced in 2025 passed the House, but died without a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee. But even if the Legislature passes the bill and the governor signs it into law, two of the state’s three immigrant detention facilities operated by a private prison contractor could potentially still be able to remain open in New Mexico.
Judy, in an interview with Source NM, said that some of the organizations participating in the protest would be hosting virtual meetings every Monday to continue the momentum from the rally, to track legislation and get people involved.
“When we are looking at the small little watered-down bills that are coming out, we say that’s not going to do anything, and we need to push harder,” Judy said.

Northfield started the year with some key interim hires and signed an agreement with Montpelier for police coverage in the small Washington County town of about 5,900.
Steven Mackenzie, an engineer and former city manager in Barre, came out of retirement this month to serve as the interim town manager on a part-time basis. 
Introduced at a Jan. 13 selectboard meeting, Mackenzie said he learned about the vacancy from the Vermont League of Cities and Towns and decided to apply.

“Long story short, I thought that I could provide a service to the town,” he said at the meeting. 
Although public service “can be challenging at times,” Mackenzie said he enjoyed it.
“I feel very comfortable dealing with the public. I can’t solve everybody’s problems but I guarantee you that I basically have an open door policy,” he said.
Jeff Schulz, former longtime town manager, was set to retire in March but was removed from the position in December while he was on leave. Details of the severance agreement signed by the selectboard on Dec. 17 have not been released.
Selectboard Chair Charlie Morse called him “a welcome asset” at a meeting earlier this month and selectboard member Lydia Petty called for residents to support him.
Mackenzie did not immediately respond to a request for comment and his salary information was not available Tuesday.
One of his first tasks is to find a replacement for Laurie Baroffio, the town’s former financial director who resigned last year but is working part-time as a consultant until the position is filled. 
Baroffio is helping the selectboard draft the fiscal year 2026-27 municipal budget that will be presented to voters for approval on Town Meeting Day on March 3.
The town has also contracted with Kevin Moulton, the deputy police chief in Montpelier, as the interim police chief, effective Jan. 14, for an hourly rate of $73.54 plus expenses, according to the agreement. He will remain a Montpelier employee, will use a Montpelier police car and wear the city police uniform.
“He is a respected leader with extensive experience, and his role will help ensure continuity, stability, and professional oversight during this transition period,” Eric Nordenson, the police chief in Montpelier, wrote in an email Tuesday.
The four-month intermunicipal police agreement signed on Jan. 14 runs until May 1 but “can be extended by mutual consent to allow for a smooth transition to a full-time appointed Chief of Police” in Northfield.
During this time, Montpelier, Berlin and the Washington County Sheriff’s Department will assist with policing needs in town on a contract basis, “to ensure continuity of operations and adequate coverage,” according to the letter and agreement shared by Nordenson.
The Montpelier Police Department “fully supports the intermunicipal police agreement” with Northfield, Nordenson said in an email. “This partnership reflects a shared commitment to regional collaboration, efficient use of resources, and maintaining high-quality public safety services for our communities.”
Moulton’s appointment comes after former Police Chief Pierre Gomez resigned in October. One of three police chiefs of color in Vermont, Gomez reported facing racial harassment since he moved to town two years ago.
Mackenzie announced the new police contract on the town website on Monday.
“In addition to providing leadership to the existing department staff and responding to calls for service in a timely and effective manner, Chief Moulton, working with Montpelier Chief Nordenson, will collaborate with the Vermont State Police and other central Vermont police departments to provide full-time police coverage,” the post reads.
The selectboard may discuss “legal/personnel/contracts” in executive session at a special meeting scheduled Tuesday night, according to the posted agenda. 
Another special meeting scheduled for Wednesday may discuss the town manager search, possibly in executive session.

St. Bernards Medical Center launched the Maternal Life360 HOME program in Jonesboro in November 2024, allowing pregnant and postpartum Arkansans in Craighead County to receive at-home visits during and after high-risk pregnancies. The health system brought the program to Greene County in December, and it started accepting patients in Lawrence County on Tuesday, according to a St. Bernards news release.
Emily McGee, St. Bernards vice president for Nursing and Women’s and Children’s Services, said last month that the health system planned “to continue to grow by serving additional counties in the near future.”
“Ultimately, our vision is to have a program wherever we have a pregnancy or women’s health clinic,” McGee said in Tuesday’s news release.
In November 2022, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved a request from the Arkansas Department of Human Services to allow an additional 5,000 pregnant and postpartum Arkansans to receive Life360 HOME services.
Life360 started as part of Arkansas Health and Opportunity for Me, the state’s version of Medicaid expansion. Initially, only Medicaid expansion enrollees were eligible to participate in Life360 HOME, but the program now includes any Arkansan on Medicaid with a high-risk pregnancy living in a Life360 service area.
Arkansans must not be currently receiving other state or federally funded home-visiting services to be eligible for the Life360 HOME program.

Arkansas has the nation’s fourth-highest rate of maternal mortality, with 38 maternal deaths per 1,000 live births between 2018 and 2022, according to the independent health research center KFF. Arkansas also had the nation’s third-highest infant mortality rate in 2022, with nearly eight infant deaths per 1,000 live births, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. St. Bernards noted these statistics in Tuesday’s news release and said expanding Life360 HOME into Lawrence County is “a direct effort to address” these issues.
Arkansas remains the only state that has taken no action to adopt the federal option of extending postpartum Medicaid coverage from 60 days to 12 months after birth, according to KFF.
Legislation that would have expanded postpartum Medicaid coverage to 12 months did not pass the Legislature in 2023 or 2025. State Medicaid officials Janet Mann and Elizabeth Pitman told lawmakers last year that the Department of Human Services opposed the effort due to its cost.
Pitman called Life360 HOME “a cornerstone of our strategy to improve maternal health outcomes throughout the state” in Tuesday’s announcement.
“By addressing health and social needs together, these programs can save the lives of pregnant women and their infants,” Pitman said.
DHS funds Life360 HOME services in Little Rock, North Little Rock and Batesville and is working on launching the program in Hot Springs and Rogers, department officials said last month.
The program in Jonesboro has served roughly 60 families so far, McGee said in the news release.

(Photo via Google Earth)A Senate subcommittee advanced a measure Tuesday to remove the state requirement to maintain a State Historical Society of Iowa research center in Iowa City — a point of litigation as the state has already moved to close the facility.
Senate Study Bill 3033 strikes the state requirement for the Iowa Department of Administrative Services to maintain a historical resource research center in Iowa City. It would specify that the facility must be maintained in Des Moines.
The change was proposed months after the announced closure of the Iowa City center. Beginning June 30, 2026, the State Historical Society of Iowa (SHSI) Research Center is set to close, with changes in operations and hours beginning July 9. This change was announced by the State Historical Society of Iowa in June 2025 and sparked a lawsuit from a group of historians, donors and professors.

However, the location closed to the public earlier than expected — beginning Jan. 1 this year — after the state reached an agreement with the University of Iowa that keeps some records accessible through the university library, in response to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit, filed in Johnson County District Court in September, argues the move to close the Iowa City library and archives violated state law. The language cited in the lawsuit is what legislators are proposing to remove in the bill discussed at the Tuesday subcommittee meeting.
There is a second lawsuit filed by the nonprofit corporation State Historical Society Inc., which Jim Carney with the organization said is currently going through the administrative law process.  As these lawsuits proceed, he urged lawmakers to continue requiring DAS maintain the Iowa City location, saying many Iowans are “very concerned about capacity to merge everything” into Des Moines, both in terms of staffing and facility capabilities.
Public officials have said closing the Iowa City facility and moving materials to Des Moines is needed as the SHSI faces a $800,000 budget shortfall. But donors, historians and other advocates say the State Historical Building in Des Moines will not be able to properly maintain the Iowa City resources, as it “lacks sufficient climate-controlled space to house the Iowa City collections” alongside $72 million in deferred maintenance projects.
Additionally, more than half of the Iowa City historical collection is not expected to make the move to Des Moines. Iowa State Archivist Tony Jahn said at a June board meeting that 40% of the Iowa City collections will be transferred to the State Historical Building while the other 60% will be sold, dispersed or discarded.
Carney, as well as several other speakers, said a major concern coming out of the DAS-announced closure and moving of historical materials was a lack of “transparency” on what is happening with documents and other items.
“We don’t have an inventory of what was taken, nor do we have any understanding of how those materials — which are very valuable, irreplaceable — are being preserved and taken care of,” Carney said.
Several people opposing the bill criticized DAS for not sharing enough information on what was happening to the materials formerly housed at the Iowa City SHSI Research Center, but Nathan Reckman, DAS deputy director, said there are answers to the concerns brought up. He said the department’s decision to close the Iowa City facility was made because “we can’t support with our budget a center in Iowa City and a center here in Des Moines.”
He said there is a DAS website that details the items that have been moved from Iowa City to Des Moines, and that the department is committed to going through the required processes for any removal of access to the current collection. He also said the move will make Iowa historical materials more accessible to the wider public, as the cataloging system used at the Iowa City center does not make the items accessible online.
“The plan is to bring all the items in Iowa City that we can to Des Moines, and catalog them, make them available online, make them more accessible,” Reckman said. “… Our plan is to get these items more accessible and available to everyone.”
Sen. Carrie Koelker, R-Dyersville, who led the subcommittee meeting, said there have been “inaccurate” reports of the state destroying historical materials. She also said groups that donate historical materials to the State Historical Society of Iowa, including labor and religious organizations, were not paying rental or storage fees for the maintenance of these facilities.
“I don’t think we’re short-falling history by any means … but things are updated in time too,” Koelker said. “And budget shortfalls — counties not contributing, and there’s no rental fees for everyone that’s storing information there — I don’t know that that’s due diligence, that that should fall on Iowa taxpayers.”
The legislation moved forward in a 2-1 vote, with Democratic Sen. Art Staed of Cedar Rapids opposing the bill’s advancement. In the Iowa House, a bipartisan group of lawmakers — Reps. Adam Zabner, Bobby Kaufmann, Charley Thomson and Dave Jacoby — have introduced House File 2025, a separate proposal requiring DAS to maintain Iowa City and Des Moines facilities that are “adequately staffed” and “open to the public.”
Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner said she plans to introduce a companion bill to the House proposal in the Senate.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)FRANKFORT — Low pay and limited advancement opportunities are creating a “crisis” of turnover among Kentucky’s public defenders who are leaving for higher pay elsewhere, lawmakers were told Tuesday. 
Kentucky’s Public Advocate Damon Preston and Deputy Public Advocate Melanie Lowe told a legislative committee the significant turnover risks “constitutional failures” with Kentuckians not receiving adequate representation in court, creates instability in court proceedings, and can waste taxpayer funds by training staff attorneys who leave for work elsewhere.
“Kentucky really needs to raise the salary so that attorneys don’t have to look outside the borders of Kentucky in order to live a reasonable life,” Lowe told lawmakers. 
Ninety-four attorneys left the Department of Public Advocacy in 2025, accounting for a 24% turnover rate that year, according to a presentation by Preston and Lowe. The turnover rate has increased over several years from 17% in 2022. 
The department brought on a new class of public defenders consisting of 42 attorneys coming from law school in August 2025, though the department has lost 53 attorneys since that new class. Lowe said the median timespan of a departing attorney is 21 months, long enough for a new recruit to finish the department’s “excellent” training program and then leave. 
Preston and Lowe cite low pay as the major reason for the turnover. Their presentation states the starting salary for public defenders in Kentucky is $58,200, while the salary floor in other states with statewide public defender systems can be tens of thousands of dollars higher such as in Minnesota, which raised starting pay to $88,380. Their presentation stated that starting salaries are higher across the state border in cities including Cincinnati and Evansville. 
Public defenders in Kentucky have also switched sides in the courtroom, Preston and Lowe said, receiving raises to become prosecutors. Preston shared documents with the Lantern highlighting appropriations in the last two-year state budget for additional personnel for prosecutors and recruitment efforts by the Kentucky attorney general’s office. He said his department did not receive requested increased funding for additional attorneys and recruiting support during the last biennium. 
“They’re doing the same work. They’re in the same courtroom. They’re simply at that other table on the other side of the courtroom, and they’re making $20,000 or more,” Preston said. 
Preston and Lowe are asking state lawmakers for $10,581,857 in the upcoming two-year state budget to raise the salary floor of attorneys to $70,000 and raise other attorney positions within the department by a similar percentage. They’re also asking for funding to better recruit new attorneys and pay for private attorneys who are contracted to work for the department. 
“We definitely have had clients with serious charges who have gone through two and three and four attorneys,” Lowe said, as attorneys leave in the middle of court proceedings. “It’s very frustrating for the clients who are incarcerated and clients who are stuck in the system and really want to get a resolution to their case.” 
Department leaders are also advocating for changes in Kentucky law to narrow the scope of cases requiring public defenders, thereby freeing up the time and resources of those attorneys. 
They are proposing that public defenders no longer be part of cases involving Tim’s Law, in which law enforcement, family or friends can petition a court to have someone go through court-mandated mental health treatment. Preston said the person who is the subject of such a petition needs legal counsel. 
“Those cases sometimes can be pretty time-intensive,” Preston said. “That person needs counsel, but that could be met by a local attorney who’s paid on a per-case basis.” 
The department is also advocating for creating a “circuit advocate,” or public defenders that serve a specific judicial circuit that can encompass cases in more than one county.

Rep. Stephanie Dietz, R-Edgewood, the chair of the House Budget Review Subcommittee on Justice, Public Safety, & Judiciary, who heard Preston’s and Lowe’s testimony, plans to file a bill after collaborating with the department. She said the bill “shrinks the role” of the department over specific types of cases such as those involving Casey’s Law. That law allows friends, relatives or parents to petition a court to require someone go through substance abuse treatment, another situation where a person subject to a petition would need representation. 
“There’s some judges that have been appointing DPA to all Casey’s Law cases. They’re not equipped to handle all that,” Dietz said. 
As for the department’s request to raise the salary floor for public defenders, Dietz said she understands the situation but is not sure “where we’re going to land on that.” Dietz questioned how much it costs to train a new public defender who ultimately leaves after less than two years. 
“It doesn’t feel that that’s very cost-efficient either if you train them and you lose them. So what can we do to help them keep these attorneys there?” Dietz said. “I want to do everything I can to work with them and see them keep these young lawyers and keep them in Kentucky.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2783-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 17:56:50.038531

Supporters of the resolution argued that Washington has proven unwilling to address rising national debt; Opponents raised concerns about the uncertainty of a convention process that has never been used.
DOVER, Del. — A proposal urging Delaware to join a national effort to call a Convention of States under Article V of the U.S. Constitution failed Tuesday after a tense and closely divided vote in the Delaware Senate, underscoring sharp disagreements over federal power, fiscal restraint and the role of states in forcing constitutional change.
Senate Concurrent Resolution 114, sponsored by Sen. Bryant Richardson, R-Seaford, fell short on a split vote of 7 in favor, 7 opposed and 7 not voting. Under Senate rules, the evenly divided result meant the resolution failed.
The measure would have formally asked Congress to convene a convention limited to three subjects: imposing fiscal restraints on the federal government, limiting federal power and jurisdiction, and establishing term limits for members of Congress and other federal officials.
The vote followed a heated floor exchange between Sen. Dave Sokola, D-Newark, and Sen. Eric Buckson, R-Camden, that escalated enough to prompt Lt. Gov. Kyle Evans Gay, presiding over the chamber, to intervene and restore decorum.
Supporters of the resolution argued that Washington has proven unwilling to address rising national debt or restrain its own authority, leaving states with few remaining constitutional tools to force reform. They framed the Article V process as a lawful mechanism envisioned by the nation’s founders for moments when Congress fails to act.
Opponents raised concerns about the uncertainty of a convention process that has never been used, warning that once convened it could exceed its intended scope. Others expressed reluctance to commit Delaware to a national process they said lacks clear guardrails.
All seven votes in favor came from Republican senators, while all seven votes against came from Democrats. Seven additional Democrats abstained or did not vote, an unusually high number that signaled internal division within the caucus.
Despite the defeat, supporters indicated the effort is not over. Similar resolutions have been introduced in prior sessions, and advocates of the Convention of States movement continue to press lawmakers nationwide. Nineteen states have already passed comparable resolutions, with 34 required to trigger a convention.
The convention vote capped a busy opening day for the General Assembly.
Earlier, the House unanimously passed Senate Bill 106, requiring every Delaware school district and charter school to adopt clear policies limiting student cellphone use during the school day. Because the bill was amended in the House, it now returns to the Senate for concurrence.
The Senate session opened on a somber note, with lawmakers honoring fallen State Trooper Matthew “Ty” Snook. Later in the day, senators approved measures recognizing law enforcement service, firearm permit issues and employee compensation, and both chambers passed a bipartisan resolution calling for greater civility and respectful discourse in the General Assembly.
While SCR 114 failed, the close vote and intensity of the debate highlighted a broader national argument now playing out in Dover: whether structural change to the federal government should come from within Congress, or be driven by states using constitutional authority that has never before been tested.

Passed during the 2025 Legislative session, House Joint Resolution 61 requires a study of property insurance during the interim, and it was the highest ranked — or most important — study bill passed last session.
The legislature’s Economic Affairs Interim committee, helmed by House Speaker Rep. Brandon Ler, has picked up the study. And on Tuesday, they heard from a panel that included insurance lobbyists, consumer advocates and research organizations including Headwaters Economics.
Insurance lobbyists said extreme weather, “legal system abuse,” a rise in building costs and regulatory overreach are all problems. 
Insurance companies said they’re also paying out more than what they bring in and there’s concern about driving away providers.
Ler brought up cost shifting, a term also brought up repeatedly in the property tax discussions that dominated the final weeks of the last legislative session.
“If it gets cheaper for one party, it’s probably going to get more expensive for another and so, you know, the full solution is not just to pick a select group of insured and do something to make their policies cheaper,” Ler told the committee. “We’ve got a much bigger problem than that, and absolutely agree with that. Another thing, it’s already been stated that there is, you know, fewer and fewer insurance companies actually coming into the marketplace. We do not want to drive any of these last remaining insurance companies out.”
Consumer advocates, meanwhile, have expressed concern with the lack of data around rises in rates, nonrenewals of insurance policies and higher costs associated with lower credit scores.
“We need more data, and we need more accurate data, and it’s not just an issue in Montana, but across the country,” said Michael DeLong, who represented the Consumer Federation on the panel. “We’ve heard, there are a lot of anecdotes and stories, you’ve probably heard from people about rising insurance premiums, companies refusing to renew their policies, people cutting back and trying to hollow out policies, stronger, more frequent natural disasters, but there’s a lack of like, concrete information on what, exactly how bad the problem is, how much prices are going up.”
According to the Consumer Federation of America, average insurance premiums for a typical homeowner in Montana increased by about 10% from 2021 to 2024. Nationwide, the typical homeowner saw their property insurance premium increase by nearly $650 in that time period.
There has been one recent, major federal study into the issue, consolidated into a report that looked at rises in insurance rates between 2018-2022, using data obtained from the states. Some states, including Montana, did not submit data to this report.
DeLong went on to say there was a brief skirmish between the Treasury Department and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, though the NAIC — which is made up of the elected and appointed insurance commissioners across the country — eventually came on board.
The state is also planning to participate in the next NAIC data call, but data from that likely won’t be usable until June, said Trevor Graff, the director of government relations with the Securities and Insurance office.
“I’m hoping we can focus on the fact that we are participating in the data call, and we will mitigate the prior administration’s non-participation in that action,” Graff said.
Wildfires are also a continual concern and according to the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, the number of billion-dollar disasters is expected to increase by about 50% by the end of the decade. Montana has been impacted by at least one billion-dollar disaster annually.
“By the end of this decade, it is likely Montana will have experienced 16 or more billion-dollar disasters in just 10 years,” a presentation during Tuesday’s committee meeting stated.
Fires and what to do about them have been a long-running discussion and late last year one of the panelists, Kimi Barrett, a lead wildfire research and policy analyst at Headwaters Economics, helped author a report on the issue.
“If the homes are part of this problem, they must fundamentally be part of the solution, and in the most simplest form, by reducing risk proactively, before the wildfire becomes the disaster is our best chance at long term insurance retainment,” Barrett said Tuesday.
Ler, who spent time working fires with the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation and then more than a decade as a volunteer firefighter, said it’s a concern – and will take federal fire mitigation action. Exactly what type of (and how much) mitigation is needed is a point of contention among some environmentalists, with some researchers saying the forests are not as overgrown as many think.
Even so, there has been a push to do more mitigation work, which can be expensive.
“For us to see real reduction and real risk reduction in the state of Montana, we have to charge the federal government with actually taking care of the lands that they, in a sense, own or have control over, because without that, we’re never going to see a real reduction,” Ler said. “We can have all the mitigation plans in place on your private property, but when you have a fire coming down at you at 60 mph, there’s absolutely nothing you can do, and the houses are going to burn just the same.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1410759881-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 17:56:50.038531

Ruben Torres, advocacy and policy manager for the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition, said the hotline has received increased calls in recent days, from roughly one per day to now one to three calls per minute. 
“The calls are a mix of people having questions about safety and what’s going on, people needing to be connected to resources, a big number of bad faith callers and the potential sightings,” Torres told Maine Morning Star. 
These sightings come after the mayors of Portland and Lewiston announced last week that they were expecting an increase in federal immigration enforcement in their communities. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not confirmed nor denied a forthcoming escalation in Maine and did not respond to requests for comment on the recent sightings.  
Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline said Tuesday there was an “increased presence” of ICE agents but did not respond to questions about how he made his determination. It’s unclear at this time whether recent sightings amount to an uptick. Immigration arrests have been occurring across Maine, with an acceleration beginning in June as President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda got underway. 
The hotline, organized by MIRC and the People’s Coalition for Safety, is built for the purpose of identifying federal activity — with more than 300 people trained as verifiers. Organizers are now working to gather details about people who have been detained. They’ve also raised alarm about AI-generated images and the importance of thoroughly investigating each tip before sharing it publicly. 
Portland, Lewiston prep for potential uptick in federal immigration operations

As this work ramps up, communities are taking precautions. Immigrants are staying home. More school absences are being reported. 
Shortly after 9 a.m. Tuesday, Deering High School and Lincoln Middle School in Portland were in a brief lock out, meaning external doors were closed to people entering or leaving, because of potential immigration enforcement activity on Brighton Avenue, district communications coordinator Tess Nacelewicz said. 
Chief of the Penobscot Nation Kirk Francis told tribal citizens to carry their identification when traveling, especially near border regions or transportation hubs. Francis had encouraged this at the start of Trump’s second term, too. Citizens of other tribes have been picked up by ICE elsewhere in the country.
Undercover license plates
The Trump administration has begun relying on unmarked vehicles in immigration enforcement, raising concern about people being able to keep track of those taken by authorities and file legal actions without knowing the agency involved. 
After receiving a request last week from U.S. Customs and Border patrol for undercover license plates, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows paused the issuance of such plates. 
State law permits the use of unmarked vehicles for law enforcement when authorized by the secretary of state. The law also makes it so records for all unmarked vehicle registrations are confidential, therefore Bellows declined to share how many plates were requested. This is the first time Bellows, a Democrat, has paused these plates for federal authorities during her tenure. 
Federal agencies can still request general government plates — which in their case would read “U.S. government.” Those plates are generally identifiable as government vehicles, and in the public registration database, they link back to the place of business for that agency. 
DHS and ICE declined to say how many undercover plates they requested in Maine. 
“DHS is not going to confirm our vehicles and put an even larger target on our officers’ backs,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs like Tren de Aragua and MS-13, criminal rings, murderers, and rapists.”

There have been numerous instances captured on video showing agents in plain clothes not immediately identifying themselves, while arresting people who have no gang association nor criminal history. As of the latest data from November, about 73% of people held in ICE detention have no criminal conviction. And, many of those convicted committed only minor offenses, such as traffic violations.
There have also been cases where federal immigration agents detained U.S. citizens. On Sunday in Minnesota, for example, a U.S. citizen said agents raided his home at gunpoint without a warrant, forcing him outside wearing only shorts in below freezing conditions before detaining him and returning him home later that day without explanation. Earlier this week, the Trump administration announced that they aim to strip more foreign-born Americans of their citizenship. 
McLaughlin claimed their officers are facing a “1300% increase in assaults and 3,200% increase in vehicle attacks against them including domestic terrorists following our officers and ramming them with vehicles.” 
DHS didn’t provide evidence to support those figures, or for similar claims it has made in the past. The number of assaults on ICE agents have increased, but there is no public evidence that the spike is as dramatic as the federal government has claimed.
“There are legitimate reasons for unmarked plates. Law enforcement in Maine use them routinely for undercover, confidential operations,” Bellows said. “Given what’s happening in Minnesota, and what had taken place in Illinois, we paused issuance of those plates until we can get some assurances that Maine plates won’t be used for lawless purposes.” 
In Minnesota, observers have reported ICE and DHS agents switching out and removing license plates on the vehicles they’re using for immigration operations, which is generally against state law. The state has since sued ICE and DHS over that practice, among others. 
Illinois and the city of Chicago also sued federal authorities over this practice, after the state launched a plate watch hotline to give residents a way to report suspected license plate tampering. 
When asked what type of assurance would satisfy lifting the pause in Maine, Bellows said her department would need more information from the federal agencies about why they are needed and what they’d be used for.

Bellows, who is currently running for governor, said on Monday she was doxxed for her decision. She said she received more than two dozen threatening phone calls after her cell phone and home address were posted online. 
Emphasis on nonviolence comes from all corners 
Since local officials announced the suspected uptick in immigration operations, Mainers have peacefully gathered to protest around the state. But, the district’s chief federal prosecutor is still calling for protestors to heed to his warning about violence. At the same time, a so-called militia group with a rallying cry to stop “left-wing violence” is trying to build its ranks.
In Portland, hundreds denounced ICE during a protest on Sunday in Monument Square. In Wells, about 130 people stood out near Route 1 demanding the federal agency leave Maine, an action that corresponded with Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
Local organizers have long been preparing for ICE to arrive, emphasizing that their efforts to verify activity and provide mutual aid are rooted in non-violence and focused on de-escalation tactics. 
“I think there’s a narrative right now that there’s a desire to agitate, but our work really is rooted in non-violence and showing up for community and keeping loving and steady and calming presence,” said Crystal Cron, executive director of Presente! Maine. 
Despite that, on Sunday a group called the “Pine Guard” announced it would be forming to counteract “far-left socialist” ICE critics, including by sending people undercover to anti-ICE actions.
“It is not the role of the Pine Guard to physically confront the far-left Socialists, but instead to expose them,” the group wrote on social media. 
Meanwhile, U.S. Attorney Andrew Benson warned Maine protestors on Monday not to interfere with federal immigration enforcement.
Benson, who was nominated by Trump in September and formerly served as a Maine District Court Judge and homicide prosecutor, wrote, “Anyone who forcibly assaults or impedes a federal law enforcement officer, willfully destroys government property, or unlawfully obstructs federal law enforcement activity commits a federal crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat who is also running for U.S. Senate, has also called for protests to be peaceful — “to meet any hostility with reserve and resolve.”  
Without pointing to specifics, the Maine Law Enforcement Coalition issued a statement Saturday in response to what the group categorized “inﬂammatory political rhetoric and misleading public narratives.”
“Recent portrayals suggesting sudden or extraordinary activity are inaccurate and contribute to unnecessary alarm,” the coalition wrote about federal law enforcement actions. “Political spin and sensational media coverage distract from facts and place officers and community members at greater risk.” 
Increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters by federal agents have been documented under the Trump administration: smashing in car windows, shoving people to the ground, and spraying chemical agents. In some cases, immigration agents are using banned chokeholds that cut off breathing.
On Friday, a federal judge gave a significant victory to Minnesota protesters, granting a preliminary injunction preventing federal officers from retaliating against demonstrators.

(Getty Images)A nursing home owner pardoned by President Donald Trump has been released from an Arkansas prison days after a state board pardoned him.
Joseph Schwartz, who had been serving a state sentence on tax evasion and Medicaid fraud charges, was released on Tuesday morning. 
Schwartz had been ordered last month to prison to serve out his sentence on state Medicaid fraud and tax evasion charges. The Arkansas Post Prison Transfer Board last week granted him parole.
Schwartz, of New York, was three months into a three-year federal sentence for tax fraud when Trump pardoned him in November. 
Schwartz pleaded guilty in 2024 in federal court for his role in a $38 million tax fraud scheme involving nursing homes he owned across the country.
Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin filed a petition last month seeking that Schwartz serve out the rest of his state sentence.
“Joseph Schwartz returned to Arkansas on December 29 to serve the remainder of time he owed the state per his plea agreements, and he followed state procedures in seeking parole, which was granted by the Arkansas Post Prison Transfer Board,” Jeff LeMaster, a spokesperson for Griffin’s office, said in a statement. “While he has been released, he will still be required to pay the restitution he owes as part of his plea agreements, and we will continue working to ensure he does.” 
Schwartz had also been ordered to pay the state in restitution and fees. Kevin Marino, an attorney for Schwartz, said Schwartz has been making regular payments and has paid $400,000 toward that amount and the attorney general’s office said he still owes about $1.4 million.
Schwartz, who is also a rabbi, provided spiritual counseling to some inmates during his brief time in Arkansas prison and had received letters from them thanking him, Marino said.
“If there was some good that came from this, that’s what it was: that was that Rabbi Schwartz was able to be of service and assistance to those in need,” Marino said.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Judge-with-gavel-1024x758.jpg,,,2026-01-20 17:56:50.038531

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A bill requiring teachers to take an oath to the Florida and U.S. constitutions, and to non-partisanship, was temporarily postponed in advance of its first committee hearing Tuesday.
Teachers would have to take constitutional oath under newly proposed bill

SB 430, sponsored by Jacksonville Republican Sen. Clay Yarborough requiring Florida College System and State University System instructors and K-12 school personnel to swear the oath, has an uncertain fate.
Yarborough told the Florida Phoenix after the Education Pre-K-12 meeting that he lacked the votes to pass the bill through the committee.
The panel comprises five Republicans, including Yarborough, and three Democrats. All senators were present.
The bill is similar to Rep. Tom Fabricio’s bill, HB 147, but goes further by requiring the oath for higher education instructors whereas Fabricio’s is limited to K-12.
Chapter 876 of Florida Statutes already requires state employees, including those serving on school boards and working for the state and county school districts and institutions of higher education, to swear that they are citizens of Florida and will support the U.S. and Florida constitutions.
Other states require oaths to federal and state constitutions, including California, Georgia, and New York. According to Encyclopedia.com, almost two-thirds of states since 1863 have adopted teacher loyalty oaths.
The House version of the bill is in the Student Academic Success Subcommittee, but not on the panel’s next meeting agenda.
This is the second week of the Legislature’s 60-day session.



The proposed oath:
“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support, protect, and defend the Constitution and Government of the United States and the Constitution and Government of the State of Florida; that I am duly qualified for employment as a member of the school personnel in this state; that I will well and faithfully perform the duties of a member of the school in a professional, independent, objective, and nonpartisan manner; that I will uphold the highest standards of academic integrity, and professional ethics; that I will foster a respectful learning environment for all students which promotes critical thinking, civic responsibility, and lifelong learning; and that I will serve as a positive role model in both conduct and character, so help me God.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7919-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 17:56:50.038531

The brunt of the storm is expected to hit Friday and continue through the weekend, according to the National Weather Service. Some will see low temperatures in the single digits. 
As of Tuesday afternoon, the National Weather Service was predicting over 6 inches of snow in central parts of the state, and a glaze of ice south of Interstate 40.
OG&E has both coal and natural gas fuel in storage for the upcoming cold snap, the company said Tuesday.
“Exreme cold can result in higher demand for electricity,” the company said. “All available units at OG&E’s power plants will be in operation during the event and ready to support the grid. The Southwest Power Pool will dispatch power generation as needed to meet electricity demand.”
PSO has winterized critical assets, upgraded equipment and strengthened fuel supply for power plants since Winter Storm Uri, the company said.
The company said its generating operating reserve margins, which are set by the Southwest Power Pool, have increased since 2021 to ensure reliable service. The Southwest Power Pool manages the electric grid for states across the central United States.
“These ongoing efforts reflect PSO’s commitment to maintaining a resilient system and keeping customers safe, supported, and connected during Oklahoma’s toughest winter weather.”
In February 2021, Winter Storm Uri caused power outages, infrastructure problems and created an unusually high demand for natural gas.
Public utilities reported that natural gas prices jumped nearly 40,000%, which left Oklahoma consumers with over $4.5 billion in unexpected energy costs.
In an effort to mitigate the financial impact on consumers, OG&E, PSO and Oklahoma Natural Gas, received permission from the Corporation Commission to pass the costs onto consumers through a monthly surcharge that is expected to last nearly 30 years.
Consumers would have had to pay much more immediately to cover the cost without the securitization process.
Carson Cunningham, Oklahoma Natural Gas public relations manager, said Tuesday that the company prepares year-round for winter weather.
“As cooler temperatures move into Oklahoma, ONG is prepared to deliver natural gas safely and reliably,” he said.
Utility companies are encouraging residents to have an emergency kit including flashlights, non-perishable food, water and first-aid supplies.
Residents are asked to stay away from downed power lines and ensure smoke, carbon monoxide and methane detectors are installed and working properly. 
Meanwhile, the Oklahoma Department of Transportation will start putting down brine in some locations Tuesday night, said Emily Long, a spokesperson.
“Brine is used for pre-treating roadways just before a storm when conditions permit to assist in melting the ice from underneath,” Long said. “Once the storm hits, we use a salt and sand mixture. However, these are less effective when temps fall below 15 degrees. Our crews will switch to using 100% sand applications.”
The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority will be pre-treating all turnpike bridges and elevated surfaces between Tuesday night and Thursday afternoon, said Lisa Shearer-Salim, a spokesperson.
“Crews are closely watching forecasts for their areas across the state and will be ready to deploy with salt and sand trucks well in advance of significant precipitation,” she said.
Motorists are encouraged to prepare their vehicles ahead of travel in inclement weather, she said.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)The Trump administration has sued another state — Virginia — in its quest to obtain sensitive voter data, despite two recent legal setbacks in suits against other states.
The Justice Department on Friday sued Susan Beals, the elections commissioner in Virginia, after months of seeking a copy of the state’s voter registration lists, including individual names, addresses, dates of birth and Social Security numbers.
“Virginia becomes the next state sued for ignoring federal law!” U.S. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon wrote on the social media platform X.
The Trump administration has sued more than 20 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, in what the administration frames as a quest to ensure that states are properly maintaining voter rolls, that ineligible people are kept off rolls and that only citizens are voting.
Federal courts deny Trump request for private voter data in 2 states

The U.S. Department of Justice is sharing state voter roll information with the Department of Homeland Security in a search for noncitizens, the Trump administration confirmed in September.
While election officials stress that well-maintained voter rolls are important, President Donald Trump and some of his Republican allies have long promoted baseless claims of widespread voter fraud.
In the Virginia case, the Justice Department claims it was reassured by the administration of former Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin that it would hand over voter rolls. But that did not occur and Youngkin was term-limited. On Saturday, Democrat Abigail Spanberger was sworn in as Virginia’s 75th governor.
Beals, the elections commissioner, was appointed by Youngkin in 2022. The state election department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last week, similar federal lawsuits hit roadblocks in California and Oregon.
U.S. District Court Judge David Carter dismissed a lawsuit by the Department of Justice against California seeking voter information, calling the request “unprecedented and illegal.” Just a day earlier, a separate federal judge said from the bench he planned to dismiss a similar lawsuit against Oregon.
Democratic secretaries of state have criticized the federal government’s data requests, calling them an unwarranted attempt by the Trump administration to exercise federal power over elections. Under the U.S. Constitution, states administer elections, though Congress can regulate them.

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)A committee of state Senate Democrats on Tuesday discussed a proposal to require Pennsylvania employers to provide 24 hours of paid leave for “small necessities” each year. The goal is to ensure employees who take care of family members like children or elderly parents are able to attend medical appointments, school activities, or respond to unexpected emergencies.
“This is legislation that gets at the key question: ‘What is work life balance?’” Sen. Art Haywood (D-Montgomery), the bill’s sponsor, said. “Employees are not just workers. They are also family members.”
The bill is based on a law that passed in Massachusetts, though it does not go as far as family leave policies implemented in states including New Jersey and California, according to panelists who testified on Tuesday. 
The proposal has yet to be introduced and exact language has not been released publicly, but a memo seeking co-sponsors was issued last December.
Lonnie Golden, a professor of economics and labor-human resources at Penn State and one of the panelists, said it will benefit both workers and bosses.
“There’s some evidence that it improves workers’ job satisfaction, so as a result of that [employers] are more likely to retain senior, experienced staff,” Golden said. 
However, Golden noted that there can be downsides for employers, especially when one member of a small team needs time off.

Blake Emmanuel, the director of advocacy and policy at the Fund for Women and Girls, said the policy could be especially beneficial for women in the workforce, who are more likely to be primary caretakers for their families as well.
“From a women’s issue perspective, we know that women fulfill the majority of caretaking roles,” Emmanuel said. “Data supplied by the U.S. Department of Labor found that women need to take more leave for family or medical reasons — 24% — versus men, who need to take 17%, and they still have even more unmet needs.”
Emmanuel, who is a mother of children with disabilities, said such a policy would have benefitted her greatly when her children were in school, and she often attended multiple meetings there each month.
Wallace Weaver, a spokesperson for Haywood, said the bill’s language is still being fine tuned, which includes answering questions such as which employers will be required to provide leave and exactly what circumstances will qualify as “small necessities.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_6093-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-20 17:56:50.038531

Senate File 2033 would, if passed, require the Iowa Board of Regents to establish rules stating universities must require three-credit-hour, general education courses in American history and government for graduation, and provide credits for students transferring with similar courses already under their belt.
The board of regents would also need to review all general education requirements and core curricula for a report due to the General Assembly by the end of 2026.
The bill advanced from a three-member Senate Education subcommittee Tuesday.

The Center for Intellectual Freedom at the University of Iowa, Center for Cyclone Civics at Iowa State University and Center for Civic Education at the University of Northern Iowa would be required to create courses satisfying the new general education requirements, as well as establish ongoing lecture and debate series. They would also have to submit annual reports of their achievements and the opportunities, challenges and obstacles they’ve faced to the board of regents, General Assembly and governor.
Iowa Board of Regents State Relations Officer Jason Chapman, echoing comments he made during the subcommittee on the legislation’s House companion bill, House Study Bill 543, said the board is registered undecided on the bill but has concerns about transfer credits and how they’ll work with high school, community college and international students.
Connie Ryan, Interfaith Alliance of Iowa executive director and lobbyist for the organization’s action fund, also reiterated her concerns on the House bill, that it is an overreach of the Legislature that will negatively impact students as higher education costs continue to rise. She also said there should be allocations provided by the state to the centers of civic education if the Legislature expects them to develop and put on ongoing lecture and debate series.
Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, said no one questions the fact that American history and government are “clearly very important” topics, but requiring them as part of general education would be a huge lift for colleges, in terms of both finances and manpower.
“We don’t know how we’re going to pay for this, and we don’t know how we’re going to staff this,” Quirmbach said, “I think that there’s a real problem there.”
Looking at just ISU, where Quirmbach taught for nearly 30 years, he said the two courses would need to accommodate as many as 13,200 students every year. With large courses of 200 students, there would need to be 66 sections of the two courses, which would lead to the need to hire at least 17 new faculty members to teach them.
Factoring in their pay and benefits, and those of the teaching assistants who would work with them, Quirmbach said it would cost ISU more than $3 million to implement these courses. For all three universities, Quirmbach said the total cost would come in at around $6.6 million.
That’s assuming the faculty and teaching assistants needed to take on these new courses could be recruited to do the job, he said.
Quirmbach also raised questions about language in the bill prohibiting courses focused on the study of “subgroups of Americans or other nationalities,” he said, and the fact that this mandate would be at the college level and only for universities governed by the Iowa Board of Regents.
Subcommittee chair, and filer of the legislation, Sen. Kerry Gruenhagen, R-Walcott, did not answer a question by Quirmbach to define what a subgroup is, saying the discussion could be saved for the Senate floor or after the subcommittee meeting.
As males are a minority population in the U.S., Quirmbach said under the rules of this legislation, an American history course “that is primarily dominated by white males would not satisfy the requirement here.”
“It seems that in order to satisfy this requirement, you have to involve, God forbid, the word diversity,” Quirmbach said. “And if that’s your intent, that’s fine with me, but I think we need a definition of subgroups before we can really pass judgment on this proposition.”
Gruenhagen and Sen. Mike Pike, R-Des Moines, had no comment on the legislation, but Gruenhagen said he would be moving the bill to the full Senate Education Committee to consider.

Friday is “ICE Out of Minnesota: Day of Truth & Freedom” — a statewide pause of daily activity to “stand together against the actions of the federal government against the state of Minnesota,” according to the website.
Demonstrators will march and rally in downtown Minneapolis Friday starting at 2 p.m.
Citing the killing of Renee Good by federal agent Johnathan Ross, the “ICE Out” day organizers say the general strike is intended to be a day of nonviolent reflection.
“It is time to suspend the normal order of business to demand immediate cessation of ICE actions in MN, accountability for federal agents who have caused loss of life and abuse to Minnesota residents and call for Congress to immediately intervene,” the website states.
Dozens of businesses, restaurants and co-ops in the Twin Cities are planning to close Friday, according to Bring Me the News, which is keeping a running list.
The strike is endorsed by ISAIAH, the nonprofit coalition of Minnesota faith and community groups, and numerous unions including the local teachers unions of Minneapolis and St. Paul public schools.
Minneapolis Public Schools will have no school Friday for a teacher record-keeping day, according to the district. St. Paul Public Schools has not yet canceled school, but the St. Paul Federation of Educators is supporting “ICE Out” day.
The Minnesota Nurses Association, which represents over 22,000 nurses and other health care professionals, said it supports the general strike Friday, but it’s encouraging nurses to keep working since their union contract has “no-strike” provisions.
Service Employees International Union, which represents nearly 2 million workers across the country, said many of its members across the country will protest in solidarity with Minnesota. 
“When we look at Minneapolis — the violence, the cruelty that’s being brought by this federal government against working people — it is now more than ever that we have to stand together, regardless of our differences,” said David Huerta, president of SEIU-United Service Workers West and SEIU California, in a statement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MG_2597-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 17:56:50.038531

(Photo by Alex Baumhardt/Oregon Capital Chronicle)A sitting county controller and U.S. House candidate maintains that a federal agency hasn’t paid its rent to Lehigh County since 2022, despite occupying office space owned by the government body. 
Mark Pinsley, the Lehigh County controller, announced Tuesday that Homeland Security Investigations — which falls within the broader Immigration and Customs Enforcement framework at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — owes the county $115,426, not including late fees of $7,600.
“I don’t think as a county government we should be supporting anything like that,” said Pinsley. “We should deport ICE out of our building so that we’re not associated … We should be supporting our residents in every way that we can.” 
Following Pinsley’s findings, newly elected county executive Josh Siegel said he would move to “evict” federal agents, according to the Morning Call.

Pinsley’s held his position since 2020 and ran unsuccessfully for state auditor general in 2024. He’s now in a crowded Democratic primary to challenge first-term U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, a Republican aligned with President Donald Trump. The Lehigh Valley’s 7th District is a perennial toss-up and closely watched by politicos nationwide.
He spoke to the Capital-Star Tuesday ahead of the announcement, tying a recommendation to issue an eviction notice with a repudiation of the federal agency’s recent actions in Minnesota and beyond. 
The outsized presence of federal officials in Minneapolis has increased city tensions, prompting protests, mass arrests and networks of private citizens countering agency actions. A recent CBS News/YouGov poll found the majority believe ICE was being “too tough,” while 54% of those interviewed believed that immigration officer Jonathan Ross was “not justified” in the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7.
Neither Homeland Security nor ICE immediately responded to a request for comment Tuesday afternoon.
 Lehigh County isn’t among the agencies in the commonwealth that has a formal agreement to help ICE with immigration enforcement. The county’s policy is to cooperate with the agency “to the fullest extent legally possible.”
 What happened?

In late 2022, Homeland Security Investigations signaled an intent to lease the fourth floor of Allentown’s Hamilton Financial Center, a 10-story building owned by Lehigh County. First, the two government agencies would sign a Memorandum of Agreement for ten months, followed by a three-year lease from Oct. 1, 2023 to Sept. 31, 2026. 
The former would net the county $29,250 while the latter would bring in another $111,745, according to an agreement attached to a Board of Commissioners meeting agenda from November 2022. 
bill 2022-43
Commissioners didn’t spend more than five minutes discussing the agreement during its first reading on Nov. 9, 2022 or its final vote on Nov. 22, 2022. 
“I think this would be a great opportunity with the county and Homeland Security and give us the opportunity to welcome them into our county,” said sponsoring commissioner Zakiya Smalls at the latter meeting. 
But only the first document ever got the required signature from HSI, while the lease remained unsigned. 
“Normally, once a contract gets signed, it goes into our computer system and then we know to expect revenue,” said Pinsley. “In this case, that never happened because it was never signed.”
Pinsley reported that the federal government told him that Special Agent in Charge William S. Walker “lacked proper authority” to sign the memorandum. At the time, media described Walker as a deputy special agent for Homeland in Philadelphia who oversaw investigations into sex and drug trafficking. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to his LinkedIn, Walker was working as an acting assistant director when he left the agency in September 2025 to become a senior vice president at an anti-trafficking nonprofit.
Lehigh County’s Pinsley said that a tip to his office following a recent administration change at the county level brought the lack of payment to the forefront as the federal agency explores a new lease past the expiration of the original proposal — which he said could be signed with ICE, not HSI. 
“I don’t think we should be housing HSI at all. It’s being run by (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security) Kristi Noem, who I have no respect for,” Pinsley said. “I don’t care if they call it HSI or ICE. It doesn’t matter what the name is.”
Two of Pennsylvania’s 19 U.S. House members signed onto an effort to impeach Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, last week. Noem has repeatedly defended her agency’s actions, backtracking after initially claiming officers weren’t using chemical weapons like pepper spray against protesters. The effort would need Republican support, since the party holds the majority in both the House and Senate. 
 Next steps

Pinsley said he is “hopeful that we will be able to collect the money that is owed.”
“Ultimately, they did reside in our county and it was never meant to be free, and so they should have to pay,” said Pinsley. “I believe they should have to pay market rate, which is definitely above” the rate included under the unsigned lease.
Pinsley said he would also recommend that the county launch a database allowing locals to report alleged ICE misdeeds, such as the physical altercations or damage to personal property reported in Minneapolis.
He additionally called for “stability” in the nation’s immigration system that didn’t change from administration to administration, as well as a “path to citizenship” for “someone who’s been working here ten years and is paying taxes and is a good neighbor.”
“When (President Donald Trump) was talking about this, he was talking about violent felons. But we’re not going after violent felons — they’re going after grandma now,” said Pinsley. “And when they’re doing that, they’re causing a lot of fear. They’re tear gassing people; they’re using pepper balls; they’re putting on masks in American cities. I have no tolerance for that.”
According to December data analyzed by the New York Times, one-third of immigrants arrested by ICE have no history of criminal charges, compared to 7% with violent convictions.
In contrast, Mackenzie offered his support to ICE agents during a public appearance last week, telling the Lehigh Valley News that in the Good shooting, “When situations are in the heat of the moment, law enforcement has to take proper actions to keep themselves safe. That’s what this individual did.”
Democrats are targeting Mackenzie’s swing district seat in their effort to flip control of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Along with Pinsley, six other Democrats are running for a chance to challenge Mackenzie:

Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., will once again seek reelection to keep her seat in the U.S. Senate, according to campaign filings with the West Virginia Secretary of State’s office.
Capito filed her reelection paperwork with the office on Tuesday. So far, state Sen. Tom Willis, R-Berkeley, and Janet McNulty, a children’s author from Martinsburg, West Virginia, have also filed to run as Republicans and challenge Capito for her seat.
Capito was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2014. Before that, she held several terms in the U.S. House of Representatives — 2000 to 2015 — where she served the state’s 2nd congressional district.
The daughter of former West Virginia Gov. Arch Moore, Capito began her political career representing Kanawha County in the state House of Delegates for two terms, from 1996 to 2000.
Her election in 2014 was the first time in 56 years that a Republican was elected to represent West Virginia in the U.S. Senate. She is the first woman from any party to hold the position in the state.
Capito shared on social media this week that more than 50 members of the state House of Delegates have endorsed her bid for reelection. In the Senate — where her primary opponent Willis holds office — at least 14 current members have done the same.
Willis, an attorney and businessman by trade, has yet to complete his first term in the statehouse. A Hedgesville native, he describes himself as a “Christian Constitutional Conservative.” Last month, Senate President Randy Smith named Willis to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Willis was elected to the state Senate in November 2024 to represent the fifth district, which includes portions of Berkeley, Morgan and Hampshire counties. Ahead of the general election, Willis unseated longtime Republican Senate President Craig Blair in the 2024 primary. Blair had held his seat for 12 years.
To date, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, Capito has nearly $4 million on hand for her reelection campaign. Willis so far has raised a little more than $200,000. McNulty reports about $300, per the FEC. 
On the Democratic side, Zach Shrewsbury — who lost his previous senatorial bid after being defeated by former Wheeling Mayor Glenn Elliott in the 2024 Democratic primary — reports having nearly $150,000 on hand. Rio Phillips, a community organizer also running as a Democrat for the U.S. Senate, has nearly $7,000, per the FEC.

Sold for $56 million, Lincoln County’s Pawnee Springs Ranch on Tuesday became the latest investment for Mark and Robyn Jones of Westlake, Texas. The high school sweethearts with a growing family of six kids and 20 grandchildren said they were seeking to diversify their business ventures.
Among other key holdings is part ownership of Goosehead Insurance, a public company the Joneses founded and grew, and a sprawling forested timberland ranch the pair bought a few years ago in Montana. 
“What we wanted to do is have a sizable operation that focuses on actual agricultural production,” Mark Jones said in an interview days ago on his 64th birthday. “The Sandhills quickly jumped to the top of the list.”
 

Ranch features
Mark Johnson of Hall and Hall, which handles ag real estate in nine states, said Pawnee Springs Ranch “exemplifies the top qualities of a Nebraska Sandhills river ranch.” Among its features:

Nearly six miles of North Platte River frontage and nine center pivots covering about 1,700 irrigated acres.
Calf backgrounding lots with concrete bunks, an indoor/outdoor arena.
Balanced ecosystem with fertile river bottoms and native Sandhills rangeland providing habitat for deer, turkey and waterfowl.




Drawn by the property’s 2,500 mother cows, wildlife habitat, native range, river corridors and other ag benefits of the Ogallala Aquifer, Jones said the search led them to the Nebraska ranchland east of North Platte, whose name harkens to the area’s original Native American inhabitants.
 Famed ownership roots

Hall and Hall, an ag focused multi-state real estate company based in Valentine, represented both the buyer and seller in the private listing deal, with local agent Mark Johnson serving as listing broker. 
When Hall and Hall represented owners of the Nebraska Metzger ranch last year, the asking price for that 55,136-acre property was $50 million, an amount brokers described then as possible state record for a ranch sale. Johnson said the Metzger family ultimately decided to keep the Cherry County multigenerational ranch and work through the family dynamics. 
Publicly available documents show that the Gottsch Feeding Corp. sold Pawnee Springs Land and Cattle LLC Tuesday for $56 million.
“It’s the largest total dollar ranch sale we’ve been able to determine from any records we could find,” Johnson said. 
Among past owners of the Pawnee Springs property, which dates back to 1918, are names that ring familiar to Nebraska business and social circles. A former Nebraska governor, Keith Neville, was a previous owner. Construction titan Peter Kiewit bought the operation in 1949. He once told the North Platte Telegraph that the ranch derived its name from the natural springs that flowed.

The family behind Gottsch Feeding Corp. started leasing in 1985 and eventually purchased the ranch. In a statement regarding Tuesday’s sale, the Gottsches said “with a heavy heart” it agreed to sell a ranch that has been part of their family for 41 years.
“With three generations being a part of the spring brandings, summer grass and fall/winter backgroundings, Pawnee has shaped many lives,” the Gottsches said, offering special thanks to the Boeshart family caretakers and to neighbors who pitched in to help during branding season. “Those memories will always be cherished.”
The Gottsch statement said its family business footprint spans Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri and Texas, and its commitment stretches seven decades of “bridging the gap between ranching, high-tech feedlot management and sustainable farming.”
 ‘Long-term commitment’ 

Under the new ownership, Pawnee Springs for the most part will maintain current operations, said Ryan Langston, son-in-law to Jones and new CEO of the ranch. That includes raising calves from birth to weaning and returning them to grass as yearlings, as well as running ag pivots.

Three cowboys who now live and work on the ranch will stay, Langston said, and a new manager is to be hired to replace the current one who he said is moving on with the Gottsches.
“We are making a long-term commitment to the area,” Langston said. “We intend to hire local talent where possible, partner with our neighbors and make meaningful contributions to the local community.”
Known also for philanthropy, the Joneses in 2021 donated $101 million to the Montana State University nursing program — the home state of the scenic Flathead Ridge Ranch they bought that year. The couple told the university news service their intention was to help address one of the most defining challenges of the time: access to health care, particularly for residents of rural and remote areas.
The university at the time called it the largest ever donation to a college of nursing and the largest private gift in the state’s history.

Regarding the Nebraska purchase, Jones told the Examiner he and his wife hope it is the first of more acquisitions in the region. He said they were eager to invest in and build a “large-scale, truly world-class beef production operation … that in its most fundamental form is converting grass to protein.” 
He sees the family’s focus being in Nebraska, Kansas, Wyoming and Montana. The Pawnee Springs operation, he said, “will be a platform we can build onto.”
As a commercial enterprise, the Nebraska tract differs from the Jones’ 125,000-acre alpine ranch in Montana, which they refer to as a “family legacy investment.” Jones said he and his wife have tried to continue that property’s historical use by keeping the vast majority open to public recreation.
There, he said, “our objective is really to conserve the land. It’s been fairly heavily logged … So we’re very focused on nursing the forest back to optimal health.” 
 ‘Jones has lost his mind’ 

The Joneses are not planning to live in Nebraska, but hope to be “active participants” in the local community.
Said Jones: “You should expect us to have a very real and ongoing presence and engagement with the community.”

The couple’s fortune is built upon a relationship that started as teens in Alberta, Canada. Married young and with their first few kids, Jones said he enrolled in college in the mid-1980s. In 1989, the family moved to Boston so he could attend Harvard Business School.
“Robyn was pregnant at that time with our fifth daughter. I believe that we still hold the record for the greatest number of kids for any Harvard Business School student,” Jones said with a chuckle.
He worked several years at Bain global management consulting firm. Robyn went from stay-at-home mom to work that led her to establish the insurance company the couple continued to grow together, after her husband made a job switch.
“When I told my partners (at Bain) I was leaving, they all laughed,” Jones recalled. “They thought, ‘This Jones has lost his mind.’ But you know, we’re very comfortable with people laughing at us.”
The Joneses remain chair and vice chair of Goosehead, a large national insurance broker that connects people with various home, auto, flood and other insurance carriers. Forbes estimates the couple’s combined net worth at $2 billion, and included Robyn on a 2025 list of America’s richest “self-made” women entrepreneurs, noting a net worth for her of $1.2 billion.

An appealing part of the Nebraska ranch purchase, said Jones, whose early jobs included laying pipe and driving a truck, was the opportunity to have their grandkids work there. 
“We want our grandkids to learn and see the value of hard work,” he said.
He said his dealings with the sellers reflected an integrity he equates to the ranching operation.
“These are the kind of people we love to do business with,” he said.

Photographs by John Partipilo/ Tennessee LookoutA second-term Metro Councilmember announced on Tuesday she will run for Nashville mayor in 2027, challenging incumbent Freddie O’Connell. 
Joy Styles, who represents South Nashville’s District 32, said the city is suffering from a lack of leadership.  
“I’m here today to tell you that the needs of all Nashvillians are not being met,” said Styles. 
She made her announcement from Global Mall — the former Hickory Hollow Mall that was repurposed to include a community center and library — and said the O’Connell administration has failed to make sufficient investment in the facility, which sat vacant for years. 
Styles worked with the administration of prior Mayor John Cooper to begin redeveloping it.
“This mayor has made massive investments into (Nashville’s) East Bank, which I like to call the ‘invisible city,’ because no one lives there yet,” Styles said. “We could be investing in this site.” 
Metro Council approved the $44 million purchase of the mall in 2022, when Cooper’s original idea included renting a portion of the property to Vanderbilt University Medical Center, though Cooper did not secure a legally binding agreement with VUMC before the vote. A formal agreement with Vanderbilt never came to pass. Demolition of the mall’s interior began in 2024, and a public comment period for the city’s plans for the building began that summer.
The city is expected to conduct a transportation infrastructure study of the area this year to inform plans for a WeGo transit center.
The East Bank development plan was also created under the Cooper administration. 
Styles has taken issue with O’Connell’s leadership and decisions his administration has made on several issues since he was elected as mayor in 2023. 
She advocated for an investigation of Metro’s Office of Emergency Management amid claims of harassment by Director Steve Martini, who was recently placed on leave after a report substantiated the claims. 
During her first term, she pushed for the creation of the Nashville Music, Film and Entertainment Commission.
Styles has also been the subject of two ethics complaints, and a Metro Human Resources report finding she behaved inappropriately towards employees of the Metro Arts Commission during a 2024 period of upheaval. 
O’Connell is expected to run for reelection but with the election more than 18 months away, has not formally announced. 
West Nashville activist Lou Wilbanks has also said she will run to be Nashville’s chief executive.
Styles has a bachelor’s degree from Wellesley College and a master’s degree from Purdue University. She has worked in the entertainment industry since moving to Nashville in 2006.

WILMINGTON, Del. — Avelo Airlines is extending its flight schedule at Wilmington Airport through the peak summer travel season in 2026, giving Delaware Valley travelers more time to plan vacations with low-cost, nonstop options from a newly upgraded regional airport.
The airline announced Tuesday that flights from Wilmington Airport (ILG) are now available for booking through Aug. 18, 2026, with one-way fares starting at $52, available at AveloAir.com.
“It’s time to start planning summer travel, and we are excited to extend Avelo’s ILG flight schedule through August 2026,” said Trevor Yealy, Avelo’s head of commercial operations, in a statement. “With Avelo’s affordable fares and industry-leading reliability, it’s the perfect time for travelers to get a start on booking their summer vacations or weekend getaways.”
From its Wilmington base, Avelo will continue summer service to eight leisure-focused destinations popular with families, retirees, and regional travelers:


Fort Lauderdale, Florida (FLL)


Fort Myers, Florida (RSW)


Myrtle Beach, South Carolina (MYR)


Orlando, Florida (MCO)


Lakeland, Florida (LAL)


San Juan, Puerto Rico (SJU)


Tampa, Florida (TPA)


Wilmington, North Carolina (ILM)


The extended flight schedule comes as major renovations at Wilmington Airport near completion, marking a significant milestone in the airport’s transformation into a modern, passenger-friendly regional hub. The upgrades include expanded terminal space, improved amenities, and enhanced passenger flow, designed to support increased service while maintaining the airport’s reputation for convenience and ease of travel.
Local and regional leaders have increasingly pointed to the airport’s growth as a quality-of-life benefit for New Castle County, offering residents easier access to nonstop leisure destinations, reduced travel stress, and a practical alternative to larger, more congested airports. The combination of expanded air service and modernized facilities is expected to strengthen the county’s appeal to families, businesses, and visitors alike.
Avelo has positioned Wilmington Airport as a convenient alternative to larger regional airports, emphasizing nonstop routes, shorter security lines, and lower parking costs. The ILG location serves travelers from Delaware, southeastern Pennsylvania, and southern New Jersey.
Founded in 2021, Avelo Airlines operates a fleet of Boeing Next Generation 737 aircraft and serves more than 30 destinations nationwide. The company plans to become the first U.S. airline to operate Embraer 195-E2 aircraft beginning in 2028, with an order of up to 100 planes.
In addition to Wilmington, Avelo operates base locations at Tweed-New Haven Airport in Connecticut, Lakeland International Airport in Florida, and Concord-Padgett Regional Airport near Charlotte, North Carolina.

This photo provided to Mississippi Today, of a Snapchat account labeled “Spencer,” shows Stephen Spencer Pittman, 19, who has been indicted  on state and federal arson charges in the Jan. 10, 2026, fire that heavily damaged Mississippi’s largest synagogue.
Stephen Spencer Pittman, 19, of Madison, pleaded not guilty to an arson charge Tuesday during his first in-person appearance in court.
The Beth Israel Congregation synagogue in northeast Jackson was heavily damaged in the Jan. 10 predawn fire. Pittman was indicted five days later on the federal charge of using fire to maliciously damage or destroy a building involved in interstate commerce.
Pittman – who usually goes by his middle name – made his first appearance in federal court on Jan. 12 after authorities filed a sworn statement about charges he could face. He appeared then by video conference from a hospital where he was being treated for burns.
Attorneys went back and forth Tuesday over whether Pittman committed a “crime of violence,” a legal standard permitting the government to detain a defendant pre-trial, when he allegedly burned the synagogue 
U.S. Magistrate Court Judge LaKeysha Greer Isaac did not rule on that argument, but she found the prosecution had shown that Pittman posed a threat to prospective witnesses, particularly his parents. The judge did not deem Pittman a flight risk, due to his third-degree burns and lack of discernable income. 
Though his name does not appear on the docket, the U.S. Marshals Service is holding Pittman at the Madison County detention center, a spokesperson told Mississippi Today. He appeared in court Tuesday wearing an orange jumpsuit, with both hands heavily bandaged except for his right thumb.

Gov. Jim Pillen named Larsen the permanent Department of Economic Development director in November. She had served as interim director since July following former director K.C. Belitz’ resignation. Prior to her appointment, Larsen served as Pillen’s general counsel and deputy director of his Policy Research Office.

Larsen, speaking before the Nebraska Legislature’s Banking, Commerce and Insurance Committee, spoke on the possibility of a merger when she was asked about the state’s lagging tourism revenues. According to Tourism Commission data, state and county lodging taxes dipped by about $1 million in 2025, compared to 2024 collections.
Larsen argued that consolidating the agencies would mean tourism initiatives would have a larger budget and more marketing resources to pull from, and DED has the capacity to utilize grant funding for tourism efforts. She noted that prior to 2012, the two agencies were one in the same.
“If you’re trying to recruit businesses, if you’re trying to recruit that talent to keep people in Nebraska, tourism is a giant component of that,” Larsen said.
Committee Chair State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte, who introduced an interim study Tuesday to examine the potential impacts of merging the agencies, asked Larsen if she knew why the agencies split in 2012. Larsen, though she wasn’t in state government at the time, said it was her understanding that lawmakers didn’t believe DED was doing an effective job of handling tourism.
Larsen also was asked about downsizing at DED during Larsen’s leadership. Between September and November, at least 22 workers exited the department, and more high-ranking officials have left since then.
DED’s housing director resigned in December, and its deputy director Joe Fox plans to resign within the next two weeks, as confirmed by multiple sources.
When first asked by the Examiner in November, department spokesman Justin Pinkerman said in an email that “DED has had 0 layoffs/reductions in force.” He did note that the department “has had voluntary departures in that time” but did not specify how many.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Former DED deputy director of operations Joe Lauber, who was laid off over the summer, said there were signs of budget cuts impacting DED prior to his termination, like hiring freezes and directives to stop travel. He said during a management meeting he attended, then-interim director Larsen shared that it was the governor’s goal to reduce the size of DED through attrition.
Agencies often do this by not filling positions people vacate through retirements and having or encouraging people to leave on their own. Lauber said the state implemented strategies such as Pillen’s return-to-work order and enforcing a strict 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. work schedule in hopes of getting people to consider whether they wanted to keep working for the department. Lauber said employees were not allowed to end their days earlier than 4:30 p.m.
Larsen addressed the return-to-work policy at Tuesday’s hearing, saying that after she entered DED she realized that many employees were still working from home, and she enforced the policy to hold the staff accountable to the governor’s order so “everybody was on the same playing field.”
“I would never ask anyone else to work more than I do, or work in a place that I wouldn’t,” Larsen said.
Larsen said the downsizing can largely be attributed to high turnover, which she said is normal for DED, and an intentional winding down of pandemic-era programs. She said DED received an influx of cash during the COVID-19 pandemic — to the tune of about $900 million — which created several new programs that are now concluding.
Pinkerman shared data showing that between 2020 to 2023, the department’s full-time staff grew by about 10-15 people per year. It reached a peak of about 114 filled full-time positions on June 30, 2025, which dropped down to around 90 by the end of November.
“As DED winds down pandemic-era economic recovery programs and identifies greater operational efficiencies, not all positions that come open are being filled,” Pinkerman said in an email.

Montana plaintiffs and their attorneys pose outside the courtroom for photos halfway through the trial. (Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)After the Montana Supreme Court rejected a request by 16 young plaintiffs to hear a challenge to several 2025 laws that allegedly violate the youths’ constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment, the lawsuit has been refiled in district court.
Held v. State of Montana II, filed last week in Montana’s First Judicial District Court under Judge Kathy Seeley, is challenging the constitutionality of a series of bills passed by the 2025 Republican-led Legislature as a direct response to the ruling.
Held II involves 13 youth from the historic constitutional climate lawsuit Held v. State, in which Seeley and the state Supreme Court found there is a state right to a clean and healthful environmental, including a stable climate system. Three additional Montana youth have joined the sequel case.
Rikki Held, the lead plaintiffs in the lawsuits, said the young people are essentially “forced” back to court because the state continues to ignore the constitution and the supreme court’s ruling recognizing the right to a stable climate.
“In the 2025 legislative session, our state passed new laws limiting review of climate impacts and preventing state agencies from using environmental review information to deny or limit new permits for fossil fuel development,” Held said in a press release. “Since these laws have been in place, 44 new fossil fuel projects have moved forward unchecked, exacerbating the harms we are already living with including wildfire smoke, precipitation variability, drought, and polluted rivers and lands.”
During a signing ceremony a signing ceremony for five bills that altered the Montana Environmental Policy Act and Montana Clean Air Act in response to the Held decision, Speaker of the House Brandon Ler, R-Savage, said the lawsuit had tried to “twist MEPA into something it was never meant to be — a tool to deny permits and block development.”
The new petition against the state, Gov. Greg Gianforte, and the Department of Environmental Quality, seeks to overturn three laws passed last year — House Bills 285 and 291, as well as Senate Bill 221.
In a statement provided to the Daily Montanan when the petition was originally filed with the Supreme Court in December, Ler said the “activists are using the courts to achieve outcomes they cannot win through the legislative process,” undermining the separation of powers in Montana.
Ler sponsored House Bill 285, which passed along party lines. He said it was designed to provide clarity and efficiency to MEPA.
While the law adds a mechanism for agencies to conduct greenhouse gas analysis of proposed actions, it emphasizes MEPA is a tool for assessing environmental impacts without regulatory teeth.
It specifically states that “An agency may not withhold, deny, or impose conditions on any permit or other authority to act,” based on MEPA, but the Held litigants argue the change effectively “blinded” state agencies by prohibiting the use of information gathered during MEPA reviews to alter a permit, even if the environmental impacts could be a violation of the state constitution.
“The laws unconstitutionally eliminate a means to prevent harms from happening before they occur,” the petition states.
Senate Bill 221, brought by Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, also changed MEPA by narrowing the scope of review to “proximate” environmental impacts and defining a “proposed action” as excluding “upstream, downstream, or other indirect action that occurs independently or is caused in part or exclusively by the proposed action.”
“Such restrictions on the scope of environmental reviews under MEPA require agencies to turn a blind eye to known environmental harms caused by fossil fuel projects and (greenhouse gas) emissions,” the petition states, preventing agencies from making “informed decisions.”
A third challenged law, HB 291, brought by Rep. Greg Oblander, R-Billings, prohibits the state from adopting more stringent standards for air pollutants than the federal government.
The lawsuit argues the provision turns the floor of the federal Clean Air Act regulations “into a ceiling,” and creates a barrier to DEQ’s ability to “prevent, abate and control Montana’s (greenhouse gas) emissions,” which, in turn, would alleviate the injuries suffered by the youth.
“This case is about enforcing a binding constitutional duty, restoring the state’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas pollution, and protecting the rights of Montana children before more irreversible harm occurs,” Nate Bellinger, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “Every day these laws remain in effect, the harms to Montana’s climate, communities, and youth grow worse. We are ready to hold the state accountable and ensure that Montana upholds the constitutional rights of its youngest residents.”

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-20 21:35:46+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Fewer Mississippians enroll in Marketplace health insurance plans, early data shows",Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/20/fewer-mississippi-health-insurance/,"Pages from the U.S. Affordable Care Act health insurance website healthcare.gov are seen on a computer screen in New York on Tuesday, Aug. 19, 2025.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Affordable Care Act Marketplace enrollments in Mississippi are down about 8% compared to the same time last year following the expiration of enhanced subsidies that made health insurance more affordable for millions of Americans, according to initial data from the federal government published last week.
As of Jan. 3, over 307,000 Mississippi had made selections for Marketplace health plans, which primarily insure small business owners, employees, farmers or people who are self-employed, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data. That figure trends down from 330,000 people enrolled at about the same time last year — a year that marked an all-time high for enrollments in Mississippi. Open enrollment closed Jan. 15. 
“This dip is alarming, but we don’t have all the data needed to give us the real picture of the impact of the enhanced premium tax credits going away,” said Kimberly Hughes, government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network in Mississippi, in a statement. 
Experts told Mississippi Today they expect enrollments to fall further, because people may disenroll from coverage when they receive their first bill reflecting a higher monthly premium.
The enhanced subsidies, which made coverage more affordable for over 22 million Americans, were an added boost authorized by Congress in 2021 to raise the income ceiling for eligibility and allow low-income households to access insurance without paying premiums during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
During that time, the number of Mississippians enrolled in Marketplace health insurance tripled. That increase amounted to over 200,000 people between 2021 and 2025, according to enrollment data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. During the same period, the rate of people without insurance – one of the highest rates in the country – dropped by over 65,000 people.
But without the enhanced subsidies, the cost of premiums for Marketplace plans will more than double on average this year, according to KFF, though the rate changes will vary based on age, income and location.
Republicans and Democrats in Congress have tussled for months over whether or not to extend the subsidies, but have not yet reached a deal. The House of Representatives passed a three-year extension of the subsidies on Jan. 13 after over a dozen Republicans broke with their party to support their renewal. The Senate rejected a similar proposal in December, with Sens. Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith voting against extending the subsidies. 
Because Mississippi has opted not to expand Medicaid coverage, more low-income people depend on the Marketplace for health coverage, said Khaylah Scott, program manager for the Mississippi Health Access Program. 
“For a lot of Mississippians, this is their only option,” she said. 
The drop in plan selections in Mississippi is twice as high as the country as a whole. Nationwide, Americans saw a 4% decrease based on initial numbers. U.S. enrollment declined by about 800,000 people compared to the same time period last year and about 1.5 million people from last year’s total enrollment. 
Scott said her organization has clearly seen the effects of the expiring subsidies in a surge of calls to its free helpline, Health Help Mississippi.
The nonprofit logged about 1,000 intakes last year, up from 400 the year before. Just two weeks into the new year, the program had already performed over 100 intakes. 
Among the callers, Scott said, was a woman calling on behalf of her brother, who has congestive heart failure. His premium for Marketplace insurance last year was $25, but this year, he was quoted at over $300 a month. He doesn’t have the option to let his coverage lapse, and plans to be more frugal and cut back on unnecessary spending in order to save up for the higher premium. 
A 63-year-old woman who called the help line saw her premiums increase from $70 to $540 a month. She will go without health insurance for a year and a half, when she becomes eligible for Medicare. Her 25-year-old son, whose premiums rose $395 a month, will also go without coverage. 
Scott said it’s been difficult for her organization to listen to Mississippians share their struggles accessing affordable health insurance coverage, knowing there is little they can do to help lower costs. 
“It’s been really tough telling people there’s nothing we can do…. It’s really in Congress’ hands right now.” 
The Urban Institute, a policy think tank, predicted in September that about 150,000 people in Mississippi would drop their Marketplace coverage if the increased subsidies were not extended — one of the steepest dropoffs in the country. The organization also estimated that uninsurance rates in Mississippi would rise by 65%.
Initial data shows a less steep drop off in coverage, but there is no evidence to suggest that the estimates should be adjusted at this point, said Matthew Buettgens, one of the authors of the study. 
Buettgens said he expects to see a more clear picture of how the expired subsidies have influenced enrollment when data showing the number of people who have paid their initial premium payments is released. This data is typically released in the summer. 
CMS data shows that more than half of Mississippians insured through the Marketplace were automatically re-enrolled last year, suggesting many people may not have reviewed their premiums or actively updated their coverage this year. 
Though open enrollment has now ended, Congress could opt to create an additional enrollment period, he said. But even so, many people will still experience a gap in coverage or pay higher premiums in order to maintain their insurance. 
Several states, including Connecticut and Pennsylvania, have extended their open enrollment period through the end of the month to give people more time to sign up. 
The expiration of Marketplace subsidies is also not the only factor expected to affect health insurance coverage rates, Buettgens said, pointing to changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald J. Trump this summer. 
The law requires more frequent eligibility determinations for Medicaid beginning at the end of this year, which is expected to result in fewer people with health insurance. Fewer lawfully present immigrants, including refugees, people granted political asylum and victims of domestic violence and trafficking will be eligible for Medicaid or Marketplace financial assistance beginning in 2026. 
“The declines that we see this year, that’s not the end of it,” Buettgens said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/14092325/AP25301624742312.jpg,,,2026-01-20 16:56:41.979751

NV Energy balks at call to fully repay overcharged customers 

The utility, which owed customers a total of $65.4 million, according to state regulators, initially offered to reimburse a portion of affected customers just $2.5 million, claiming regulations limited their obligation to repay customers for just six months of overcharges. 
Just weeks ago, the company upped its offer to reimburse customers for overcharges back to 2017, adding the offer “substantially exceeds the Companies’ legal obligations and ensures prompt compensation for impacted customers.”
Court action on the part of state regulators, NV Energy asserted, would delay reimbursement.
On Tuesday, NV Energy called its latest proposal “the right thing to do” and thanked the Public Utility Commission for its help “in developing a resolution that makes current customers whole again.” 
The offer “ensures that compensation is provided expeditiously” following PUC approval, NV Energy said.
The utility initially acknowledged overcharging some 60,000 customers by roughly $17 million, the Current reported in May, but the company later found through an audit it had overcharged another 20,000  “previously unidentified ‘multi-family accounts’ for an undisclosed amount.” 
An investigation by PUC staff discovered more than 100,000 customers were affected by the overcharging, which was caused by the misclassification of multi-family units as single-family homes, which pay a higher rate. 
Additional details will be available on the company’s website in the coming days, the news release said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nvenergyclarkstn-1024x627.jpg,,,2026-01-20 16:56:41.979751

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) A Senate Republican leader introduced two pieces of legislation Tuesday to address ongoing issues with property rights and eminent domain. 

One bill would allow hazardous liquid pipeline operators to choose alternative routes to avoid the use of eminent domain and another would place a severance tax on sequestered carbon dioxide.
Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, said Tuesday to members of the media that he believes the bills will provide “abundant and affordable energy” while allowing Iowans to “exercise their private property rights,” allow private investments to help the state grow and “accelerate Iowa’s path to zero income tax.”
“I believe the proposals we are introducing today in the Senate will get us to the point where we all but eliminate the need for utilizing eminent domain for carbon capture pipelines or any other (hazardous liquid) pipelines, while still recognizing the fact that Iowa needs to have investment in linear infrastructure, but also recognizing the importance of landowner rights,” Klimesh said.

The Senate bills differ from a bill filed and advanced by House Republicans that would ban carbon sequestration pipelines from using eminent domain. Lobbyists for Summit Carbon Solutions, an Iowa-based company seeking to build a carbon capture and sequestration pipeline through the state, said the House bill would kill the Summit pipeline project. 
Landowners and lawmakers in support of the House bill have said it is the best way to protect private property rights from a project they argue is not a public use. 
Corn farmers and ethanol producers in favor of carbon sequestration pipelines said the Senate bill would help the project secure as many voluntary easements as possible to get the project done. 
Kelly Nieuwenhuis, an O’Brien County farmer, said he and his brothers have signed contracts for more than three miles of easements with Summit and he hopes other landowners can do the same if the Senate’s bill is successful.
“We’ve had great negotiations with (Summit), great communications and no issues at all, so I’m hoping more people find that same situation, and so we can find people are willing to have the project go across their property, “Nieuwenhuis said while at the Iowa State Capitol Tuesday to speak with lawmakers about the Summit project. 
Widening the corridors
Klimesh said under Senate File 2067, eminent domain – or the taking of private property with just compensation for public use – would be a “last resort” for hazardous liquid pipelines. 
Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh discusses two bills he introduced to address eminent domain and property rights in Iowa Jan. 20, 2026. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)
Rather than stick directly with their Iowa Utilities Commission approved routes, hazardous liquid pipeline operators, not just carbon sequestration pipeline operators, would be able to “actively pursue alternative routes” with landowners within a voluntary easement corridor. Klimesh explained this corridor included land anywhere within the county or within five miles of the initially proposed route.
“The Senate Republican caucus doesn’t want eminent domain to be utilized,” Klimesh said. “I mean, we want to try to minimize the impact of eminent domain of building any infrastructure projects.” 
Under the bill, a pipeline operator must demonstrate to the Iowa Utilities Commission that it “diligently sought to devise a route of voluntary easements” and was unable to do so, before it can request eminent domain power. 
Jess Mazour, the conservation program associate with Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, said the proposal from Klimesh “does not address property rights.” The House bill, which is on the schedule for debate Wednesday, she said does protect property rights by blocking the use of eminent domain. 
Mazour alleged that Summit has been unwilling to reroute within its existing corridors and wondered what difference a larger corridor, as proposed by Klimesh’s bill, would make. 
“A lot of the stuff that he’s saying is simply just a misdirection and a distraction away from the issue at hand, which is property rights, and the ability for someone to say no,” Mazour said. “And that’s not addressed in his bill whatsoever.” 
Klimesh argued the bill allows property owners to say no by giving pipeline operators a different option. 
“This is a relationship would allow the property owner that does not wish to enter a voluntary easement to say no,” Klimesh said. “Currently under Iowa law, that pipeline company has no other option to go around that landowner – this allows that option to take place.” 
The bill also has a provision that would allow landowners to opt out of communications, other than mail, from pipeline operators. Klimesh explained the bill allows a one-year time frame for easement acquisitions, to keep the process from being “open ended.” 
According to Klimesh, the bill would affect the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, which was granted a permit by the IUC in 2024, but he said it also applies to other hazardous liquid pipelines that want to cross through Iowa in the future. 
Summit, in a statement, said it “remain(s) committed” to working with landowners and lawmakers on solutions that “protect property rights and support rural economies.” 
“As proposals like this are considered, it’s important to maintain clarity, respect landowner interests, and avoid limiting economic opportunity for agriculture and rural communities,” the statement said. 
Mike Henning, a landowner in Greene County affected by and opposed to the pipeline, said the House bill would protect property rights and allow for the development of carbon pipelines.
“We’ve heard what’s in Sen. Klimesh’s bill and it’s not what landowners have spent five years asking for. Nor is it what Governor Reynolds asked for after vetoing our last piece of legislation,” Henning said in a news release.
The Legislature passed a bill to limit the use of eminent domain on carbon sequestration projects in 2025, but Gov. Kim Reynolds vetoed the bill, in part because of its complexity.
Severance tax on CO2 
The second bill would apply a severance tax – or a tax applied on the removal of natural resources – on the carbon dioxide transported through the pipeline. 
Klimesh said this tax revenue would go to Iowa’s Taxpayer Relief Fund to “continue Iowa’s path to zero income tax.” 
The tax would be applied at a flat fee per metric ton. 
States like Wyoming, North Dakota and Texas have severance taxes on oil and gas that is extracted in the state. 
Good for corn, ‘energy dominance’ 
Klimesh said his legislative proposals will be good for Iowa farmers as carbon capture pipelines are slated to increase demand in the ethanol industry by allowing refineries to more easily participate in the ultra-low carbon ethanol markets. 
He noted that farmers logged a record high year for corn production. According to USDA figures, Iowa farmers produce 2.77 billion bushels of corn in 2025. Nearly 60% of Iowa-grown corn goes to the ethanol industry. 
“It’s of the utmost importance that we gain access to new low carbon ethanol markets to ensure Iowa farmers and Iowa can not only survive but thrive,” Klimesh said. 
Nieuwenhuis said there are additional ways for ethanol plants to reduce their carbon intensity score, a figure which represents the greenhouse gas emissions of a product, but none that do so as intensely as access to a carbon sequestration pipeline.
Klimesh additionally stressed the importance of his legislation as it relates to the Trump administration’s goal for energy dominance. 
Language in the federal “one big beautiful” law made it so carbon sequestration pipelines can get enhanced tax credits when the CO2 is injected into the ground near existing oil fields in a process called enhanced oil recovery. 
The pressure from the CO2 can make oil recovery processes more effective. 
While Summit lobbyists also mentioned the prospect of enhanced oil recovery during a subcommittee meeting on the House-proposed bill, the company has not said if it intends to change its route from its current ending destination in North Dakota, to an area with greater potential for enhanced oil recovery. 
Klimesh, when asked if he had the necessary votes to pass the bill, said he would not discuss “internal caucus matters.” The issue of eminent domain has caused a level of division within Iowa Republicans, notably from a group of Republican senators who refused to debate budget bills last session until the chamber held debate on the House’s eminent domain bill.

The 93-0 vote Tuesday advances House Bill 1035 to the Senate for its consideration.

“We’ve got kids who are unleashed in the digital world and yet restrained in the physical world,” Teshka said. “Evidence has consistently shown that age appropriate independence actually strengthens decision making, risk assessment, self control, improves social skills and academic performance.”
The bill defines “independent activity” to include walking or traveling on foot or by bicycle, playing outdoors, remaining at home, or staying in a stationary vehicle without direct supervision. 
It additionally specifies that parents wouldn’t be subject of Department of Child Services investigation “solely because the child engages in an independent activity,” unless a parent or guardian acted “so reckless as to endanger the health or safety of the child,” taking into account the child’s “maturity, condition and ability.”",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/33B82BC8-A0B4-41D1-8F0E-9C75716E8D68_1_201_a-1024x521.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 16:56:41.979751

He leaves behind a mixed record.(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Phil Murphy left office Tuesday at noon after eight years as New Jersey’s governor, two terms highlighted by tumult.
His first years in office were marked by political scandal and Democratic infighting. He was among the first governors forced to deal with COVID-19, which began spreading while he was hospitalized for cancer surgery. In 2021, he became the first Democratic governor in nearly 50 years to win reelection. He helped lead a bungled attempt to get his wife elected to the U.S. Senate, a move that not only killed her political ambitions but also destroyed the county line. And he landed in the crosshairs of the second Trump administration when he appeared to say he’d hide an undocumented immigrant in his Middletown mansion.
We sat down with Murphy recently to ask him about the highlights and lowlights of the last eight years. His left office at noon, with Gov. Mikie Sherrill (D) succeeding him.
 Good: Pensions
Even Republicans who hate most of Murphy’s budgetary ideas give him kudos for his commitment to boosting the health of our state’s pension fund. Murphy’s predecessors of both parties either ignored the fund or contributed little so that they could spend elsewhere, but Murphy boosted annual pension payments to record highs.
Under Murphy these payments amounted to about $47 billion over eight years, more than twice the $22.7 billion paid by other governors since the 1997 fiscal year. The health of our pension funding is still bad compared to other states, but it’s far healthier than it was when Murphy took over.
“I am very proud we are who we said we would be, and I know that sounds corny, but that doesn’t happen that often in this line of business. We campaigned a certain way, and we have governed largely, if not overwhelmingly, in that way,” Murphy said.
 Bad: Transparency
Murphy caved to legislators who made it their mission in recent years to make sure the public knows less about what their elected officials and political candidates are up to, by signing a rewrite of the Open Public Records Act that makes it harder to gain access to government documents.
Murphy waived away his responsibility for the OPRA rewrite, loathed by journalists and citizen watchdogs as a transparent attempt to put roadblocks in front of anyone trying to uncover malfeasance in government, by saying it wasn’t his idea.
“I didn’t run to reform OPRA. Others had a higher passion for that than I did, and you sort of make tradeoffs,” Murphy said.
I have no doubt lawmakers desperate to keep their records away from our prying eyes tried to hold the rest of Murphy’s agenda hostage in exchange for his signature on this bill. He should have resisted.

 In-between: COVID-19
Murphy won a lot of praise from Democrats during the early months of the COVID-19 crisis as he sought to limit the spread of the virus by closing businesses and schools, restricting the size of public gatherings, cutting the prison population, and more.
There were naysayers then, as there are now. Some of them, I think, forget the sheer magnitude of this unprecedented crisis, with bodies piling up in hospitals and medical professionals stretched to their limit.
But surely, I thought, in hindsight Murphy could name one or two things he would have done differently?
Nope. Murphy could not cite a single thing. When I asked whether he thought his administration’s strategy on nursing homes deserved a second look, he called the premise of my question faulty.
As a reminder, on March 31, 2020, the Murphy administration ordered nursing homes to readmit patients who tested positive for COVID-19, as long as the homes could separate them from the general population. This doomed many of our seniors. More than 10,000 nursing home residents died in the first four months of the pandemic.
Murphy insists that nursing home operators are at fault for not obeying the administration’s directive to separate sick patients from well ones.
“We said, you’ve got to do three things. It’s either: minimum, a different floor; better, a different wing; even better, a different building. And by the way, you can’t take care of, as a health care professional, one group over here and one group over there. We were crystal, crystal, crystal clear,” he said.
The independent review Murphy ordered of his administration’s response to the pandemic says too few nursing homes “could readmit such patients while following infection control guidance and maintaining safety protocols.” In the weeks following the Murphy administration’s readmission directive, the virus ran rampant in nursing homes, and the directive was retracted on April 13, 2020, the report says. COVID-positive nursing home patients were moved to separate facilities.
At least one lawsuit filed against the Murphy administration by the families of three people who died in nursing homes in the first wave of COVID was dismissed because, the judge said, the administration acted “at a time that it was not sufficiently clear to a reasonable official that what he or she was doing violated” anyone’s rights. That may be true, and to look back on it all now and deny you could have done anything differently may be legally sound. But it is not morally sound.
 Good: pardons
It took Murphy seven years to issue a pardon, but once he did, he couldn’t stop, pardoning or commuting sentences for more than 450 people in the last 13 months. Plus, unlike with pardons issued by presidents like Joe Biden or Donald Trump, most of Murphy’s orders don’t reek of favor-trading. He created a clemency board to review pardon and commutation requests to make sure that the people receiving them had reformed or had been punished too severely for their actions and deserved a break.
Murphy said he takes a number of things into consideration when deciding whether to grant clemency to someone.
“How good a citizen have you been in the system? Or if you’re looking for a pardon or a commute from lifetime parole, how’s your life been once you’re out of the system? Are you offense-free? So there’s a lot of things you have to consider,” he said. “We talk about when you pardon someone or commute their sentence or commute their parole, you put a family back together again, because the family has been challenged in their — and I always add, by the way, we take the victims’ side of that as seriously, in terms of what their family looks like, and the impact on their families.”
 Bad: NJ Transit
NJ Transit is no doubt in a better place than it was when Murphy was elected governor after campaigning to fix it.
But its service is still so unreliable that I don’t use it because I don’t know if it’ll take me to my destination or, say, drop me off eight stops from where I started and then tell me the train has been canceled so I’ll have to figure out a way to New York City on my own (that happened recently to one of my colleagues, and she still hasn’t gotten a refund). Yet Murphy acts like he’s fixed the agency.
“On-time performance, customer satisfaction, safety are all dramatically different and better than they were when we first got here,” he said, later adding, “Someone independently studied the time it took to move people into Taylor Swift and out of Taylor Swift in every North American concert she did, and we were far and away the winner.”
It’s great for Taylor Swift fans that NJ Transit aced it on three days in May 2023. But we need that kind of performance every day. I hope Sherrill takes NJ Transit more than Murphy does — that may be the only way the agency becomes as good as we need it to be.

 In-between: Trenton’s political culture
It feels a bit unfair to lay the blame for Trenton’s often noxious political culture on Murphy, since only a miracle worker could make that kind of change in eight years.
But he certainly didn’t make it better, rolling over for legislative leaders who wanted to avoid paying steep fines for political misbehavior and also kneecap watchdogs seeking their emails.
Murphy said he does not agree with progressive Democrats who view the New Jersey Statehouse as a haven for corruption. What they see as corruption, Murphy said, he sees as normal politics.
“If you are a purist and you cannot countenance compromise, this is not your state. I suspect politics should not be your chosen line of business either, because it’s a little bit like, you know, Bogart/Claude Rains in ‘Casablanca,’ where there’s gambling going around the back room. You have to compromise. You have to get around a table, and sometimes you have to accept stuff,” he said.
So, using Murphy’s own analogy, one side of Trenton’s Democratic power structure is cinema’s most famous saloon owner, and the other is … cinema’s most famous Nazi collaborator. Let us pray.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The race to be Rhode Island’s next attorney general became more crowded Tuesday after State Rep. Joseph J. Solomon Jr. announced his long-awaited primary bid.
Solomon, a Warwick Democrat, is the fourth candidate to announce his intention to replace the term-limited Peter Neronha in a race that includes Kimberly Ahern, Keith Hoffmann and fellow state Rep. Jason Knight — all of whom have touted their prior experience working at the AG’s office at some point in their legal careers.
The 42-year-old offers a different resume, instead leaning on his own 15-year legal career that includes over a decade of work as a bail commissioner and prosecution experience in the Warwick solicitor’s office.
“I’m not running to learn on the job,” Solomon said in a statement. “I’ve spent my career in the courtroom, making the tough calls as a bail commissioner, and writing laws that protect Rhode Island families. I’ve already been doing this work, and Rhode Island deserves an Attorney General who shows up ready on day one.”
Solomon has served in the Rhode Island House of Representatives since 2015. For the past five years, he has chaired the chamber’s Committee on Corporations — which is responsible for laws on the state’s financial institutions, business regulation, property, casualty and health insurance, technology, telecommunications and consumer protection.
Solomon joins the race with more cash on hand than any of his opponents as of the state’s most recent reporting deadline of Sept. 30.
Solomon reported $251,816 in his campaign account, while Hoffmann had $205,680, and Knight had $94,786. 
Ahern — who joined after the reporting deadline — announced on Jan. 14 her campaign raised $273,000 in the last quarter of 2025. She welcomed Solomon’s entry into the Democratic primary Tuesday afternoon.
“I look forward to a spirited campaign and a substantive conversation about how best to keep Rhode Islanders safe,” Ahern said in a statement. “The Attorney General is the state’s top law enforcement officer, and we need a prosecutor — not a politician — with a proven track record of putting dangerous criminals behind bars, defending our fundamental rights, and fighting for working families.”
Hoffman and Knight’s campaigns did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The state’s primary is scheduled for Sept. 8. The general election will be held Nov. 3.

Photo by Jon King.Tamela Peterson, the CEO of Oxford Center, who is already facing second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter charges in the death of a boy in one of its hyperbaric chambers, is now facing a new set of charges for health care fraud.
The Department of Attorney General on Tuesday announced that Peterson was arraigned by a Howell district court judge on nine counts of health care fraud, false claims, each a felony punishable by a four-year maximum prison sentence and or a $50,000 fine.
Peterson and three other former employees are currently facing charges in the death of a 5-year-old boy in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber explosion at the Oxford Center in Troy, Michigan.
Michigan attorney general charges 4 in death of 5-year-old boy killed in hyperbaric chamber fire

The new charges focus on the Oxford Recovery Center location in Brighton. Both locations treated patients for a wide range of mental health issues, including addiction related care, and included a large population of children diagnosed with autism in the center’s behavioral analysis program.
Attorney General Dana Nessel’s department alleges that Peterson had knowledge of and was the beneficiary of fraudulent health care claim practices, including billing for services not rendered to patients.
“Filing false claims impacts not only patients and providers, but also contributes to increased costs of healthcare and medical insurance for everybody,” Nessel said in a statement. “Health care fraud undermines the trust between patients and providers and patients’ notions of confidentiality and care. My office will continue to hold accountable those who take advantage of their practice for their own financial benefit.”
Peterson was granted a $10,000 personal recognizance bond, and will next appear in court on Jan. 27 for a probable cause conference. A preliminary examination, which will determine if she will be bound over to the circuit court for trial, is scheduled for Feb. 3.
Meanwhile, a hearing was scheduled Tuesday in Oakland County district court on whether Peterson and the other defendants should be bound over to circuit court for trial on the charges in the incident involving the boy’s death.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-20 21:00:36+00:00,CT Mirror,"ABLE CT program expanded to disabled veterans, others",Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/able-ct-program-expanded-to-disabled-veterans-others/,The ABLE CT program will allow more people with disabilities in CT to save money without jeopardizing their access to benefits.,"U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Treasurer Erick Russell announced on Tuesday the expansion of a program that will allow people with disabilities to save money without jeopardizing their access to benefits. 
The ABLE CT savings accounts previously served people who had experienced the onset of a disability before age 26; now the eligibility ceiling has been changed to before age 46, making around 6 million people newly eligible across with country, including thousands in Connecticut.
“Making more people aware is critical because the expansion is benefitting people only if they take advantage of it,” Blumenthal said at a press conference at Easterseals, a nonprofit that serves people with disabilities including veterans. “That 20 years of eligibility is hugely important to people who may be disabled. People may be disabled on the job.”
The program allows people to save money in a special tax-free account dubbed an ABLE CT account, named for the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act. Advocates say that the accounts represent a critical step to break the cycle of poverty that people can fall into when they become disabled: unable to save funds to supplement medical costs without jeopardizing their eligibility for benefits, bills for any number of expenses can plunge them into debt and even homelessness.
In Connecticut, the legislation also allows for deductions on state income taxes up to $10,000 for people filing jointly and up to $5,000 for single filers.
Advocates say that disabled veterans will be major beneficiaries of the change in age eligibility, since they often experience an onset of disability during their service and after the previous age 26 cut-off. 
“For people who aren’t able to gain employment and earn sustained gainful employment, this definitely assists with enriching their lives going forward,” said Ryan Landry, associate director of military services for the Capital region and Eastern Connecticut Easterseals, and a veteran U.S. Army sergeant.
Blumenthal, the ranking member on the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, said that veterans often have “invisible wounds” that leave them disabled.
“More and more invisible wounds that we’re learning can have disastrous effects on veterans — the burn pits in Afghanistan and Iraq, the contamination of water at Camp Lejeune,” Blumenthal said. “Veterans may be disabled for a vast variety of reasons, they get care and benefits from the VA, but in addition they can take advantage of these ABLE accounts. And that can be life saving.”
The expansion of the law was passed in 2022 and goes into effect this month. Similar to a 529, the money saved in the account can be invested and later withdrawn tax free, as long as it’s used for broad categories of disability-related expenses like housing, medical needs, job training and caregiving. In Connecticut, the federal law was adopted and also allows for a tax deduction for contributions to the ABLE accounts.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25126646848616-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 16:56:41.979751

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)With its skunky smell, marijuana may be one of the most odoriferous substances around.
In an attempt to get the smell of medical marijuana off Florida streets, parking lots, and beaches, and into private spaces instead, a state Senate committee unanimously approved Tuesday imposing a ban on public use of both pot and tobacco.
Sponsored by Sen. Joe Gruters, SB 986 would revise the state’s laws that prohibit smoking and vaping of tobacco in public spaces to also prohibit smoking or vaping of a marijuana. The companion measure, HB 389, is sponsored by Pensacola Republican Rep. Alex Andrade.
The bill defines the term “public place” to mean “a place to which the public has access, including, but not limited to, streets; sidewalks; highways; public parks; public beaches; and the common areas, both inside and outside, of schools, hospitals, government buildings, apartment buildings, office buildings, lodging establishments, restaurants, transportation facilities, and retail shops.”
Florida first banned smoking in public places in statutes in 1985. In 2002, Florida voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment to ban smoking in places like restaurants, government buildings, and health facilities. At the time, the amendment was pitched as a workplace safety issue. Opponents, meanwhile, argued it was a property rights issue and that government was overstepping its authority by banning smoking.
The Legislature responded the following year with “implementing” legislation that prohibits smoking in workplaces that previously allowed smoking. With the advent of electronic smoking devices, Florida voters in 2018 approved a second constitutional amendment that banned vaping and e-cigarettes in enclosed indoor workplaces.
Voters also approved in 2016 a constitutional amendment to make medical marijuana available to qualified patients. The Department of Health Office of Medical Marijuana Use reports that 931,959 patients qualified for medical marijuana in Florida as of Jan. 16. Although the marijuana is for medical reasons, only smoking is a legal route of administration.
A proposed constitutional amendment to allow adults to use marijuana recreationally was supported by 56% of the voters in 2024, but fell short of the 60% threshold needed to pass.
Gruters, now chair of the National Republican Party, supported the 2024 amendment to legalize marijuana, which put him at odds with Gov. Ron DeSantis, who opposed the idea. If recreational marijuana were legal, DeSantis said, Florida would “start to smell like marijuana in our cities and towns. The stench, he said, would “reduce the quality of life.”
In a hearing before the Senate Committee on Regulated Industries, Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association lobbyist Samantha Padgett didn’t take a position for or against the bill Tuesday. Instead, she “shared information” with the committee, telling members that the association supports adding vaping and smoking marijuana to the law, officially called the Florida Indoor Clean Air Act.
“This gives all employers the freedom to ensure a smoke-free environment in their places of employment,” she said.
But she said the association has heard from members worried the definition of public places is too broad and may impede restaurants from allowing smoking on patios or ban hotels from offering smoking rooms on certain floors.
Padgett said the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association worked closely with the Legislature on the implementing legislation for 2002 constitutional amendment to ensure that designated smoking areas would still be allowed.
“As a result, many of our members made significant investments to make sure those spaces that were on their properties are compliant with that statutory language,” she said adding, “We’d like to make sure that that ability continues.”

“This becomes a real property rights issue.
Florida Cannabis Action Network board president Jodi James argued the bill was overly broad and because of that has “some true unintended consequences.”
For instance, she said, some apartment complexes have policies that ban renters from smoking indoors, forcing people to go outdoors to smoke medical marijuana. “This is the place where a patient would take advantage of their ability to access state medicine,” she said.
She added that there are hotels across the state where smoking medical marijuana is approved by management. There also are hotels with designated smoking floors. None of that would be allowed under the bill, she said.
“This becomes a real property rights issue. The new definition of public places might very well include my front door, which would mean I couldn’t even step outside my home and smoke cannabis, which is my legally protected right. I think the most outrageous, though, is that my friend who owns property in Franklin County and who no longer uses the vapes that have tobacco in them but does use a vape with e-juice would be fined for sitting on her property near the beach using a vaporizer that contains no tobacco.”
Bill co-sponsor Sen. Ana Maria Rodriguez, a Republican from Doral, acknowledged that James’ points had merit. But she added: “Clearly there is a difference between someone’s front door and a public place where the general public can gather, whether it’s a restaurant, whether it’s in a park or a beach. Your house is a dwelling and the front door of your house isn’t the same as being in a public place.” Rodriguez said.
The bill also would prohibits smoking or vaping marijuana in a designated smoking room at any time, something not now prohibited by statute.
While the whiff of medical marijuana in public spaces is becoming more common, Rodriguez pitched the bill as necessary amid efforts to legalize adult recreational use of marijuana continue.
“Every state in the United States that allows adult use of marijuana has either a complete public smoking ban or tight restrictions to where marijuana smoking is allowed,” she said.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)City property — including parking lots, public schools, parks and municipal buildings — is off limits to federal immigration officers conducting enforcement operations, under an executive order signed by Providence Mayor Brett Smiley Tuesday.
Smiley told reporters gathered at City Hall that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in other blue cities made the order necessary to protect the community. He said he was unaware of any ICE actions on city property since the second Trump administration took over one year ago. However, immigration officers entered the state-owned Garrahy Judicial Complex on Dorrance Street on Jan. 15, bypassing security and prompting outrage from state leaders
“We’re taking clear action to affirm Providence’s values,” Smiley said before signing his first executive order of the year with a black pen. “We do not want — and will not allow — Providence’s public property to be used to execute what we see as unlawful immigration enforcement.”
Smiley held up a copy of a red sign city employees will post noting the use of city property as a federal immigration enforcement staging site is now prohibited. In the event ICE officers are seen on any city-owned property without a judicial warrant, Smiley said Providence police will be required to vacate the federal agents from it. 
“If Immigration and Customs Enforcement presents a valid judicial warrant, we will honor it,” the mayor said. “We honor it today, but the reality is that’s not what’s happening in most instances.”

Private property owners are welcome to go to the city’s website and download and print out the signs to identify “non-public areas of their property” where ICE activity is prohibited, according to Smiley’s executive order. Property owners can use signs “at their own discretion and assume any legal risk associated therewith.”
Smiley said he has been encouraging the state’s judicial branch to enact a similar policy and also expand the use of virtual court hearings in Providence to discourage additional ICE visits.
The Jan. 15 incident at the Garrahy Courthouse was the second time in three months that ICE officers entered a state courthouse. ICE officers briefly detained a teenage judicial intern outside of the Licht Judicial Complex in Providence on Nov. 20, sparking condemnation from state and local officials, including Gov. Dan McKee and Chief Justice Paul Suttell.
ICE did not immediately respond to request for comment on the Jan. 15 incident.
The Providence Journal reported “several” masked immigration officers ran through the first floor of the Garrahy Courthouse in pursuit of two young men though apparently did not take anyone into custody.
 “Allowing these barely-trained and reckless federal agents to blunder through our state, disrupting the justice system and harassing children and judges, diminishes the safety of our citizens and undermines the efforts of real law enforcement officers,” Lt. Gov Sabina Matos said in a Jan. 16 statement. “I am glad that this incident appears to have ended without harm to anyone, but we have all seen how this behavior leads to tragedy. ICE needs to be reined in and subject to the same laws that govern us all.”
The Judiciary enacted rules for virtual court hearings in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic and recently posted its revised policy for requesting such a hearing using an online form. A judicial officer makes the final determination on whether the hearing must be held in person or not.
“As has been the case since the Judiciary developed remote hearing access capabilities, members of the public may request that a pending hearing be conducted remotely,” Judiciary spokesperson Lexi Kriss said in a recent email to Rhode Island Current. “These requests are to be submitted to and considered by the judicial officer presiding over the matter.”
Smiley’s order follows a move by city officials in November to amend Providence’s Community-Police Relations Act to deter local police from interacting with federal immigration officers.
Smiley acknowledged his order may put Providence further in the Trump administration’s crosshairs. The president on Jan. 14 threatened to halt federal funding to so-called “sanctuary” cities and states starting Feb. 1 if they don’t honor his mass deportation policies.
But Smiley said the fear of federal retribution is outweighed by the need to let Providence residents know the city has their backs.
“There are families in Providence who are afraid,” he said. “My responsibility is to them, not anyone in Washington D.C.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Education groups and others raised questions Tuesday during an Iowa House subcommittee meeting about legislation that could potentially change continuing education requirements for licensed professionals.
House Study Bill 546 would bar bodies in charge of setting rules for continuing education in different licensed professions from requiring people take credits “not directly related to the practice of the licensed profession,” including attorneys.
Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, chaired the subcommittee and was joined by Rep. Ross Wilburn, D-Ames, and Rep. Heather Hora, R-Washington.

Professional Educators of Iowa, the Iowa Judicial Branch, Iowa State Education Association and Iowa Society of Certified Public Accountants are all registered as “undecided” on the bill, lobbyists from the organizations said during the subcommittee meeting, with some seeking further clarification on which continuing education courses would count as “not directly related to” their work.
“We certainly appreciate the goal of making sure that continued education and PD credits are topical and helpful and relevant, but we also support the idea of a little bit of discretion,” said Nathan Arnold, lobbyist for Professional Educators of Iowa.
One example Arnold gave of continuing education that could be construed as not connecting directly to the education profession was a course on identifying and preventing human trafficking offered by Professional Educators of Iowa. Melissa Peterson with the Iowa State Education Association said she’s unsure if training on seizure and concussion response would fall under continuing education, but they are popular programs and she wants more understanding of how they would be impacted.
Arnold told the subcommittee the organization doesn’t want to see programs like these “get unintentionally axed.”
Brad Epperly, representing the Iowa Society of Certified Public Accountants, said those in his profession and others have governing boards that prescribe required continuing education, and as those serving on the board were appointed to the position and are part of the profession, he believes these decisions should be left to them.
Iowa attorneys are currently required to complete “continuing legal education” courses in either the “wellness” or “diversity” categories, Iowa Judicial Branch lobbyist Caitlin Jarzen said, both of which are likely to be seen as not “directly related to the practice of law.”
However, she said Iowa Supreme Court Chief Justice Susan Christensen made wellness issues a focus in her Condition of the Judiciary address Jan. 14 and the branch sees benefits of continuing education requirements that might not align completely with practicing law.
When asked by Wilburn where continuing education focused on communication with people with disabilities such as hearing or visual impairment would be categorized, she said she believes it would fall under diversity.
Wilburn was the single no vote in moving the legislation to the Iowa House Higher Education Committee, citing concerns about the bill “being vague and a little too subjective.”
The legislation should provide more information on what counts as continuing education for different professions, he said, and ensure that licensed professionals can receive all the necessary training to meet state, regional or national accreditation requirements for their job.
“I think it’s important, when the Legislature puts something forward, that there’s clarity into what’s covered,” Wilburn said.
The legislation received approval from both Hora and Holt, though Holt said he would be interested in hearing more from the judicial branch about their discussions on the bill.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)A Phase III clinical trial including patients at the University of Oklahoma found that proton therapy improved survival and resulted in fewer side effects among people with head and neck cancer.


The trial was led by the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, enrolling 440 patients across 21 institutions.
It included oropharyngeal cancer patients, which includes the tonsils and the back part of the tongue. The incidence and mortality of oropharyngeal cancer have grown over the past three decades, particularly because of increases in HPV.
Researchers directly compared the impacts of proton and photon therapy on these patients.
Photon therapy is the most common type of radiation therapy, using high-energy X-rays to damage DNA inside cancer cells. Photons are wave particles: they don’t have physical mass, meaning they can pass in and out of the body.
But this also means radiation spreads beyond targeted areas, said Dr. Christina Henson, an associate professor of radiation oncology at the OU College of Medicine. In treating cancer in the neck, patients can experience side effects like dry mouth, sore throat and taste changes, making it difficult to eat. Some end up needing a feeding tube, she said.
Henson said photon therapy is a good treatment option. Now, she said, there’s an effort to help patients get through treatment with fewer side effects.
“There’s constantly a search for ways to decrease the dose of radiation to the normal tissues that are surrounding the tumor,” Henson said. “And so proton therapy has been one avenue that’s been explored for trying to do that.”
Protons have a physical mass and can be stopped at a certain depth inside tissue.
The therapy was first used in the 50s to treat limited areas in patients. Henson said its initial iterations weren’t precise. But, over the last decade, newer versions of proton machines have advanced to more effectively shape dosages.
In the trial, 221 patients were randomized to the proton group and 219 to the photon group. Five of them were patients at OU. Some patients in the proton section faced challenges with insurance declining to cover the therapy, Henson said, meaning they had to switch to the photon group.
Researchers found that, at five years, survival rates among patients who received proton therapy were 10% higher.
Henson said this seemed to be related to differences in the effects of radiation on the immune system.
“It seems that, potentially, the benefit of protons is that (they’re) just less toxic,” Henson said.
The trial’s findings may apply to other types of head and neck cancer, Henson said. She hopes the results will prompt insurers to cover proton therapy and additional trials on different cancers.
“Clinical trials often don’t go the way we expect them to, right? We’ll be really excited about a new therapy, and then the clinical trial shows that it didn’t make any difference or sometimes even that it made things worse,” Henson said. “So when we do get a trial that’s positive – especially when it’s strongly positive like this – it is very, very exciting.”

La Sasso’s decision takes him out of the 2026 Masters. He had earned an invitation to Augusta National based on the NCAA championship, but only if he had retained his amateur status through the Masters, April 9-12.
La Sasso will join World Golf Hall of Famer Phil Mickelson’s Hy Flyers GC on the LIV tour.
“It’s a rare opportunity to learn from one of the greatest players in the history of the game, and I don’t take that lightly,” La Sasso said in a statement. “LIV Golf allows me to compete at the highest level on a global stage, and I thrive in a team environment, especially one with the camaraderie and support that defines HyFlyers GC. My focus is on learning, continuing to improve, and doing everything I can to help our team succeed.”
Ole Miss begins its spring golf season Jan. 31 in the Thomas Sharkey Individual Collegiate at Statesboro, Georgia, a two-day event. The first full-team event will be the Water Sound Invitational Feb. 16-18 at Shark’s Tooth Golf Course in Inlet Beach, Florida.
“Clearly, it’s not ideal timing from a team standpoint,” Ole Miss golf coach Chris Malloy said in a phone interview. “But I am happy for Michael. Financially, this was a no-brainer for him. Still, he struggled with the decision because he is such a team guy.”
Michael La Sasso takes a selfie after winning the NCAA Division 1 Men’s Golf Championship at The Omni La Costa Golf Course in Carlsbad, California, on May 26, 2025. 
Financial terms of La Sasso’s LIV deal were not made available, but Malloy called it “certainly life-changing money.”
La Sasso, 21, is a Raleigh, North Carolina, native who transferred to Ole Miss from North Carolina State after his freshman season. Last year, he set the Ole Miss season scoring record, averaging 69.46 strokes per round. He was a consensus All-American.
Mickelson called La Sasso “one of the most exciting young players in the game today, bringing a competitive fire that’s evident every time he tee it up.
“He combines tremendous power and speed with an exceptional feel for the game,” Mickelson said in a statement. “Beyond his talent, his personality, work ethic, and commitment to being a great teammate make him a terrific addition to HyFlyers GC. We’re excited to support his development, accelerate his learning curve, and help him achieve his goals—while he, in turn, makes our team even stronger.”
Ole Miss was to enter the spring golf season as one of the favorites to win the NCAA team championship. Losing La Sasso clearly hurts the Rebels’ chances.
“It’s a blow and we’d be kidding ourselves if we said it wasn’t,” Malloy said. “I mean, we’re losing an NCAA champion and a first team All-American, but we’ve got three other All-Americans sitting in that locker room. We’ve still got firepower. We’ve still got a damned good team, and we’ve got some other guys in that locker room will have a chance to step up and make a difference.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/09150838/Malloy-congratulantes-La-Sasso.-.jpg,,,2026-01-20 15:57:24.571904

(Photo by Diyosa Carter/Getty Images)I joined a virtual book club during the COVID-19 lockdown, and it was a lifeline. It was also the first time I’d ever joined a book club. Odd thing for a book lover/word nerd/writer/librarian to say, but there it is.
Before that, there were kids to raise and a host of other demands or challenges with time. Plus, when time was at a premium, I wanted to read what I wanted to read, and it usually wasn’t what everyone else was reading.
The virtual book club still meets, but the “book” part of the club has all but ceased to be. Now a more accurate description would be: an occasional check-in for the geographically dispersed. Apparently, this happens to some other book clubs, too.
A few months ago, I finally joined an in-person book club. Some members read a lot — I mean, a LOT, and are up on all the latest and hottest authors and titles. I fall asleep while reading, so I am a slacker. They let me join anyway.
Getting hold of the latest and greatest titles, though, has proved to be challenging. Not everyone wants to buy a new book each month or has an Audible subscription. Also, some people prefer to read rather than listen, so an audio book isn’t an attractive option.
No problem, just use interlibrary loan, right? Well, thanks to the dumbness of DOGE (the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency), the Institute for Museum and Library Services’ budget was slashed, and the federal cuts affect state libraries.
State libraries provide funding for interlibrary loan reimbursements and related services, so now, you’ll wait longer for your requests to arrive if you live in Iowa. If you live in South Dakota, well, their state library’s cuts were so severe that they suspended ILL funding entirely.
In an age, when we are deluged by more information than we can possibly read, digest, or critically examine, it’s ironic that obtaining books through libraries is becoming more challenging.
I’m not even talking about the folks who are trying to remove materials from both school and public libraries. You can read the latest from Nicole Baart on the ongoing challenges at the Sioux Center Public Library.
What I’m talking about is access at its most basic level, how books get into people’s hands or in the case of ebooks and audio books, into their devices.
Let’s start with physical books. When a book is published, the copies are typically sent to a wholesale book distributor where bookstores and libraries order copies of new releases.
The largest book distributor in America, Baker & Taylor, recently announced that they are going out of business. Baker & Taylor has been the leader in book distribution for decades and was especially popular with libraries. On the other hand, this news seems like it would be a huge win for its competitor, Ingram.
While Ingram might be happy about increased business, it also requires infrastructure and staffing changes. Stepping into the bigger shoes vacated by B&T is not going to happen overnight. So, there may be a temporary slowdown in book distribution, and libraries and bookstores and their patrons will be inconvenienced.
At this news, some people will certainly say, “Why do we even have libraries anymore? Everything is on the internet.”
“Nobody buys (or needs) physical books anymore.”
“I get all the books I want on my Kindle/phone/iPad.”
But here’s the thing: Not everything is on the internet and not necessarily freely. When it comes to ebooks, you can buy them from the Kindle store and there’s subscription-based Audible for audiobooks. Lucky the person who can buy an electronic book in either form whenever they want.
Barring that, the State Library of Iowa offers electronic books to all Iowa libraries who participate in their Bridges program. Bridges is the name of the program, and Libby is the name of the app that delivers electronic book formats, either as ebooks or audio books.
So, there’s the library, yes. What a lot of people don’t understand is that electronic versions cost a library more than purchasing a physical book, and the library rarely owns said titles. Electronic versions of books are usually leased by contract for specific lengths of time.
If you read the next great American detective mystery on Libby and tell your best friend about it, they may have to wait awhile for their turn. Licensing limits the number of checkouts allowed per title and sometimes the wait list is months long.
I have been on a waiting list behind more than 400 people for an electronic title, telling me I may have to wait 37 weeks. Of course, I gave up and tried interlibrary loan. Most of the time the book will arrive, but not always. I have had requests canceled because too few libraries owned the book or because it was too new to lend to other libraries.
Recently, I requested an ILL for a title that my book club planned to read. I placed the request as soon as we decided on the title, and on the day of our meeting, the book finally arrived. Another member placed an ILL request through another library and still didn’t have the book by the night of the meeting.
And yes, there are libraries that purchase multiple copies of books — book sets — and they will lend these to book clubs, but you have to pick the right book and plan far in advance. A further complication for us, barring the use of book sets, is that our book club members live in different communities and use different libraries. So, not a workable option for us.
Joni Mitchell sang, “You don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone.” But I know what I had when I had it. Easy access. Efficient service. It’s not gone, but it’s fading fast.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-20 20:45:48+00:00,CT Mirror,ICE arrests man inside CT Superior Court building in New Haven,Thomas Breen | New Haven Independent,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/ice-arrests-new-haven-court/,Connecticut law requires judicial marshals to be notified before courthouse arrests by federal agents. The Judicial Branch was not notified.,"At least one masked, armed federal immigration agent ran into the Elm Street courthouse in New Haven on Tuesday morning to arrest a man, potentially in violation of a state law limiting ICE activity on courthouse grounds.
That arrest took place just before 8:55 a.m.
Someone who was in the courthouse at the time and witnessed part of the encounter said that, first, a man ran through the front doors of the 121 Elm St. state court building.
A few seconds later, another man — wearing a mask and a vest and armed with a gun — sprinted after him, running past the court entryway’s metal detector.
A video recording of part of that incident shows that the masked, armed man’s vest bore the words “Police” and “Homeland Security Investigations,” which is a division of the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. The video also later shows two agents — including the one in the “Homeland Security Investigations” vest — taking a man into custody outside of the court’s front door.
“We can confirm that ICE arrested an individual in the New Haven GA Courthouse this morning,” said Rhonda Hebert, a spokesperson for the Connecticut Judicial Branch. “The Judicial Branch did not receive any prior notification from ICE regarding the arrest.”
Police spokesperson Officer Christian Bruckhart confirmed that an ICE arrest occurred near the courthouse Tuesday morning. He wasn’t able to say whether the arrest occurred inside or outside the building.
An ICE spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about who was arrested on Tuesday and why.
ICE agents have popped up downtown with increasing frequency in recent months, usually to make arrests of undocumented immigrants who have shown up for criminal court hearings — a method of immigration enforcement that advocates warn will discourage migrants from showing up to court or reporting crimes to the police.
Those previous local ICE arrests have typically taken place outside of the courthouse — on the sidewalk on Elm Street, or even on the Green.
Tuesday’s arrest, meanwhile, appears to have taken place inside the courthouse itself.
That could be a violation of a law passed by the state legislature in November with the goal of limiting ICE enforcement in or near courthouses. One part of that bill prohibits law enforcement officers from wearing masks “while on courthouse grounds,” unless they’ve received prior authorization from a judicial authority and it’s medically necessary.
“Ensuring that all residents feel safe coming into courthouses and participating in our judicial system is essential to keeping all Connecticut families safe. That’s why the state passed restrictions on ICE activity [and] masked agents in courthouses,” New Haven State Rep. Steve Winter told the Independent in an interview Tuesday.
He said that one of the top concerns he hears from constituents is about “the idea of masked federal agents terrorizing community members.”
“We need to keep ICE out of our courthouses,” Winter said. “That’s what will keep our communities safe, and not these aggressive tactics” that ICE is using in the name of public safety.

House Majority Leader Rep. Jason Monks, R-Meridian, introduced the bill in the House Revenue and Taxation Committee. The proposed legislation would increase the limits on the State Taxation Anticipated Revenue, or STARS, program.

The program allows for developers to receive a rebate of sales taxes collected by the retailers within the complex to reimburse 60% of expenses related to certain transportation projects, such as highway improvements or the installation of an interchange. 
The minimum cost of a project to enter the program is currently $6 million, and the proposed bill would increase this to $10 million. The maximum total reimbursement per project is currently $35 million, the bill would increase it to $100 million. 
Monks said the change was to keep up with the rising costs to do these projects. He said it acts like an “interest-free loan” for the state, as the developer fronts the cost for the highway projects that benefit the state. 
He emphasized that the program doesn’t use existing sales tax revenue, only the future revenue from the retailers.  
“We would never receive (that revenue) had the project not moved forward, or had to put the money in for that infrastructure ahead of time anyway,” he said.
House Assistant Minority Leader Rep. Steve Berch, D-Boise, said he’d vote to introduce the bill, but had concerns about potentially limiting the state’s future revenue. 
The committee unanimously voted to introduce the legislation, which will allow it to come back for a full public hearing.

According to an FWP press release, officials received a mortality signal from a wolf collar in the Jardine area late last month. They found the collar had been cut off the animal and thrown into a tree, but did not find a wolf carcass.
Montana’s wolf hunting season has been open since September, with a statewide quota of 452 wolves to be hunted and trapped through mid-March. In addition to the statewide quota, there is a three-wolf quota for each of two wolf management units just north of Yellowstone National Park.
The wolf collar was located in wolf management unit 313, which closed to hunting and trapping on Nov. 16 after hunters killed three wolves and met the localized quota.
Game wardens believe the collared wolf was killed around 10 p.m. on Christmas Day.

Newly filed political finance records show that all $1.55 million raised by the controversial ballot question campaign in its first few months came from SAM Action Inc., a national dark-money group that opposes legal drug use but is not required to disclose the source of its own funding. 
It’s the same organization that bankrolled opposition to a 2024 Massachusetts ballot question that sought to open up access to some psychedelic substances, which voters rejected. 
Massachusetts is not alone as a battleground, either. SAM Action is also the only donor behind a ballot question in Maine this cycle that would similarly prohibit recreational pot use there, as the Portland Press Herald reported. 
Both campaigns have generated scrutiny over their efforts to gather signatures from voters. 
In Massachusetts, opponents filed an objection alleging the campaign “obtained signatures fraudulently” by telling voters the measure would provide affordable housing or fund public parks, not that it would ban recreational marijuana. 
The State Ballot Law Commission heard arguments last week and is expected to rule by Friday. State law empowers the panel to determine whether signatures were placed on a ballot question petition “by fraud,” and its interpretation could set off a lengthier court battle over whether the question can go before voters. 
Similarly, Mainers have been alleging in recent weeks that they were misled about what the anti-marijuana petition would do when they signed it. Maine’s secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, said she’s received complaints about the topic, adding that she has no enforcement power because, as she put it to lawmakers, “You have a right to lie under the First Amendment.” 
Wendy Wakeman, a veteran Republican operative who is working as spokesperson for the repeal campaign, said the Massachusetts and Maine questions are “not a coordinated effort” despite funding coming from the same national group.  
SAM Action is a 501(c)(4) organization, so its donors are private, leaving unclear exactly who is putting major dollars toward shutting down an industry both Massachusetts and Maine voted nearly a decade ago to legalize. 
On its website, SAM Action claims affiliation with the nonprofit Smart Approaches to Marijuana group co-founded by former US Rep. Patrick Kennedy — a Democrat who represented Rhode Island, and the son of longtime US Sen. Ted Kennedy — along with former White House Office of National Drug Control Policy advisor Kevin Sabet and David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush who is now a senior editor at The Atlantic. 
Wakeman declined to comment on SAM Action’s primary donors. 
“Massachusetts is in the minority of states in the United States in which marijuana is available recreationally,” she told CommonWealth Beacon. “It should be unsurprising that national groups with health concerns are interested in helping Massachusetts craft better, safer marijuana laws.” 
While marijuana remains illegal under federal law, 24 states, two territories, and Washington, DC, allow recreational marijuana use by adults, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Several others decriminalized the drug without fully legalizing personal, non-medical use.  
President Trump last year also signed an executive order reclassifying marijuana as a drug with less potential for harm and dependence, signaling a softer position. SAM opposed that move. 
Voters in the Bay State approved recreational marijuana use in 2016 by a margin of 54 percent to 46 percent. Since then, the industry has generated more than $8 billion in sales. 
The proposed ballot question would undo legalization of recreational pot use. It would leave the medical marijuana industry in place, but expand civil penalties for public possession above one ounce. 
The campaign committee working on the anti-recreational marijuana question in Massachusetts spent about $1.4 million in 2025, the vast majority of which went toward paid signature-gathering in an attempt to secure a spot on the 2026 ballot.  
Each campaign needed to collect at least 74,574 signatures from registered Massachusetts voters to clear an early hurdle en route to the 2026 ballot. Organizers will need another, smaller round of signatures later this year to lock in their spots. 
All ballot question campaigns must file 2025 year-end financial reports by the end of the day Tuesday. Several others have already disclosed significant fundraising and spending, with most of the money similarly going toward the arduous effort of gathering enough voter signatures. 
Under state law, the campaigns do not need to submit their next financial disclosures until September, keeping most of the fundraising and spending obscured from public view until close to the election. 
The Senate last week approved legislation that would require ballot question campaign committees to file financial reports at least monthly in election years. It’s not clear if or when the House will take up the measure.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_0419.jpg?fit=640%2C480&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-20 15:57:24.571904

Phil Murphy.,"Darren Boykins sits with his mother, Carmella Bowers, during a prison visit, not long after he was convicted for the 1981 murder of Milton Laufer in Newark. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Darren Boykins has been in prison for 45 years despite being eligible for parole for nearly half that time — and despite his steadfast claim that he did not commit the 1981 murder that landed him behind bars.
Tuesday, he learned he’ll finally be free, after outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy commuted his sentence six weeks before his next parole eligibility date.
Boykins was one of 148 people Murphy granted clemency to on Tuesday morning in his final hours in office before the inauguration of New Jersey’s new governor, Mikie Sherrill.
Gov. Murphy vetoes immigrant protection bills, angering activists

His lawyer, John Crayton, has fought since 2024 to exonerate him and applauded the commutation while also vowing to continue his fight to prove Boykins was wrongfully convicted.
“This is not a happy ending. It’s just the next step. And it’s probably, hopefully, a much better place for Darren,” Crayton said. “I am determined to get the state of New Jersey to admit to their injustice 45 years ago. This should never have happened to him.”
Boykins was 19 when he was arrested in the May 22, 1981, slaying of carpet salesman Milton Laufer. He always insisted he was innocent and had an alibi the day of the murder. Investigators never found a murder weapon, and two witnesses repeatedly could not identify him as the killer. But jurors convicted him largely on the word of a jailhouse informant who later recanted.
Crayton found that authorities failed to divulge exculpatory evidence that could have cleared Boykins of suspicion and organized a photo lineup 39 days after the homicide that Crayton contends was improper. They also covered up or dismissed evidence that could have freed Boykins from jail in his post-conviction appeals and parole bids, Crayton said in a November court petition.
Boykins is now 64 and under psychiatric care at the New Jersey State Prison in Trenton. He’s expected to be released in the coming days to a program for parolees run by Volunteers of America Delaware Valley.
“I’m worried that he’s going to be in a place that he’s unfamiliar with, and he’ll be afraid,” Crayton said. “In any event, he’s going to be out of prison, and that’s a good thing. He’ll get to see his mother and brother and sisters, and that’s a good thing. He will be moving in a better direction for himself and for his family.”
With Tuesday’s clemencies, Murphy has pardoned or shortened the prison or parole sentences of 455 people in seven rounds of clemency actions since December 2024 — the most of all New Jersey governors combined over the past three decades.
Murphy said, though, that his clemency initiative “was never about numbers — it was about people.”

“Each pardon and commutation represents a story of accountability, growth, and redemption,” he said in a statement. “From the outset, we have been guided by a fundamental belief that mercy and fairness are essential to a system that truly serves everyone. By offering second chances to individuals who have demonstrated rehabilitation and a commitment to their communities, we have strengthened not only individual lives, but our entire state.”
More than 4,500 people have applied for clemency consideration since Murphy created a clemency advisory board in June 2024 to review their cases and recommend candidates for commutations and pardons.
Murphy and the board expedited applications from people convicted of non-violent offenses, domestic violence survivors whose offenses were connected to their victimization, and cases involving excessive trial penalties (where people got lengthier sentences at trial than what they were offered to plead guilty pre-trial). The approach was meant to make “fairness and not favor” the barometer for who gets clemency, they have said.
Still, several of the 97 pardons and 51 commutations announced Tuesday raised eyebrows, given the political connections of those awarded pardons or commutations.
They included Harris Jacobs, 28, an Atlantic City man accused of a fatal 2022 hit-and-run that left a pedestrian dead. Jacobs’ attorney told BreakingAC that he learned of his pardon even before jurors convicted him on Tuesday. Jacobs’ father, Joe Jacobs, is an attorney active in Democratic politics in Atlantic City.
Also pardoned was former Assemblyman Al Coutinho, an Essex County Democrat who was sentenced to three years of probation in 2013 after admitting he took money intended for his family’s charitable foundation.
Another clemency recipient was Mordechai Berkowitz, 24, of Lakewood, who prosecutors said had been speeding with a blood-alcohol content nearly twice the legal limit when he crashed into another car in 2022, killing a woman and seriously injuring another. A judge sentenced Berkowitz in December to six years in prison under the state No Early Release Act, but Murphy on Tuesday commuted his sentence so that he’ll be freed early in 2028 and on parole for three years afterward. His attorney is Lee Vartan, a former federal prosecutor whom Murphy in 2022 considered to become attorney general. Vartan also was second in command of New Jersey’s attorney general’s office during the Christie administration.
Others granted clemency are sure to stir controversy.

Joseph Grieco, a former Tenafly cop, had been sentenced last year to 11 years behind bars for fatally shooting his husband, John Kelly, a former New York City cop, in 2023 after a night of drinking. Murphy commuted his sentence, so that Grieco will be freed in 2029 and serve three years on parole after.
Michael Sica was president of a police union when he was sentenced to seven years for official misconduct, conspiracy, and related charges stemming from a cover-up prosecutors said he coordinated after Union County Jail guards beat immigrants detained there in 1995.
Other clemency recipients had convictions for offenses ranging from shoplifting and drug crimes that have since been decriminalized to murder and other felonies. Many had served lengthy prison and parole sentences.
Edwin “Chino” Ortiz and his brother Carmelo Ortiz were among those pardoned. The siblings were released from prison in 2016 after serving 30 years for a fatal robbery. In 2021, they founded the Newark-based Returning Citizens Support Group to help other people better reintegrate after leaving prison.
Since then, Chino Ortiz has become an advocate for better reentry policies, testifying for prison reforms at the Statehouse and calling for voting and jury service rights to be restored for people with criminal convictions.
Clemency removes reentry hurdles, such as employers and landlords denying people jobs and housing because of their past mistakes, he said.
“Many men and women that are coming home from incarceration are still facing discrimination because of their criminal background,” Chino Ortiz said. “It’s not fair for me and other people who have convictions not to be seen as every other citizen, especially after paying my debt to society and living productively. I can’t find the words to express how it feels to be given a second chance. It’s just really a great feeling.”

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach will pay a symbolic $1 sanction because he “should have known” better than to file a motion in a court that did not have jurisdiction.
Kobach, along with his solicitor general, Anthony Powell, was admonished and fined by District Judge Thomas Luedke in a long-running case regarding gender marker changes on driver’s licenses. 
Kobach filed the case in Shawnee County District Court in 2023 against David Harper, director of the Kansas Division of Vehicles, demanding that his division stop allowing gender changes on driver’s licenses. Harper has since retired from the position, and the current director is Deann Williams.
The case reached the Kansas Court of Appeals, which ruled against Kobach in finding there was no harm to allowing people to change their gender markers. In October, Kobach and Powell filed a motion once more in the district court, asking the division of vehicles to maintain a list of gender changes made on driver’s licenses. 
The state noted the division already maintains such a list – rendering the request “completely unnecessary.”
“Respondents seek sanctions against Petitioners contending that the motion was presented for an improper purpose, needlessly increased the cost of litigation, was contrary to the law, and essentially requested the Court disregard the mandate” of the Kansas Court of Appeals, the Division of Vehicles court filing said. 
The state asked the court to dismiss the motion, which violated three different legal principles. The court dismissed the motion and sanctioned Kobach and Powell for “filing a motion that they knew, or should have known, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider.”
Rep. John Carmichael, D-Wichita, said the handling of this lawsuit was another example of Kobach’s ineptitude. 
“I am getting tired of reading orders, opinions, rulings, etc., that continue to point out that our attorney general is wrong on the facts, wrong on the law and doesn’t seem to recognize it,” he said. “I don’t know what it’s going to take. Judge (Julie) Robinson ordered the attorney general to take remedial, basic legal classes because he didn’t understand the rules of evidence in her court.”
Carmichael was referring to a high-profile federal court case in 2018, when Robinson found Kobach in contempt and struck down his signature law that required new voters to prove their citizenship.
Kobach consistently engages in “bad lawyering,” as shown by judges who have sanctioned him, Carmichael said. He also noted Kobach in the House Judiciary Committee last week “flat out misrepresents the holding of the Court of Appeals.”
“He impugns then-Chief Judge (Karen) Arnold-Burger’s opinion in the case, suggesting that the court ignored his evidence, when in fact, that is simply not true,” Carmichael said. “In the case in the court of appeals, the court went through witness by witness, describing why the attorney general had once again engaged in bad lawyering and failed to prove his case.”
In a news conference on the first day of the legislative session, House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, D-Lenexa, also questioned Kobach’s approach on the gender markers court case. 
“The Republicans can’t even define what ‘diversity, equity and inclusion’ is across the state, so a legal, statutory definition is probably where they should start when it comes to the gender markers,” he said. “Once again, Kris Kobach has lost in court and is asking the Legislature to clean up his mess.”
Danedri Herbert, Kobach’s spokeswoman, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the judge’s sanction.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA010120-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-20 15:57:24.571904

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Days after news leaked of a criminal investigation of Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey over their handling of immigration enforcement in Minnesota, the U.S. Department of Justice has delivered subpoenas to the offices of Walz and Frey, as well as St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty.
The New York Times first reported the delivery of the subpoenas, and other national outlets also confirmed that reporting.
The subpoenas are an extraordinary escalation of the ongoing conflict between the Trump administration and Minnesota, where heavily-armed, masked federal agents now outnumber all the metro police departments combined, frequently using tactics a federal judge has called unconstitutional.
When the investigation became public last week, Walz replied in a statement: “Two days ago it was Elissa Slotkin. Last week it was Jerome Powell. Before that, Mark Kelly,” he said, referring to the U.S. senators who made a video telling U.S. servicemembers that they can and must refuse illegal orders, as well as the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who has refused to lower interest rates as quickly as Trump desires. “Weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic,” Walz said.
Ellison, who’s sued the Trump administration more than 30 times in the past year, said the investigation is being used to distract: “Instead of seriously investigating the killing of Renee Good, Trump is weaponizing the justice system against any leader who dares stand up to him,” referring to the Minneapolis woman shot by federal officer Jonathan Ross earlier this month. “Donald Trump is coming after the people of Minnesota and I’m standing in his way. I will not be intimidated and I will not stop working to protect Minnesotans from Trump’s campaign of retaliation and revenge,” Ellison said.
Frey called the investigation “an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, our local law enforcement and our residents against the chaos and danger this administration has brought to our streets.”
He added: “I will not be intimidated.”
Her, whose tenure as St. Paul mayor began earlier this month, said in a statement that Trump “promised retribution, and consistent with that promise, we received a subpoena today from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. I am unfazed by these tactics, and I stand firm in my commitment to protect our residents, neighbors and community.”
The Washington Post reported that “the subpoenas suggest that the Justice Department is examining whether Walz’s and Frey’s public statements disparaging the surge of officers and federal actions have amounted to criminal interference in law enforcement work.”
Walz, who announced earlier this month he won’t seek a third term, also used his statement last week to criticize the federal government for not properly investigating the killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross. “The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her,” he said.
Six prosecutors in the Minnesota Office of U.S. Attorney quit last week, The New York Times reported, because they objected to their bosses’ push to investigate the widow of Good and their ties to anti-ICE groups.
The ICE surge, which has put as many as 3,000 federal agents in the state — or nearly five times the number of sworn officers with the Minneapolis Police Department — is just the latest round of an ongoing conflict between Minnesota and the federal government. Fraud in Minnesota’s social programs — often funded in whole or part by the federal government — has caught the attention of right-wing media and activists, and the Trump administration has followed with a wide array of investigations of Minnesota programs across a range of agencies.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is auditing Hennepin Healthcare — Minnesota’s largest safety net hospital — for compliance with immigrant employment eligibility laws.
The Trump administration has frozen child care payments and halted small business grants. The administration also says it’s investigating possible housing assistance fraud and looking into Minnesota’s unemployment insurance program. The federal government has also attempted to withhold funds to Minnesota for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, but a federal court issued a preliminary injunction.
Earlier this week, Trump said he would cut all federal funding to Minnesota and other states that have sanctuary cities beginning Feb. 1, but it’s unclear what that means and few details have been released.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MG_8042-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 15:57:24.571904

Democrats plan to prioritize affordability, voting access and reducing gun violence. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Alabama House Democrats said on Tuesday that they will prioritize affordability issues for the coming session in response to the tariffs and cuts to federal food and health care programs.
Democratic leadership also said they will focus on making it easier for farmers to sell their commodities directly to consumers; making it easier to vote addressing gun violence that continues to plague the state, particularly in the larger urban areas.
“We have always talked about affordability, it is just this year we are squarely focusing on affordability because the timing is right,” said House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels, D-Huntsville. “Every time we build an agenda, we do a needs assessment of the state, and we develop the agenda based upon that.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Democrats only hold 29 seats in the 105-member House and have limited ability to influence overall legislative priorities. But House Democrats are hoping to respond to the affordability issues through different economic mechanisms. Among them is to introduce legislation to make it easier for farmers to sell their goods to consumers.
“Our approach now is going to be focusing primarily on how we increase the production from our local farmers throughout the state, what do those investments need to look like, how do we get our grocery stores and other vendors to be able to buy from local farmers,” Daniels said.
Daniels also criticized cuts made in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump last summer, to health insurance and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
“People are hurting because of the cuts at the federal level as a result of the ‘Not So Beautiful Bill,’” Daniels said at the news conference. “Looking at the funding from a health care standpoint, we are getting $203 million, whereas during the Cares Act, we had significantly more money to distribute across the state of Alabama.”
Daniels acknowledged the Legislature’s past efforts to reduce the state grocery tax by half, going from 4 cents to 2 cents, but said that difference is miniscule compared to the impact that inflation has had in recent years.
House Democrats extended the affordability theme to voter access.
“When we talk about voting rights and fair district maps, can we afford to make it harder for eligible citizens to vote?” said Rep. Adline Clarke, D-Mobile. “Can we afford politically gerrymandered district maps in which politicians pick their voters instead of voters having the right to pick the candidates of their choice?”
Alabama has already had to redraw its congressional districts in the wake of the Milligan case. In a separate case, a judge ordered a redrawing of the state Senate map.
HB 45, sponsored by Clarke, allows a person who wants to vote by absentee ballot to designate another individual to deliver the absentee ballot application and the ballot to the election manager.
Clarke, along with Rep. Thomas Jackson, D-Thomasville, filed HB 270, to allow early voting in Alabama to boost voter participation rate in the state. Voter participation in the 2024 presidential election in Alabama was  58.5%, the lowest since 1988.
Finally, House leadership said it wants to reduce gun violence that has plagued Alabama and tied it to allowing permitless carry in the state.
“What is it going to take before we address this crisis?” said Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile. “We can’t afford to lose more children due to the overwhelming amount of guns that are on our street.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260120_110734-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-20 15:57:24.571904

(Photo by Vladimir Vladimirov/Getty Images)Florida doctors, school counselors, or psychologists could face third-degree felony charges and $100,000 in fines if they advise minors to undergo transgender therapies under a bill that cleared its first committee Tuesday.
Passing with just one “no” vote, SB 1010 would punish providers who “aid and abet” minors in receiving transitioning procedures and empower the attorney general to investigate alleged violations. The bill would expand a 2023 law that outlawed any surgeries, medications, or other procedures allowing children to transition their genders.
“The intent of this bill is to continue to protect the children of Florida and hold bad actors accountable,” bill sponsor Sen. Clay Yarborough, a Jacksonville Republican, said before the Committee on Children, Families, and Elder Affairs. Yarborough had carried the 2023 law.
The political discussion surrounding medical care for transgender Americans has dominated culture issues nationwide. Arkansas was the first state to ban minors from accessing gender therapies in 2021, precipitating a trend that spread to other red states like Alabama and Florida.
And while Florida wasn’t first on that legislation, Gov. Ron DeSantis, in advance of his 2024 presidential bid, led the nation in carving out “anti-woke” policies and culture war crusades. This included a ban on transwoman athletes competing in women’s sports, elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in higher education, and outlawing discussions of sexual identity in K-8 classrooms.
These cultural issues largely tapered off after the governor dropped out of the presidential race and amid an increasingly rebellious Republican Legislature, which somewhat slipped out of DeSantis’ grasp during the 2025 legislative session.
But that doesn’t mean all social issues are gone from the Legislature.
‘Great deal of concern’
Under the bill, a health care practitioner who “aids or abets” another in prescribing or assisting a minor in sex-reassignment procedures commits a third-degree felony, punishable by up to 5 years in prison. Additionally, the attorney general could investigate and seek up to $100,000 per violation from offenders. That money would go to the child who received treatment.
The bill provides for a private cause of action against a state or local government employee who violates Florida’s “Parents’ Bill of Rights,” which guarantees parents the right to direct the upbringing, education, health care, and mental health care of their children. Similarly, the AG could seek civil penalties up to $100,000 per violation to be paid to the minor.
Although Yarborough emphasized that his measure attempts to create greater enforcement actions and to close loopholes in the 2023 law, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers raised concerns that the bill may be too broad, and could result in punishing teachers for simply having a discussion with a child considering confirming his or her gender identity.
“I hope we can clarify that … a simple conversation, coming to someone with a problem asking for help, does not move to the level that you wind up liable for advising a student,” said Republican Sen. Gayle Harrell of Stuart. She ultimately voted for the bill, but cautioned that doesn’t mean she’ll continue to do so.
“I will work with you, but I have a great deal of concern with it,” she added.
SB 1010 would expand upon the 2023 law, which allows for third-degree felony charges against a doctor who prescribes gender transitioning medications or performs transitioning surgeries on a minor.
Florida was one of a handful of states that faced constitutional challenges to laws like this, and initially had its enforcement paused because of federal trial court rulings.
However, a federal appeals court stayed the lower courts’ injunctions. In a similar vein, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s ban on prescribing puberty blockers and hormone therapy for treatment of gender dysphoria to minors.
The House version of the bill also passed its first committee Tuesday in a party-line vote. Both bills have two more committee stops before a floor vote.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1323919275-scaled-1-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2026-01-20 15:57:24.571904

Michelle Lujan Grisham's last chance to codify her climate goals.,"A pumpjack operates north of Carlsbad, NM. (Photo by Jerry Redfern/Capital & Main)
New Mexico’s 2026 legislative session marks the last chance for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s policy initiatives to become law while she’s still in office: Her term-limited tenure winds up at the end of the year. Meanwhile, the session begins, as ever, with concerns over revenue from the state’s biggest private-sector funder, the oil and gas industry.
Booming oil production in New Mexico’s portion of the Permian Basin has driven state budgets to record highs in recent years. But in 2025, the state’s oil production rose only slightly while crude oil prices dropped dramatically — down roughly 25% since President Donald Trump returned to office last January.
In its December revenue report, state economists with the Legislative Finance Committee said, The state’s “current price softness now outweighs production growth as the dominant downward influence on revenue projections.” Put plainly, slower production increases coupled with much lower oil prices will lead to a shallower growth curve in future revenues for the state.

Even if it’s slowing, that production still creates a lot of pollution. Lujan Grisham’s third executive order upon taking office in 2019 was to set the state on a path to a 45% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Despite repeated attempts in the Legislature, that goal has not yet been codified in law.
Meanwhile, the state’s Climate Action Plan released last month upped the challenge, angling for an 82% reduction by 2050, with carbon offsets covering the remainder to achieve net zero emissions.
Carbon offsets — in which a company reduces or removes carbon from the environment in one place to offset emissions elsewhere — may be the controversial change that finally gets the governor’s 2019 policy over the line and signed into law.
“This is the session to pass comprehensive climate legislation,” said Camilla Feibelman, director of the Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter.
Last year’s Clear Horizons & Greenhouse Gas Emissions Act was the latest attempt to codify Lujan Grisham’s executive order. All attempts have died, with last year’s effort being voted down when two Democrats — Sens. Benny Shendo (D-Jemez Pueblo) and George Muñoz (D-Gallup) — joined all Republicans in a Senate committee hearing to kill it.
Like earlier versions, it called for direct reduction and removal of greenhouse gases at their sources. That requirement met stiff opposition from the oil and gas industry, which would have to dramatically reduce leaks, venting and flaring across the board. The act died following an ad campaign by the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association decrying the bill and the bill’s main sponsor, Sen. Mimi Stewart (D-Bernalillo), who is also president pro tempore of the Senate.
Stewart again is the main sponsor of a new version of the Clear Horizons & Greenhouse Gas Emissions Act, this year’s attempt to cement the governor’s executive order into law. But the senator’s bill has changed over the past 12 months. She described its main points in a phone call, since it had not been filed as of publication.
“Overall, the bill is shorter and leaner,” she said. In addition, it specifically exempts people or businesses emitting less than 10,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases annually. Earlier versions of the bill “never attempted to scoop in those small emitters,” Stewart said, and the explicit carve-out should make it more palatable to more legislators.
The biggest change comes in how reductions can be counted. The new bill would allow certified reductions through carbon offsets as opposed to direct reductions at the point of pollution. Stewart said offsets could include soil and agriculture improvements or carbon capture projects. She stipulated that the offsets “have to be in New Mexico, and they have to be real, permanent, quantifiable, verifiable and enforceable.”
Stewart added: “The certification process will be in-house, will be in state” and will be conducted by the New Mexico Environment Department.
“We’re not going to farm this out to a bogus certification company,” she said.
She said the change adding offsets emerged after meetings with small and large oil and gas producers, including EOG Resources Inc., Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips Co. Stewart said the Chevron representative was Patrick Killen, a registered lobbyist who for the past few election cycles has been the largest single contributor to New Mexico politicians — more than $2.3 million between 2021 and 2025 — on behalf of his employer, according to state campaign finance records. He did not respond to requests for comment.
Stewart said she did not meet with the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association. “That was not very helpful last year,” she said. “It’s much better to actually meet with the oil and gas industry themselves.”
Asked about the return of the bill, Missi Currier, president and CEO of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, said only, “If [it is] filed, NMOGA will request feedback from membership to determine a position on the bill.”
Michael Coleman, director of communications for Lujan Grisham, said, “The governor is interested in all technologies that can help reduce our carbon footprint, and she appreciates [Stewart’s] work to provide options for companies doing business and technology development in the state.”
For years now globally, carbon offsets have been a controversial form of greenhouse emission reduction that often don’t meet stated goals and have been tainted by allegations of fraud. Industrial-scale carbon capture and sequestration projects also have a checkered history of not meeting either budgetary or sequestration goals.
Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, executive director of the nonprofit Western Environmental Law Center, said that his group will not take a position on the bill until it is publicly filed. But, he said, “Offsets are fraught with peril and deeply problematic.” He pointed to the history of verification problems associated with them and added, “We also don’t like them because the fossil fuel industry uses them to greenwash their operations.”
However, the offsets may be “a necessary concession to secure buy-in from certain industry-friendly legislators,” he said.
“I do understand the political logic,” Schlenker-Goodrich said. “The question is whether the logic works.”
If the bill passes this session, it would require implementation rules to be drawn up and approved by the Environment Department’s Environmental Improvement Board.
Schlenker-Goodrich said the new rules wouldn’t be “a guarantee of success by any means, but it does provide some assurance that the bill would be implemented in a pragmatic and effective manner.” There will be “lots of angels and devils in the details,” he said.
“Offsets can mean a lot of different things, and with strong, technical rulemaking I think we can avoid the worst,” Feibelman said.
The new Clear Horizons Act isn’t the only climate- and oil-and-gas-related bill that will be debated this session. Stewart said she will propose a big bump in tax credits for new solar installations, increasing the current 10% state tax credit to 30% to make up for the loss of a federal 30% credit that was killed by the Trump administration.
The New Mexico Oil and Gas Association is also looking forward to some legislation. Last session, regular public comments called for the industry to clean up abandoned well sites and other infrastructure. Republican legislators pushed back, arguing that money from the state Reclamation Fund — the purpose of which is, in part, to pay those costs — was siphoned off to pay for items in the state’s general budget.
Reporting last year by Capital & Main highlighted how oil and gas producers can fail, leaving behind unplugged wells and leaking equipment to degrade in New Mexico’s high desert climate. Depending on the size of the failure, a cleanup can cost state and federal agencies millions. A report published last summer by the Legislative Finance Committee warned that the state could be responsible for $700 million to $1.6 billion in cleanup costs in coming years. In April last year, the Reclamation Fund had $66.7 million, its highest balance ever, according to the report.
Currier and others want to update the fund to make sure more of that money goes toward oil and gas field cleanup.
“The Reclamation Fund, funded exclusively by the oil and gas industry, is the state’s best and most underutilized resource to ensure our lands are returned to their native state safely and efficiently,” she said.
*   *   *
Last year’s legislative session ended in March with four huge numbers:

$10.8 billion.
$10 billion.
$400 million.
$300 million.

The first figure is the total state budget passed by the Legislature in 2025 — a record.
The second is the amount Rep. Derrick J. Lente (D-Sandia Pueblo) claimed oil and gas companies made in profits in New Mexico in 2024. He brought this up during a committee hearing as an argument in favor of an increase in oil taxes so they would match the tax paid on natural gas extracted in the state.
The third is the amount that the proposed oil tax increase could have added to state coffers this year had it passed in its original form, according to the Legislative Finance Committee. That proposal, following several debates, shrinkage and its addition to another tax bill, eventually died.
And the last number is the amount that the Rio Grande Chapter of the Sierra Club tallied as money spent on climate change mitigation and economic programs in the state’s final budget last year.
It’s unclear if the oil tax change will reappear at this session. Its sponsors, Reps. Nathan Small (D-Doña Ana) and Meredith Dixon (D-Bernalillo), did not respond to requests for comment.
It is clear that New Mexico faces another warm and dry winter. “This winter has just been the epitome of what a climate change winter is,” said Feibelman, the Sierra Club director. “There is no explanation for what’s going on except for climate change”
December 2025 was the warmest December on record for many towns and cities in New Mexico. The year was the fourth-warmest on record for the country and the third-warmest for the planet.

Michelle Lujan Grisham’s last in office. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)A New Mexico House Republican leader said at a news conference at the beginning of the 30-day legislative session that Republicans have become “unlikely allies” with Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on issues like crime and health care as she heads into her final year in office.
State Rep. Rebecca Dow (R-Truth or Consequences) reflected at a Roundhouse news conference Tuesday on how the relationship between House Republicans and the governor has changed since Lujan Grisham took office in 2019. She said the GOP and Lujan Grisham have found themselves aligning more lately due to what she described as a progressive shift in the majority Democratic Legislature.
“The governor’s door is open, and especially for Republicans, around the issues that the progressive majority refused to move on,” Dow said. “And that has been around reforms with crime and the health care crisis that we’re facing in New Mexico.”
In addition to passing a budget during the 30-day session, Lujan Grisham is expected to put other items on the agenda for lawmakers that Republicans said Tuesday they’ve spent years advocating for, including juvenile criminal justice reform and health care changes. 
New Mexico 2026 legislative session kicks off Tuesday

“We’ve become unlikely allies,” Dow said. “And I think it’s an indication of how misaligned this legislative body is with the people they’re supposed to represent.”
Dow’s comments came ahead of Lujan Grisham’s final State of the State address as governor on the opening day of a packed legislative session. The governor is urging the Legislature to change the state’s criminal code regarding juvenile offenders, as well as address a state doctor shortage through interstate medical compacts and medical malpractice reforms. 
When it comes to criminal justice reform, the governor relied on Republicans to introduce a host of bills legislation during a special legislative session in July 2024 that ended in just five hours after Democrats in the majority refused to take up the bills. The governor has continued calling on Democrats to do more regarding criminal justice since then, including at the end of the legislative session last year. 
The governor also agreed to put medical reforms on the agenda for the session, which House Republicans said Tuesday was a result of pressure from them and the public at large. Senate Democrats, who previously stymied efforts to enter the medical compacts, announced recently that they expect to enter two such compacts for doctors and social workers this session.
However, House Democrats and House Republicans are urging the Legislature to enter more of them this session. Rep. Gail Armstrong (R-Magdalena) said at the news conference that she expects the governor to join the House in pressuring the Senate to pass more compacts than just the two. 
“So the pressure’s there. New Mexico wants these compacts. Is the legislature willing to do it?” she said. “We in the House of Representatives — Republicans — we’re ready to do it.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_3920-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 14:57:20.060499

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)A measure (SB 484) revising state law regarding regulation of large-scale data centers and certain other large electricity users received its first hearing in a legislative committee in Tallahassee on Tuesday.
The proposal, introduced by Sen. Bryan Avila, R-Miami Springs, is the first bill in the Florida Legislature to address concerns about the intense energy demand by Artificial Intelligence (AI) data centers.
Data centers’ projected electricity demand in 2030 has been set at to up to 130 gigawatts, which would represent close to 12% of total U.S. annual demand, according to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute.
Avila’s bill would require the Public Service Commission (PSC) to develop minimum large load tariff requirements for public electric utilities to reasonably ensure that big customers (such as large data centers) pay for their own cost of service and that the general body of ratepayers do not bear the risk of non-payment of such costs.
It specifies that agencies may not enter into non-disclosure agreements or other contract language restricting disclosure of information about a potential data center development to the public.
And it continues to maintains authority of local governments to exercise their powers of comprehensive planning and land development regulations granted by law with respect to large-load customers.
The proposal was greeted favorably by representatives of consumer advocacy groups.
“We have nearly 150,000 members across the state, and we’re very concerned about undue burdens on them as ratepayers,” said Heaven Campbell, Florida director of Solar United Neighbors (SUN) Action. “I believe that we have to figure this out before the damage is done.”
However, some organizations believe the measure goes too far in regulating the emerging industry.
“Florida can either welcome billions in capital investment into high-wage jobs and substantial tax revenue, or we can erect barriers that send these projects to Texas, Georgia, and North Carolina,” warned Turner Loesel, a policy analyst with the James Madison Institute. 
His organization believes ratepayer protections “matter,” he said, but contended that several provisions in the bill go “beyond consumer protections” and threaten to place Florida behind other states in competition for such projects.
“Other states are rolling out the red carpet, while we roll out the red tape,” he said.
FOMO
Sen. Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford, said he appreciated parts of the bill that would protect local governments when it comes to water use, but argued the Legislature must encourage data centers to be located in Florida.
“It’s not like we can say, ‘We don’t like this.’ This will go to Georgia, and we will never recover,” he warned — adding that with the state’s military bases and university system, “there are umpteen uses for having these centers located in Florida.”
The measure ultimately passed unanimously in the Senate Regulated Industries Committee.
A related measure (SB 1118), which would provide an exemption from public records disclosure for information relating to the plans, intentions, or interest of a person to locate a data center for 12 months, also was approved, though Sen. Jason Pizzo, independent from Sunny Isles Beach, voted no.
“This really, really puts local officials in a tough spot about what they are and are not allowed to say and talk about,” he said.
Committee Chair Jennifer Bradley, R-Fleming Island, said she agreed with Sen. Pizzo’s remarks but opted to support the bill at its first committee stop. “I do think these provisions are a little broad in terms of for local governments,” she said.
Avila vowed to work on tightening the language as the bill advances through committees. It would become law on the same day that SB 484 would take effect, which would be July 1, 2026.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/data-centers-VA.jpg,,,2026-01-20 14:57:20.060499
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-20 19:45:27+00:00,CT Mirror,CT correction ombuds details ‘institutional failure’ in prison conditions report,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/conditions-of-confinement-report-correction-ombuds-ct/,"The 2025 Conditions of Confinement report examined several aspects of prison life, from food service to technology to medical care.","A report released Tuesday by the Correction Ombuds DeVaughn Ward on the conditions of Connecticut’s state correctional facilities concluded that the system is “operating in a state of sustained institutional failure.” 
The 2025 Conditions of Confinement report examined several aspects of prison life, from food service to technology to medical care. The report described unsanitary conditions — like rodents, black mold and sewage backups — as well as delays in necessary medical care and staffing shortages that regularly confined incarcerated people to their cells.
Andrius Banevicius, spokesperson for the Department of Correction, said Commissioner Angel Quiros had sent Ward a letter saying the department “‘strongly objects to [the] grossly overstated and unsupported generalization,’ that the correctional system is operating in a state of ‘sustained institutional failure.’”
Banevicius said the ombuds’ report included “a number of allegations which are unsupported in either fact or law and appear to serve only to foster an extremely negative perception of the agency.”
Banevicius said that there is always “room for improvement” within the department. But he said, in certain cases, Ward had incorrectly portrayed singular incidents as problems that affected all the facilities. He also said that DOC had intentionally alerted Ward to many of the concerns in the report.  
“Any implication that the DOC has disregarded any of the concerns raised is simply not true,” Banevicius said. 
Food and living conditions
Findings in the report were based, in part, on complaints the ombuds received from incarcerated people and their family members.
In June, Ward received a complaint that mice were running through New Haven Correctional Center.
At Hartford Correctional Center, rodents became so pervasive that the facility had to shut down the kitchen for three to four weeks over the summer, according to the report.
In July, Ward heard from the relative of an incarcerated person that there were sewage backups at Bridgeport Correctional Center, “feces and urine throughout the facility[,] all over the floor.” 
At York Correctional Institution, Ward heard there were only one or two showers available for 25 women, amid ongoing maintenance. He was also told of shortages in hygiene supplies, including toilet paper. According to one complaint, a memo was sent out telling residents they’d have to purchase their own toilet paper through the commissary. 
Ward also found black mold, a build-up of dust and debris on air vents and on surveillance cameras at MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution, and shower vents covered in grey mold at Hartford CC during tours of the facilities he took in 2024 and 2025. 
High levels of heat in the summer have exacerbated these conditions, Ward said.

Incarcerated women at York CI wrote to the ombuds in 2024 complaining about the quality of the food being served. One recounted receiving spoiled milk and moldy food and finding rodent droppings in the food. Another described the food as “barely edible,” often with freezer burn or “as hard as hockey pucks.” 
“They recently stopped providing peanut butter with breakfast on Thursdays, which had been part of the regular menu for decades. Kitchen staff told us that peanut butter is ‘too expensive,’ which is hard to believe,” the person incarcerated at York said in their complaint, which was quoted in the ombuds’ report. “While incarcerated individuals are served whatever is put together, kitchen staff use the same state-provided food to prepare meals for themselves, including burgers and French fries — items that incarcerated individuals do not receive.” 
Several other incarcerated individuals and their family members raised concerns that the diet in correctional facilities makes people more vulnerable to high cholesterol, diabetes and hypertension. 
Ward said that while conducting inspections at the facilities, he saw “visibly unclean kitchen equipment and food preparation areas.” He recommended the department bring in professional contractors to address the mold, rodents and buildup on the vents, rather than relying on incarcerated men and women. Ward also suggested that the department’s food services coordinate with medical staff to make sure that people with medically-necessary diets were getting the food they need. 
Incarcerated people should also have more frequent showers, laundry and bedding changes during extreme heat, the report said.

Medical 
Reports of failures to provide adequate medical care to people housed in state correctional facilities have made headlines, including a recent report from the state inspector general that found “significant medical errors” in the prescription of methadone and other prescribed drugs, which led to the death of two men in Garner Correctional Institution. 
According to Tuesday’s ombuds’ report, Ward’s office has received more than 143 medical-related complaints since September 2024. 
In one case, Ward received a complaint that a man housed at Carl Robinson Correctional Institution was having flu-like symptoms for a significant period of time, and later began experiencing rectal bleeding. Despite repeated requests, he was not seen by a medical professional. 
Another complaint recounted that a family member incarcerated at Osborn Correctional Institution had chest pain for four months and discovered “a palpable lump in the center of his chest.” Rather than send him for further testing, the complaint alleged, correctional staff gave him ibuprofen. 
The family member of a person at York CI wrote that their loved one had tried to get medical attention for a recurring ear condition. By the time the individual was sent to UConn Health, the condition had progressed and required two surgeries. 
Ward also received complaints from York CI about delays in receiving glasses and contact lenses. Osborn CI hasn’t had an optometrist at the facility for two years. 
One person at MacDougall-Walker waited nearly a year for a recommended colonoscopy. And at Corrigan Correctional Center, people with psychotic disorders were allegedly taken off their antipsychotic medications and prescribed new drugs, “resulting in periods of untreated psychosis.” 
Ward did not offer recommendations directly related to medical care, but he noted that the department has no centralized system to keep track of how long incarcerated people have been waiting to see a doctor or a specialist, which he said “constrains both internal quality-improvement efforts and external oversight.”  
Staff
Lockdowns at facilities across Connecticut have been a near-constant source of complaints from incarcerated men and women. In July, frequent lockdowns became one of the top complaints from several men at Cheshire Correctional Institution who held a hunger strike in protest of conditions at the facility. 
According to the ombuds’ report, between 2015 and 2024 the number of correction officers declined by roughly 11% to 3,500. During the same period, the number of incarcerated people in the state declined by 34%. 
Lockdowns can lead to cancelled programming, recreation time, family visits — even showers. An advocate who wrote to Ward, as well as an incarcerated person, both noted that lockdowns often happened on holidays.
Ward suggested that the department explore the possibility of bringing back retired correction officers to staff the prisons, allowing counselors and other non-correctional staff to take on more responsibilities, and creating plans to prioritize things like medical care and visits during lockdowns. 
Ward also flagged reports from DOC staff and a complaint from an incarcerated person’s attorney that incarcerated men and women were being retaliated against for speaking with his office. “Officers have made statements such as ‘you threw us under the bus’ and ‘now you’re in for it,’” the attorney told Ward. 
He also noted the presence of certain political symbols at the facilities, such as the “Don’t Tread on Me” flag, which he recommended removing. He suggested that the department enforce stronger protections against retaliation and restrict the use of lockdowns outside of non-emergency situations. 
Libraries and communications
In October, Ward asked the Department of Correction to suspend its contract with the Inmate Legal Assistance Program, or ILAP, claiming it has done little to help people seeking to file court cases from prison. 
Ward said in Tuesday’s report that he’d received multiple complaints about the lack of law libraries and legal help at different facilities. York CI, the state’s only women’s facility, has no law library. A complaint from a family member whose loved one was incarcerated in the Walker portion of MacDougall-Walker, said their family member was unable to access the library in MacDougall. 
Ward recommended that York, along with the four county facilities that do not have libraries, should install law libraries for the people being held there, and that the department allow incarcerated men and women to access more records on electronic tablets. He also noted that at Osborn CI, incarcerated men were not allowed to make copies of legal records, meaning they had to wait for staff to make the copies, which had led to delays. 
Requiring staff to copy or approve documents, Ward said, could “chill the filing of grievances or legal actions related to conditions of confinement.” 
Ward said he’d also received complaints about incarcerated men and women having to wait long periods to access tablet devices, which “effectively deprive[s] incarcerated individuals of communication, information, and programming services.” 
Even when tablets are available, they don’t always work. An incarcerated person at MacDougall-Walker told Ward in a complaint that Wi-Fi at the facility regularly went out for days at a time. 
One family member complained that the communications app frequently crashes, making it difficult for them to communicate with the incarcerated person. And they said the app’s customer service representatives were unhelpful.
Incarcerated men and women also complained about cancelled video visits, sometimes at the last minute because of facility lockdowns.
In addition to recommending suspension of the ILAP contract, Ward said the department should seek to partner with the state Division of Public Defender Services  and other legal aid organizations to offer assistance to incarcerated individuals.

Rogers, a former Congressman who represented a mid-Michigan district from 2001 to 2015, sat on the company’s cybersecurity and technical innovations board for more than five years, earning nearly $100,000 in compensation as a result, according to public financial disclosures filed during his 2024 run for the U.S. Senate and his most recent bid.
When asked, Rogers’ campaign claimed that it was the first the former representative knew of the connection between Telefonica and the Maduro regime, despite the incident being widely reported by both a Spanish news outlet and The Washington Post.
Rogers’ campaign also said that his work with the board largely focused on advising Telefonica’s cybersecurity division on technical items and threats from China.
The campaign further blamed Democrats working against him for drawing a connection to him and Maduro that it claims did not exist, and chalked it up to “fake news about a former House Intelligence Chair and national security expert having ties to the very regime he has outspokenly condemned, and celebrated the downfall of.”
“Mike merely served on a technology advisory board, where he advised on how to stop the Chinese Communist Party from infecting the company’s networks,” said Rogers spokesperson Alyssa Brouliet. “This is nothing more than a flailing attempt to distract from the fact that the Michigan Democrat candidates are out-of-touch with working people and consistently trailing Mike Rogers by every barometer.”
The campaign was asked to provide Michigan Advance with a job description outlining Rogers’ role with the company showing that his work was focused solely on China.
An offer letter from Telefonica outlining Rogers’ role states that he would provide the board with “input, ideas and expert advice about Telefonica’s security decisions as requested by the company from time to time” according to the board’s specific charter.
The offer letter does not, however, specifically note that Rogers’ input and expertise was solely focused on Chinese security and network threats.










For years, there have been suspicions about the pervasiveness of tapped calls and the excessive and unjustified monitoring of other forms of communication, but this report has shed a light for the first time on the real scope of this threat to civil and digital rights across the country. 


– Watchdog group Ve Sin Filtro on the handing over of data by Telefonica to the Venezuelan government.


Whether Rogers knew the extent of the company’s collaboration with the Venezuelan government while he worked for Telefonica between April 2018 and October 2024 remains an open question, but what is certain is that Rogers has not publicly denounced the collaboration between Telefonica and the former Maduro regime.
The Advance asked Rogers’ campaign if it would do so now. The campaign responded only with the comment published in this story and a copy of his job description.
Rogers has, in the inverse, publicly praised President Donald Trump taking military action to depose Maduro, extradite him to the U.S. and put the former dictator up on drug trafficking charges in New York.
Rogers has a history of positioning himself as a major critic of Maduro 
Maduro came into power following Hugo Chavez’s death in 2013 and remained the head of state until the U.S. government, under the Trump regime, took action against Maduro earlier this month.
On the day Maduro was captured, Rogers made a public statement praising Trump’s action.
“President Trump sent a loud and clear message: don’t mess with the US. Any foreign adversary who tries to kill Americans will pay the price. Bin Laden learned that lesson when I served as House Intel Chair,” Rogers said in a statement. “Today, Maduro was held accountable for endangering our nation with deadly poison. More Americans have died from drug overdose since 2018 than in World War I, World War II, & the Vietnam War combined. The crisis has to stop. Thankfully, President Trump is taking bold action to keep our communities safe. Our borders are secure, murders in US cities are down with drug interdiction and deportation of criminal illegal aliens, and waterborne drugs running into the US are down over 90%. Now, we’re bringing narcoterrorists to justice.”
A search of Rogers’ social media pages shows that he was quick to criticize both Maduro, in 2019, and former President Joe Biden, in 2024, over crime and immigration issues.
Rogers, as a featured guest on WOOD 106.9 FM, stated his belief that the world was better off without Maduro in power.
In 2019, Rogers posted to X, then Twitter, an article from insightcrime.org detailing criminal connections between Maduro and drug traffickers — an early pretext for charging Maduro with the crimes he now faces in the U.S. The article exposes what a former head of Venezuelan military intelligence witnessed in his time working for the regime, which included top figures in Maduro’s political orbit allowing drug traffickers to move freely in and out of Venezuela.
“This is the real Venezuela,” Rogers wrote in that post.
In 2024, Rogers criticized former President Joe Biden in a series of posts on X, saying the former president should declare the Tren de Aragua criminal gang a terrorist organization. Rogers brings up Maduro again in one post, as well.

It’s past time Joe Biden declares Tren da Aragua for what it is: An international criminal organization, terrorizing Americans.
Maduro is emptying his prisons and flooding America with dangerous criminals through our wide open border. Enough is enough.

An interview with Rogers conducted by former congressman Dave Camp for the University of Michigan’s Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy notes that the podcast was a vehicle to share his insider knowledge of foreign policy, federal police work and security insights.
Much of his work with the boards he served on in his post-congressional life centered around the same insider knowledge. Still, Rogers’ campaign said that it had first heard about Telefonica’s connection to Maduro, through its business in Venezuela, when the Advance had asked for a comment in the course of reporting this story.
The Telefonica-Maduro connection was widely reported in 2021
Telefonica’s security and cybersecurity advisory council was created in 2018, which the company said would reinforce its digital and comprehensive security strategy, as well as play a role in protecting its own assets and the data of its customers.
The council included Rogers, and highlighted his work with the FBI but also as a member of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee.
Public records show Rogers served on Telefonica’s Ingenieria Y Seguridad committee for six years. It was one of several boards he sat on after leaving the U.S. House of Representatives in 2015, each focused on cybersecurity and data intelligence, which falls in line with Rogers’ experience as chair of the House Intelligence Committee and as a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Multiple financial disclosure reports filed for his Senate campaigns, the first of which he narrowly lost to now-Sen. Elissa Slotkin, are accessible to the public on the Senate’s online database. They show Rogers received $94,241 as board compensation from Telefonica Ingenieria Y Seguridad. 
Compensation that he received from the board between 2018 and 2022 is not publicly available.

Telefonica, based in Madrid, Spain, has business throughout Latin America, working with different subsidiaries to provide region-specific cell phone services.
One of those regions is Venezuela, operating as Telefonica Movistar. In 2022, Telefonica released a transparency report that revealed a wide swath of data interceptions into the private communications of Venezuelan Telefonica Movistar customers at the behest of Maduro’s security agencies, according to the watchdog group Ve Sin Filtro.
The report said that the company, in 2021, worked at the behest of the Maduro regime to intercept those communications against 1.5 million customers in Venezuela, more than 20% of both telephone and internet lines offered by Telefonica Movistar. Calls were tapped, text messages were monitored and the locations of customer phones were handed over to Venezuelan authorities, Ve Sin Filtro reported. The interceptions also included the capturing of customer internet traffic.
Other nations within the region that were included in the report also had data interception within their home countries, but at a much lower rate than what Venezuela had acquired.
In some cases, specific internet pages were blocked and accounts hacked, which rang true in the case of a Venezuelan human rights organization. Some of these requests came from the National Telecommunications Commission, or CONATEL, which is the Venezuelan government’s regulatory body over telecommunications within its borders.
The watchdog group noted that data interceptions performed by telecoms on orders from their regulating governments can be key ways for law enforcement to investigate serious crimes, but the wide array of interceptions performed by Maduro’s regime pointed more toward systemic abuse of human rights standards and judicial due process.
Ve Sin Filtro reported that agencies that were able to access who a user was calling, how long the calls lasted, what the subscriber’s data showed, included the military, Venezuela’s public ministry, its main criminal investigation agency, police forces, and its National Experimental Security University.
“Nowhere does it mention that the orders come from courts or come with the approval of judges, as they do in other countries, which means there isn’t evidence of the validation of courts for these interventions as it is required by Venezuelan law, with particular exceptions such as the case of emergencies and flagrant crimes, in which the CICPC can make a direct request,” the group said, referring to Telefonica’s transparency report. “But even in these cases the prosecutor must be notified and it must be included in the file.”
Spanish newspaper El Pais reported on the document, noting that the admission fell in line with what human rights organizations have called massive surveillance of the Venezuelan people over the course of the last decade. It also noted that human rights defenders in Venezuela believed the espionage targeted opposition politicians and activists.
The Washington Post also reported on the company’s report and findings, writing that the incursions included wire taps but also the censoring of content like news websites, political commentary portals, and even streaming media websites like SoundCloud. Three human rights organizations were blocked by Telefonica and the Maduro regime and two websites providing VPN, or virtual private network, services. People in restrictive nations often use private networks to access internet service or webpages that are censored in their regions, and have played a key role in pushing out social media content during times of protest or revolution.
The Post also interviewed Miguel Henrique Otero, president of El Nacional, one of Venezuela’s last remaining independent newspapers, when it wrote about the issue in 2022. 
He said it was clear to him and other like-minded Venezuelans that Telefonica was complicit in following orders from the Maduro regime to violate human rights, without justification or due process.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Facetune_03-10-2024-14-16-28-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 14:57:20.060499

At a Boston hearing, US Sen. Ed Markey and Reps. Ayanna Pressley and Seth Moulton sharply criticized the administration’s plan to let Temporary Protected Status expire for Haitian immigrants, a decision that would put roughly 350,000 people nationwide — including about 4,700 in Massachusetts — at risk of deportation.
Pressley underscored the scale of the issue in Massachusetts, home to one of the largest Haitian communities in the country. “My district represents the third largest Haitian diaspora in the country. More than 77,000 Haitians call the commonwealth their home,” she said.
TPS is granted to people from countries facing conflict, natural disaster or other extraordinary conditions. 
“TPS has received bipartisan support for over 30 years as a program,” Pressley said, noting that Haitians have relied on the status since the 2010 earthquake and, more recently, after the assassination of Haiti’s president and a surge in gang violence.
While the lawmakers focused their criticism on the Trump administration’s decision to let the designation expire, both Pressley and Markey stressed that their advocacy has spanned administrations of both parties.
Pressley said she has “urged Democratic and Republican Presidents alike… to support Haiti, to support Haiti in its efforts to build the nation, to support a democratic transition.” Markey echoed that point, saying, “I have called on every recent American president to designate, extend and re-designate TPS for Haiti.”
Still, the tone toward the current administration was clear. Markey said that despite evidence of worsening conditions, “it’s clear to all, including the Trump administration, that Haitian TPS holders cannot return home safely. That’s what we give that protection for, because they cannot go home.”
Markey described a country paralyzed by violence and disaster. Since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, he said, gangs have seized control of much of Port-au-Prince, with kidnappings and armed attacks blocking access to medical care, education and commerce. Natural disasters have further battered Haiti’s already fragile infrastructure.
The hearing came against the backdrop of an ongoing federal court case in Washington, DC, where lawyers are seeking to block the expiration of TPS while a lawsuit challenging the administration’s decision proceeds. A federal judge is expected to rule by February 2, the day before the protections are scheduled to end.
The potential reversal marks a turn from 18 months ago, when the Biden administration extended Haiti’s TPS designation through February 3, 2026, citing ongoing violence, political instability and environmental disasters. That extension was welcomed by Massachusetts officials, who noted that Haitians made up the vast majority of new arrivals to the state at the time. Many of these immigrants took low-paying jobs filling gaps in the health care sector.
Advocates of the administration’s decision say the move is part of a broader push to enforce immigration laws and return TPS to its original temporary intent, with the Department of Homeland Security arguing that permitting Haitian nationals to remain temporarily in the United States “is contrary to the national interest.”
“This decision restores integrity in our immigration system and ensures that Temporary Protective Status is actually temporary,” a DHS spokesperson said in an announcement from June about the termination of the status.
The spokesperson said, “The environmental situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home.”
At Tuesday’s hearing, lawmakers emphasized the economic and social ties Haitian TPS holders have built in Massachusetts. Markey offered a personal reflection from his hometown. 
“I live in Malden… My neighbors are now Haitians in ward two in Malden, and they work hard. They work two jobs,” he said.
Moulton framed the issue through his experience responding to the 2010 earthquake as a veteran accompanying Boston medical teams. 
“What I witnessed in Haiti was the best of Boston, the best of Massachusetts, the best of America showing up to help those in need,” he said. He said that Haitians who later settled in Massachusetts have repaid that compassion, “strengthening the American quilt as their fabric has become interwoven with our own.” Allowing TPS to expire now, Moulton said, would “tear all that apart.”
Advocates and TPS holders on the panel described the personal toll of the uncertainty. Franklin Soults of 32BJ SEIU said one of the misunderstandings about TPS is that it does not provide a direct pathway to citizenship or permanent residency, such as through a green card.
“There is no path for them to normalize their status, to turn it into something permanent,” he said, adding that he’s advocated for years in Washington unsuccessfully to reform this.
Soults read testimony from Jerome, a Haitian TPS holder living on the North Shore with his wife and 10-year-old daughter, a US citizen. Jerome’s wife, a caretaker, expects to lose her job when TPS expires next month. 
Jerome said his daughter tries hard in school, but he’s beginning to see the anxiety wear on her. 
“I can see the stress of her thinking all the time, what will my life be like if my parents can’t be with me?” Soults said, reading from Jerome’s testimony.
Another panelist, Bruno, who fled Haiti after the 2010 earthquake destroyed the grocery store he owned and operated there, spoke about how grateful he’s been to raise his three children in the United States. He is a driver for the MBTA who is also working on getting his commercial driver’s license.
“We are profoundly grateful to the United States for welcoming us down in that time of crisis,” he said. “My children have been brought up, been educated here, and become part of the fabric of Massachusetts. This is their home today.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/696fb93d5aa3d.webp?fit=1024%2C679&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-20 14:57:20.060499

(Photo courtesy of the  Lacore campaign)The former chief of Navy Reserve is joining at least 14 other candidates running for South Carolina’s coastal 1st Congressional District.
Retired-Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore, who spent 35 years in the Navy, announced Tuesday that she’s running as a Democrat for the seat held since 2020 by U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, who is running for governor.
Lacore told the SC Daily Gazette that she was removed from her leadership role last August by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. She said she was given no reason why she was fired and declined to speculate.
The Associated Press reported at the time that the firing was among a series of moves targeting perceived critics of President Donald Trump.
14 candidates are running to replace Rep. Nancy Mace in Congress

Lacore said she and her husband, also a Navy helicopter pilot, moved to Mount Pleasant in October after buying a house there last spring.
A native of Albany, New York, she moved frequently while in the Navy. She spent the first 10 years of her Navy career on active duty. As a reservist, she was deployed twice: in 2011 to Afghanistan and 2017 to Djibouti, a small country on Africa’s northeast coast.
The mother of six said she decided to make her first run for elected office Dec. 1, the same day she officially retired from the Navy, because she worried about the country’s direction.
The 10 Republicans and four Democrats who have already announced runs to replace Mace include five other military veterans.
“I think our military is being politicized,” Lacore told the Gazette. “I think our democracy’s at risk, to be honest, and I want to be a part of the solution.”
While a fairly new South Carolina resident, Lacore said her ties to the Palmetto State include a daughter and her husband graduating from the University of South Carolina. They live in the Lowcountry, and she’s been vacationing in the Lowcountry for a decade, she said.
Lacore led about 59,000 sailors as chief of the Navy Reserve, a job she held for a year. She relieved Vice Adm. John Mustin in August 2024. Her successes included working with Congress to secure new airplanes for the reserve, she said.
The job is an appointed position, filled by a president’s nomination and the Senate’s confirmation.

(Stock photo by Doug Wilson via Getty Images)Townhouse complexes with six or fewer units would not be required to have sprinklers for fire protection under a bill given initial approval Tuesday by an Iowa Senate subcommittee.
Senate File 310 proposes eliminating from the state building code required installation of fire protection sprinkler systems in “a series of attached single-family residences consisting of fewer than seven units” — meaning townhouses with six units or less in the property. The measure would also prohibit local building regulations from requiring sprinkler systems for these townhouse properties.
Sen. Scott Webster, R-Bettendorf, said this proposal is an amended version of legislation discussed in 2025, which had language saying six or less residential “units” would not have to have sprinklers installed. The previous language would have removed sprinkler requirements for multi-level apartment and condominium buildings. The changed language specifies that only townhouse properties — residences with multiple attached units that share one or more wall — will not have to install sprinklers.
While several firefighter and public safety advocates said they appreciated the changed language, many of these groups still registered in opposition to the measure.
David Schipper, fire rescue chief of Le Mars and past president of the Iowa Fire Chiefs Association, said removing this requirement also means new townhomes being constructed in rural Iowa would not be subject to building inspections for fire safety standards that currently come with sprinkler installation. In Le Mars, he said, fire marshals conduct inspections of new construction for sprinklers, which may not occur if this requirement is removed.
“Who is going to be inspecting then in rural Iowa … I don’t think the Legislature plans on adding a bunch of inspectors to (the Department of Inspections, Licensing and Appeals) making sure that if we’re not sprinkling them, we’re doing the proper sheet rocking for fire protection?” Schipper said.
He said removing this provision and not having building inspections in place will make fires more dangerous “for volunteer firefighters, especially, that show up maybe 13 to 15 minutes after a fire started in one of these, and instead of having one on fire, one condo on fire, we have all six on fire, making it more risky for people who live there, of course, our firefighters who have to put these fires out.”
Lobbyists with organizations like the Iowa Association of Realtors and Home Builders Association of Iowa said they supported the measure as a means to make housing more affordable in Iowa. However, Chelsea Hoye with the Iowa League of Cities said while she understood concerns about housing affordability, she said “possible higher insurance costs might offset that cost savings” from not installing sprinklers.
Webster said he personally has had experience as a home builder, insurance agent and insurance adjuster, and said the insurance company he worked for issued a surcharge for properties with sprinkler systems because of mold concerns. He said the sprinkler requirements, alongside many other building code requirements, were brought up at at International Residential Code, Federal Building Code or other regulation-setting meetings where private enterprise and business officials and gave lunches and gift cards to public officials as “the way that private enterprise gets their product shoved into the building code and required all in the name of safety.”
He said the sprinkler requirement “went overboard,” and that while many local entities have attempted to remove the provision, they are “getting forced to put it back in” by state regulation. But removing this provision is part of the balance as lawmakers try to “find a way to make more affordable in Iowa while holding on to safety standards.”
“I am telling you, this is a way to make homes more affordable in Iowa, still maintaining safety …” for structures that are too large for firefighters to safely contain a blaze, Webster said. “I’m more than happy to talk to anybody with ideas, that is a way to get through this, but it is very expensive to put in a fire sprinkler in a home — it doesn’t really save on your insurance.”
He and Sen. Mark Lofgren, R-Muscatine, signed to move the measure to the Senate Local Government Committee. Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner did not support the bill advancing, pointing to “serious safety concerns” about fires spreading in these properties as well as perspectives that this provision may not reduce housing costs.

MONTPELIER — Vermont Gov. Phil Scott proposed a $9.4 billion budget to state lawmakers on Tuesday that he called a “disciplined” spending plan for the upcoming fiscal year in the face of wavering support from the federal government.
Scott’s proposal is about 3% larger than the budget he and the Legislature put in place for the current year. But he said the spending plan calls for fewer new initiatives than state budgets in recent years, largely because the state no longer has the ability to use Covid-19 era relief funding from the federal government for new purposes.
He also pointed to how the state’s top economists lowered, by about $8 million, their past estimates for how much revenue the state will bring in over the current fiscal year, which ends in June. That decrease — albeit a modest one — showed the state needs to be frugal, Scott said Tuesday, addressing a joint assembly of the House and Senate.
At the same time, officials from Scott’s administration pointed at a briefing with reporters earlier Tuesday to how Vermont is poised to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid and other human services programs supported by the federal government over the next several years, as state officials have projected.
Scott’s budget would leave available $70 million lawmakers set aside last year to respond to federal cuts this year, the officials said. But they acknowledged that amount would not be enough to fully plug the gaps in some key programs. 
The budget proposal would use $105 million to reduce the average property tax increase across the state this year from an estimated 12% to about 5.5%. That request is up from the $75 million his administration had previously indicated it wanted to use for that purpose.
The additional $30 million would come from a pot of money lawmakers set aside in 2025 to offer tax relief or to respond to cuts from the federal government, Scott administration officials told reporters on Tuesday. 
Meanwhile, compared to the current year’s budget, Scott wants to reduce, by $10 million, the amount of revenue from the state’s purchase-and-use tax that is directed to Vermont’s Education Fund. That tax is levied on the purchase of new vehicles. 
Instead, that money should be directed to the state’s Transportation Fund, he said, which is facing significant funding challenges as revenue from taxes on gasoline has long slowed. Scott said his goal is to eliminate the use of vehicle purchase tax revenue for education costs completely in the future.
Administration officials indicated Tuesday that the Vermont Agency of Transportation could need to lay off additional employees in the coming year as a result of those funding challenges, though they did not provide specifics.
Scott also said his administration would again present a package of changes to Act 250, the state’s signature land use law. He also proposed an expansion of the “accountability court” set up in Burlington last year, which is aimed at slimming a persistent backlog of pending court cases, to other counties. 
Tuesday’s spending plan would cover the 2027 fiscal year, which will start in July 2026 and end in June 2027.

(via Maine Center for Economic Policy)Starting May 1, workers across Maine will be able to access paid family and medical leave. 
The Maine Paid Leave Authority decided the start date at a meeting Tuesday. According to a news release from the Maine Women’s Lobby, the authority considered the solvency of the benefit fund and determined that starting the program in early May met their fiduciary obligation. 
The paid leave program was established by the Maine Legislature in 2023 and will allow eligible public and private sector workers to take up to 12 weeks of paid leave for reasons such as illness, to care for a loved one, or the birth of a new child. 
Maine employers began withholding a portion of wages about a year ago to pay into the fund, so this newly determined start date offers a clear timeline of when workers will be able to tap the new benefit.
Employers with 15 or more workers contribute 1% of wages, but may deduct half of that from employee wages. Employers with fewer employees will contribute 0.5% and may take all of it from employees’ wages. 
“When benefits go live this spring, we will see the culmination of years of work toward a more just, equitable economy that values families, caregivers, and all workers,” said Destie Hohman Sprague, executive director of the Maine Women’s Lobby.
Applications for workers to access paid leave are not available yet, but the Maine Department of Labor will release more information on how to access them at a later date. 
The program has faced legal challenges throughout its development, including a lawsuit from the Maine State Chamber of Commerce and Bath Iron Works challenging the department’s rules. However, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court unanimously decided that the rules adopted by the Maine Department of Labor are constitutional and a legal interpretation of the legislation that created the program.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/349070298_272323178516091_3409772876437276289_n-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-20 14:57:20.060499

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)The Commissioner of Securities and Insurance Office helped stop a fraudulent multimillion dollar billing scheme by agents preying on Native Americans on reservations, Commissioner James Brown announced this month.
In cooperation with health insurers, tribal communities and law enforcement, the investigation secured more than $23.3 million of fraudulently incurred claims through the Affordable Care Act, Brown said. An additional $27 million is pending.

“The most reprehensible aspect of this scheme is how the people who were allegedly provided ‘care’ were vulnerable populations that were, in some cases, exploited, coerced, moved across state lines, and not even so much as given a way to get back home to Montana,” Brown said in a statement.
In an interview, Brown said some Montana victims who were taken out of state for treatment that never took place have yet to be found.
Brown said his office met with tribes in Montana throughout 2025 to alert them to the scheme. It also made referrals to federal law enforcement authorities in Montana and the FBI office in Los Angeles where the alleged crimes took place.
In an interview, Brown described the way bad actors used a provision in the Affordable Care Act to victimize Native Americans to try to defraud an insurance company, how the scheme led to as much as $54.7 million in unjustified claims, and discussed the work that remains in the aftermath.
In January 2025, PacificSource reported suspected fraudulent ACA enrollment to the Commissioner of Securities and Insurance, and the office launched an investigation a couple of weeks later, according to a timeline provided by CSI.
Under the Affordable Care Act, Native Americans are able to enroll in the federal marketplace at any time, Brown said; they don’t have to wait for open enrollment.
Fraudsters operating out of Arizona and, for the purposes of the Montana scheme, California, used that provision to entice Native Americans to disenroll from Medicaid and sign up for health insurance through the ACA instead, Brown said.
In particular, he said, the agents would set up information booths on reservations — he believes nearly every reservation in Montana has been a target — and tell people about free drug and alcohol treatment at a beautiful facility in southern California.
The schemers would then transport victims across state lines by buying them a plane ticket to California or driving them in a van; keep them for 90 days while providing “fake services”; and then bill the insurance company $9,000 a day for 90 days, Brown said.
The billing was for services that didn’t take place, were unnecessary, or were provided at “greatly inflated prices,” according to the Commissioner of Securities and Insurance.
Brown said the bad actors abused “Obamacare” and trafficked “vulnerable Native Americans.” He said at least 183 people were victimized.
“We’re still trying to find some of these people, honestly,” Brown said.
The Office of Indian Affairs could not be reached Monday about any efforts to find people. The FBI in Montana also could not be reached in time for this story.
Brown said insurance abuse leads to higher premiums for everyone, but the investigation from his office and work with the Trump administration has meant $23.3 million in payments don’t have to be made to date.
Brown said an additional $27 million is pending a decision by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. He said so far, 80 policy recissions have been granted, and dozens remain under review.
Brown said PacificSource first suspected a problem when it came across half a million dollars in alcohol and substance abuse being billed out of southern California and the southwest part of the country.
“That is what set their alarm bells off, and they approached us for help,” Brown said.
He said his office conducted an investigation that supported the ability of CMS to approve the non-payment of fraudulent claims and rescind the policies. CSI has a team of four investigators, and he said his office spent seven months on the investigation.
The team uncovered falsified records, unlicensed and out-of-state actors, fabricated addresses, and unsupported earnings information used to obtain coverage, according to CSI. It also found “immediate, high-dollar billing patterns designed to extract maximum payouts.”
In a statement provided by CSI, PacificSource spokesperson Erik Wood thanked Brown and his team for helping stop suspected fraudulent activity in the marketplace.
“As a nonprofit health plan, PacificSource exists to keep health care accessible and affordable for our members, and preventing fraud is an important part of that work,” Wood said. “We appreciate the state’s commitment to protecting Montanans and the integrity of our health insurance system.”
PacificSource is a not-for-profit health insurance provider and one of three insurers that offer plans under the Affordable Care Act.
Brown said his office is helping to re-enroll victims into Medicaid so they have coverage. He encouraged Montanans to be wary of any alleged agents advising disenrollment in Medicaid and recommending treatment programs in California through the Affordable Care Act.
Brown said Arizona and Alaska also have dealt with a variation of the scheme. He said any state with a significant Native American population is a target, and he has talked with his counterparts and insurance providers in Washington and Wyoming to alert them to the scheme.
Brown said his office has “zero tolerance for fraud” and it is focused on consumer protection that “works for the people of Montana as opposed to scammers.” He said his office is pursuing additional investigations and will ask for an additional investigator in the future.
“We don’t tolerate corruption, and we don’t apologize for enforcing the law,” Brown said in a statement. “If you exploit vulnerable people or try to game our system, we will come after you.”

(Screenshot/YouTube)Manufacturers that advertise vaccines in Florida that cause injury or harm could be sued under a bill sponsored by Fort Pierce Republican Erin Grall.
Over objections by lobbyists representing organized medicine and business interests, the Senate Committee on Regulated Industries voted, 5-3, Tuesday to pass the proposal, SB 408.
Specifically, the bill would amend Florida law regulating drugs and cosmetics to allow an individual to file a lawsuit within three years following an alleged vaccine-related injury. The bill would provide one-way attorney fees, allowing any claimant who wins to recover “reasonable attorney fees” but not allow winning defendants to do the same.
Traditionally in Florida, one-way fees have been intended to balance the interests of ordinary people against deep-pocketed interests.
The bill defines “advertise” as “a media communication, including, but not limited to, television, radio, print, the Internet, digital or electronic media, product placement, promotion by an influencer in exchange for compensation, or any other manner of paid promotion, that a vaccine manufacturer purchases to promote the manufacturer’s vaccine.”
Discussions between health care providers and their patients or written or promotional materials regarding vaccines, or any promotional materials concerning vaccines displayed in health care facilities, would be specifically exempt from the definition of advertise.
According to a staff analysis of the bill, healthcare and pharmaceutical digital ad spending for 2025 was estimated at $24.8 billion, with traditional ad spending at about $7.9 billion.
Bill sponsor Grall said she thinks the measure would help increase vaccine rates in Florida, which have been plummeting. Statewide, the percentage of fully immunized two-year-olds dropped from about 85% a decade ago to roughly 75%, Grall said.
“Public trust regarding vaccines has diminished. I would argue that increased knowledge of the virtual immunity that manufactures have with regards to vaccine-related injuries has contributed to this declining trust,” Grall told members of the committee Tuesday morning.
“Vaccines have served an important public health service to eradicate disease, and this bill, I believe, is s step in rebuilding public trust of proven vaccines by holding manufacturers accountable.”
Florida Justice Reform Institute President William Large said the bill most likely would run afoul of federal laws that limit vaccine manufacturer liability in certain respects and establish compensation for injuries related to vaccines.
He touched on the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), a no-fault program funded by vaccine manufacturers through an excise tax on each vaccine dose. The VICP covers most vaccines routinely given in the United States. Benefits include rehabilitation costs, pain and suffering, attorney fees, and, in the case of death, $250,000.
Another federal law Large referenced is the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2005 (PREP), which authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services secretary to issue a so-called PREP Act declaration. The declaration allows the government to limit the liability of manufacturers, distributors, health care providers, and others for losses related to the administration or use of vaccines other other countermeasures to blunt any threat.
The PREP law also authorizes HHS to establish the Countermeasure Injury Compensation Program (CICP) to compensate claimants for serious physical injuries and death caused by certain vaccines.
CICP recoveries may include medical expenses, a portion of lost employment income, and a survivor death benefit.
Lastly, there’s the federal Food and Drug Cosmetics Act, which deals with labeling and failure to warn.
Preemption
“Most of this area of law is preempted by three federal acts,” Large said. “I’m also concerned it violates the First Amendment. And it’s also our position it’s bad public policy.”
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has criticized the VICP, calling it “biased” and “corrupt.” Kennedy, who owns a financial stake in a lawsuit against Merck over claims the pharmaceutical company failed to properly warn consumers about risks from its HPV vaccine, Gardasil, has said the protections remove incentives for vaccines to be safe.
Grall’s bill provides that an injured individual may bring an action within three years following accrual of the cause of action. Finally, the bill provides that a court can award a claimant who prevails in an action actual damages, court costs, and reasonable attorney fees.
There’s an identical proposal (HB 339) in the House filed by Rep. Monique Miller, a Republican from Palm Bay.
Committee Chair Sen. Jennifer Bradley, a Fleming Island Republican, thanked Grall for the bill, saying that in the aftermath of the COVID pandemic it’s an important conversation for the Legislature to have.
She said the United States is one of two countries that allow vaccine manufacturers to directly advertise to patients. While she stressed she’s no “anti-vaxer” Bradley said today’s environment is vastly differently than 40 years ago when the federal government agreed to pass the vaccine injury compensation fund in order to help ensure an adequate supply of childhood vaccines.
The environment today, Bradley said, is an “atmosphere of distrust.”
“I think this is an important conversation as we see the rise of a lot of diseases and a lot of cases with an uptick. I think we really need to take a hard look at the public trust we have in these big systems,” she said.
“Is this bill perfect? I don’t think so. Can it get better? Can we talk about it? We can put our head in the sand, but public trust in our health system is weak right now. And I think there are things we can do and conversations we can have to remedy that and to build that back. And I think this is a great first conversation.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Vaccines2-e1605720731166.png,,,2026-01-20 13:57:20.681082

The Bulldogs were No. 6 in the final poll for the second straight season and have ended in the top 10 every since since 2017. Texas Tech is a season-ending top-10 team for the first time. Texas A&M hadn’t been ranked in a final poll season since Jimbo Fisher’s 2020 team was No. 4. Alabama, which had ended every season between 2008-23 in the top 10, was back after slipping to No. 17 last year.
Notre Dame won 10 straight games following an 0-2 start, was left out of the playoff and opted to not play in a bowl game. The Irish slipped one spot and were ranked in a ninth straight final poll.
The Hoosiers were No. 20 in the preseason poll after going 11-2 in Curt Cignetti’s first season. They earned their then-highest ranking ever at No. 3 after they won at Oregon to go 6-0. They moved up to No. 2 the following week and stayed there for seven straight polls. Their 13-10 win over Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game pushed them to No. 1 heading into the playoff.
Poll points
— No. 17 Iowa was ranked for the first time this season after winning three straight, including a bowl win over Vanderbilt. No. 22 Houston beat Baylor and LSU to end the season and was ranked for the first time in four polls. No. 25 TCU, which had been 18 spots out of the Top 25, was ranked for the first time since September after beating Houston, Cincinnati and USC.

NEWARK — Gov. Mikie Sherrill took multiple shots at President Donald Trump on Tuesday after she was sworn in as New Jersey’s 57th governor on a stage at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.
Sherrill, 54, a Democrat who is just the second woman in history to be chief executive of the Garden State, never mentioned the Republican president by name, but she connected the nation’s fight for independence from a king 250 years ago with opposition to the Trump administration’s actions today.
“This election proved that the people of New Jersey recognize the parallels. That we see a president illegally usurping power, unconstitutionally enacting a tariff regime to make billions for himself and his family, while everyone else sees their costs go higher. Here, we demand people in public service actually serve the public instead of buying themselves planes and cars and extorting money,” she said.
Gov. Sherrill orders credits to offset electricity hikes coming in June

The attacks on Trump drew an enthusiastic response from the 2,000-plus people gathered in the Newark theater.
“I want you to know that I will be fighting for you. And I hope, New Jersey, you’ll remember me when you open your electric bill and it hasn’t gone up by 20 percent. I can promise you, it won’t be because I waste your money on a ballroom at Drumthwacket,” Sherrill said.
Sherrill was sworn in by New Jersey Supreme Court Chief Justice Stuart Rabner on Founding Father William Paterson’s copy of the state Constitution, the U.S. Constitution, and the Declaration of Independence, held by her husband, Jason Hedberg.
Sherrill defeated Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli in November by 14 points, and the election was largely seen as a referendum on the second Trump administration. She said Tuesday that she wasn’t surprised “in the least” at the results.
“Because I know the people of New Jersey. Yes, we are loud and brash, and sometimes we tan like it’s 1980, our Giants, our Jets, and Eagles don’t even claim our state as home despite our rabid devotion. There are an inordinate number of young men wearing chains here, including my two sons,” she said.
She succeeds former Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who was barred from seeking a third term last year. Murphy joined former governors Chris Christie, Jon Corzine, Jim McGreevey, Christine Todd Whitman, and Thomas Kean Sr. in attendance. Other lawmakers on the stage included most of the state’s congressional delegation, state legislative leadership, and Sherrill’s former D.C. roommate, new Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger.

Lt. Gov. Dale Caldwell was also sworn in Tuesday on his family’s Bible, held by his daughter, Ashley.
“Today is a reminder of what progress looks like. It is a reminder of what resilience, hope, and courage can achieve,” Caldwell said. “And it is a reminder that our work of fulfilling the promise to we the people is never finished.”
Sherrill used her inaugural speech to sign two executive orders, including one that expands a credit program Murphy unveiled last year intended to offset electric rate hikes. Freezing rates was a key plank of Sherrill’s campaign for governor.
A former Navy helicopter pilot, Sherrill most recently represented the 11th Congressional District, which includes parts of Essex, Passaic, and Morris counties. She was also previously a federal prosecutor at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Amid an increasingly aggressive national deportation campaign by the Trump administration and reports that Merrimack might play a more significant role in that campaign soon, New Hampshire Democrats are trying to prevent state, county, or municipal funding from being used to assist.
House Bill 1609, filed by state Rep. David Meuse, would prohibit New Hampshire and its counties, towns, and cities from spending any money on immigrant detention facilities or other efforts to detain immigrants. It would also block those political subdivisions from selling, donating, or repurposing property it owns for use as an immigrant detention facility. 
The bill makes an exception for police or sheriff’s departments that have entered into a 287(g) agreement with the Department of Homeland Security. A 287(g) agreement is a partnership in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly known as ICE, allows local law enforcement agencies to act as immigration officers, interrogate people suspected of not having legal status to live in the country, and arrest them for allegedly violating immigration laws. In New Hampshire, 13 agencies — the State Police, four sheriff’s departments, and eight local police departments — have signed such agreements. HB 1609 as it is currently written would not impact those agreements, which have expanded greatly nationwide under the Trump administration.
At a legislative hearing last week, Meuse, who represents Portsmouth, said the bill was about both “the future of mass incarceration of immigrants in New Hampshire and fiscal responsibility.”
Meuse, along with fellow Democrats and several citizens testifying at a legislative hearing on the bill last week, decried the Trump administration’s deportation efforts as cruel and, in their estimation, illegal. Meuse pointed to “Alligator Alcatraz,” an ICE detention center built earlier this year in the Florida Everglades that has been plagued by allegations of severe maltreatment, civil rights violations, and poor conditions, as what could go wrong with an immigrant detention facility in New Hampshire.
Meuse pointed out that in July, when Congress passed President Donald Trump’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act, it set aside billions of taxpayers dollars for immigration enforcement. The new law appropriated roughly $30 billion to ICE over the course of several years, nearly tripling the agency’s annual budget (from roughly $9.9 billion a year to $28 billion in the federal government’s fiscal year 2025) plus an additional $45 billion to build new immigration detention facilities. The bill also opens the door for the Trump administration to direct even more federal funding to immigration enforcement in the future.
“While the reality is that we have very few options when it comes to restricting the government from constructing facilities like this on property that the federal government actually owns or leases, New Hampshire taxpayers should not be forced to subsidize a federal agency that’s basically bathing in blood money right now,” Meuse said. “The bottom line is that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility. It is not a state responsibility, so let’s make sure paying for it remains a federal responsibility.”
Meuse and others also evoked reported plans to build a detention center in Merrimack. In December, The Washington Post, citing a leaked document from the Department of Homeland Security, reported that the federal government plans to build a network of new detention centers across the country by converting warehouses. The federal government plans to build one of those centers in Merrimack, according to the report.
Since that report, protests have erupted and rumors have begun swirling about where the site would be. State Rep. Rosemarie Rung, a Democrat representing Merrimack, shared a document on social media purporting to show a list of addresses where the facilities would be located. That document identified 50 Robert Milligan Parkway, a currently vacant industrial warehouse owned by the Trammel Crow Company, as the future site of a detention center. Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the Trammel Crow Company have responded to the Bulletin’s requests for confirmation or comment as of publication of this article.
Gov. Kelly Ayotte said earlier this month her team has heard nothing from the federal government about a potential detention facility in Merrimack. She said the news was “at this point, a speculative discussion.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/icedems-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-20 13:57:20.681082

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)A day late and $18 million short, the prospective buyer of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital is turning to state leaders to help close its purchase.
Ben Mingle, CEO and president of The Centurion Foundation, asked state officials in an email Friday to set up a taxpayer-funded reserve account to help the buyer clinch the private investment needed to close the deal, as first reported by WPRI-TV 12. The email, sent to Gov. Dan McKee, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, Senate President Valarie Lawson and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, was obtained by Rhode Island Current on Tuesday.
“Each investor has clearly stated that their investment is subject to, and conditioned upon, having a state-funded bond reserve fund in the amount of $18 Million,” Mingle wrote. “Centurion Foundation respectfully requests that legislation be introduced at the earliest possible time to allow for the approval and implementation of this bond reserve fund.”
Preserving the pair of hospitals in Providence and North Providence — with 500 beds, 50,000 annual emergency room visits and nearly 2,500 employees between them — has been a top concern of state officials, but none have put a price tag on what the state is willing to pay to keep the hospitals running. McKee, whose proposed fiscal 2027 spending plan did not include any money for the hospitals, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.
Shekarchi and Lawson remained noncommittal on the funding request.
“We will conduct our due diligence and are committed to a course of action that stabilizes these hospitals in the best interests of patients, hospital workers, and all Rhode Islanders,” they said in a joint statement Tuesday.
Mingle’s email was sent one day after Centurion missed the court-mandated deadline for Centurion to close the sale. Now the two Rhode Island hospitals are slated to be transferred to state ownership on Jan. 30 under a separate court agreement between the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office and the bankruptcy estate for current owner, Prospect Medical Holdings.
Neronha’s office had already started work on the expected transfer of the hospitals, which puts the onus on the state to assume all operating and payroll costs, along with liabilities and taxes by Jan. 30.
But Centurion thinks it can close the transaction by Feb. 28, contingent upon approval for the requested state reserve fund. Neronha said the buyer’s plan was “possible” while noting the uncertainties surrounding it.
“If what Centurion set forth in their letter in terms of taxpayer support is what they need to close by the end of next month, then the Governor and the General Assembly have to decide whether to grant and/or negotiate their request,” Neronha said in a statement Tuesday. “That is not my role or responsibility. That said, the Bankruptcy Court’s deadline for closing the transaction has come and gone and they are going to need the Court’s permission to extend the window for closing, and then someone is going to have to come up with the money to run the hospitals beyond the end of the month until they do close.”
But Neronha hinted at a new surprise in the hospital sale saga, indicating a possibility the story’s ending may be “pivoting in an entirely different direction.”
“I think clarity will come this week,” Neronha said.
Tim Rondeau, a spokesperson for Neronha’s office, did not immediately return requests for more information Tuesday.

The hospitals have been in jeopardy for years, with Prospect seeking to unload the costly assets from its balance sheet even before filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2025. The Centurion Foundation received conditional approval from state regulators to buy the hospitals from Prospect in June 2024, but struggled to lure investors to back the bonds needed to finance the $80 million sale and additional cash injections required by Neronha’s office. 
The Atlanta nonprofit’s lack of hospital experience was a concern among credit rating agencies ahead of its bond issuance. Federal budget cuts under the One Big Beautiful Big Act have worsened outlooks and heightened risks for health care facilities nationwide. 
Centurion executives and attorneys insisted the nonprofit was making “progress” on its financing plan while Neronha’s office eased up on the state’s financial requirements. But the 100,000-plus creditors owed billions of dollars by Prospect signaled their unwillingness to keep bankrolling the Rhode Island hospitals to a federal bankruptcy judge in October and proposed closure.
An interim agreement provided short-term operational funding through Jan. 30, partially provided by a state-controlled escrow account. Centurion — or whoever buys the hospitals —  would be required to reimburse the state for the $12 million it provided to keep the facilities open.
Mingle said in his email to state officials that Centurion has verbal commitments from four investors whose backing will cover the “aggregate amount sufficient to facilitate the closing.” He did not respond to questions Tuesday regarding the total amount committed, the identities of the investors or why they wanted an $18 million backstop specifically.
McKee’s administration said as recently as Thursday that Centurion had yet to come forward with a concrete funding request for the state. But critics of the governor have called on him and legislative leaders to take a more proactive role in saving the hospitals, pointing to Gov. Maura Healey’s suite of state funding and incentives in 2024 to find buyers to take over the hospitals owned by Steward Health Care after it filed for bankruptcy.
Brad Dufault, a spokesperson for the United Nurses and Allies Professionals, which represents more than 1,500 workers across both hospitals, reiterated the call to state leaders Tuesday, asking them to “do whatever it takes to keep these important community hospitals open.”
“We are calling on state leaders to move quickly, pass this legislation, and save these important community hospitals,” Dufault said in a statement. “This is the quickest and possibly only way to get this deal done in the next six weeks.”

Rep. Tim Walburg, R-Madison, introduced both bills, which the Health and Human Services Committee endorsed and sent to the House of Representatives.
The first bill would create legal protections for registered nurses and licensed practical nurses who provide care in the back of an ambulance.

Nurse licenses typically allow them to practice emergency medicine, but this legislation would protect them from civil liability while practicing within their scope of care in an ambulance.
It’s especially necessary in rural areas, where nurses take on many duties, according to Walburg.
“A lot of these nurses that are in the nursing home do transfer their own patients to the hospitals when needed,” Walburg said. “What better way to give a good continuum of care or handoff to that hospital than to hear from that nurse that has been caring for this patient?”
When an ambulance doesn’t have advanced medical personnel, the law would allow for the service to use a registered nurse. It would give services more freedom, said Linda Young, executive director of the South Dakota Board of Nursing.
“Nurses have been providing emergency services throughout many, many, many years, in emergency rooms, on air ambulances,” Young said. “This bill really does allow them greater flexibility to allow for those nurses to provide care on a ground ambulance.”
The second bill that passed through the committee would add firefighters and law enforcement officers to the legal definition of “ambulance operator,” and would put decisions about who can drive ambulances in the hands of local officials.
Maynard Konechne, of the South Dakota EMS Association, said emergency medical technicians too often have to drive ambulances. He said the bill would make it easier for local services to find other drivers, so EMTs can “do more of our job in the back of the ambulance, treating that patient.”
Law enforcement officers and firefighters would be able to drive an ambulance, as long as they complete CPR certification and at least six hours of training.
In his time as a Highway Patrol trooper, Rep. Jim Halverson, R-Winner, said there were many instances when the person operating the ambulance should have been administering care instead of driving.
“This is a necessary move that we make here,” he said.
As a paramedic, Rep. Eric Emery, D-Rosebud, said first responders, especially in rural areas, should work in a collaborative environment.
“Firefighters and law enforcement officers, we work all together, hand in hand,” Emery said. “It’ll put a lot of people within the EMS community here in South Dakota at ease and hopefully bring back a lot of those volunteers that had left.”
Both proposals came from a legislative summer study on emergency medical services, which was motivated in part by staffing concerns. Members of the study committee learned, for example, that the average age of an emergency medical technician in South Dakota is 51.

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/Maine Morning Star)In a change from the chamber’s initial posture, lawmakers in the Maine Senate voted Tuesday to sustain a veto from Gov. Janet Mills to keep the state’s right to repair law as it is.
The Senate voted 24-10 in favor of Mills’ veto of LD 1228, which sought to clarify certain terms, particularly in regards to cybersecurity, in the automotive right to repair law passed by citizen’s initiative in November 2023. There was no discussion on the Senate floor before the vote was taken.
Last week, the Maine House of Representatives voted 96-44 to override the veto, reiterating the chamber’s support of the bill. Overriding a veto requires the support of two-thirds of present members of both chambers. Although the House met that threshold, the Senate did not, so the bill is now dead.
Originally, the vast majority of the House (135-12) and Senate (21-14) backed the bill.
The successful 2023 ballot referendum required certain vehicle manufacturers to standardize their diagnostic systems and make them accessible to both owners and independent repair facilities in Maine. 
In a Jan. 7 veto letter, Mills said she rejected LD 1228 because she believes it harms local auto repair shops and veers too far from the intent of the law passed by voters. Though the bill would implement a series of recommendations to clarify and improve the effectiveness of the right to repair law, Mills took issue with what she described as a “controversial provision” in the proposal that would allow manufacturers to decide how vehicle telemetric data would be accessible to independent repair shops.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/righttorepair-scaled-e1768929514594-1024x689.jpg,,,2026-01-20 12:59:25.875382

Upgrading to a premium experience at Dover Motor Speedway is about making race weekend simpler, more comfortable and more immersive.
DOVER, Del. — When the 42nd annual NASCAR All-Star Race roars into Dover Motor Speedway on Sunday May 17, fans will see the sport’s biggest names compete on the Monster Mile in a no-holds-barred showdown — and many will be doing it from some of the most premium seats and experiences the track has to offer.
Run for the first time on Dover’s one-mile concrete oval and marking the All-Star Race’s debut in the Northeast, the event is unlike any other on the NASCAR calendar. Every lap counts, restarts are critical, and the margin between Victory Lane and going home empty-handed is razor thin.
That intensity on the track is matched by a lineup of premium options at Dover Motor Speedway designed to elevate how fans experience the weekend — from luxury suites and premium dining to camping options that keep fans close to the action from start to finish.
Star power on the Monster Mile
While the final entry list will be set closer to race weekend, the NASCAR All-Star Race traditionally brings together recent race winners, past All-Star champions and fan-favorite drivers from the Cup Series. Fans can expect to see many of the sport’s biggest stars, including Kyle Larson, Chase Elliott, William Byron, Denny Hamlin, Joey Logano, Ryan Blaney, Christopher Bell and Tyler Reddick, along with contenders such as Ross Chastain, Brad Keselowski, Chris Buescher and Bubba Wallace.
With that level of talent on track, premium vantage points offer fans a front-row seat to some of the most aggressive and unpredictable racing of the season.
Velocity Suite offers an all-weekend experience
For fans looking to turn race day into a full weekend, the Velocity Suite delivers one of Dover’s most complete premium packages. Overlooking the Monster Mile, the suite provides wide views that highlight just how demanding Dover is for drivers.
The experience includes food, beverages and live race audio, along with added access and select pre-race driver appearances. With logistics handled, fans can settle in early, stay late and focus on the racing rather than managing the day.
For many fans, the Velocity Suite becomes more than just a place to watch the race — it becomes the weekend they talk about for years.
Fan Suite puts fans at the center of the action
Fans who want to feel connected to every key moment can opt for the Fan Suite, located along the frontstretch with clear views of pit road. From restarts and pit stops to late-race battles for position, this vantage point places fans in the middle of the action.
Food and drinks are included, access is simple, and once the green flag drops, there’s no need to leave. The Fan Suite is designed for fans who want premium comfort while still feeling the speed, sound and intensity of the All-Star Race.
Winner’s Circle blends comfort with full race coverage
For a more relaxed way to watch the race, the Winner’s Circle offers premium dining with views of the backstretch. Live race audio and television coverage throughout the space allow fans to follow strategy, cautions and race developments without missing a beat.
It’s a popular option for fans who want the full picture of the race while enjoying a comfortable, sit-down experience from start to finish.
Infield RESERVE delivers rare inside-the-track access
One of Dover’s most unique offerings is the Infield RESERVE, the only camping option located inside the Monster Mile. Long used by teams and drivers, the infield places fans directly within the one-mile oval for the entire race weekend.
Staying inside the track changes the rhythm of the event. Fans wake up as the Speedway comes to life, with no commuting back and forth. Services and amenities are designed to make the stay comfortable while keeping fans close to the action at all times.
For the NASCAR All-Star Race, it’s a rare opportunity to experience the event from the inside out.
Trackside camping keeps fans close all weekend

Mikie Sherrill’s actions come after she campaigned on freezing utility rates on her first day as governor. (Photo by Reena Rose Sibayan/New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Mikie Sherrill, in a bid to offset electricity price increases set to go into effect in June, ordered the Board of Public Utilities on Tuesday to expand bill credits that ratepayers saw last summer and pause proceedings that could approve new rate increases.
Sherrill signed the orders, her first as governor, on stage during her inauguration at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark. The Democrat succeeded former Gov. Phil Murphy (D) at noon on Tuesday after campaigning on a promise to order a utility rate freeze on her first day as New Jersey’s chief executive.
“I promised the people of New Jersey bold action to lower utility costs and, today, I’m delivering. Trenton will no longer accept the status quo and kick the can down the road while New Jersey families pay higher bills — not on my watch,” she said in a statement.
State reserves will ease new governor’s budget decisions

It’s unclear how much the credits will shave off ratepayer bills, though their amount is expected to vary depending on a ratepayer’s electricity usage.
The credits would be at least partially funded through a state fee on electricity suppliers unable to meet New Jersey’s renewables standards and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade program that auctions off emission allowances to fossil fuel plants.
Their total cost is unclear. When Murphy unveiled the bill credits to offset energy rate increases last year, they provided ratepayers with $100, plus an additional $150 for low-income utility customers. Murphy administration officials said his program was expected to cost about $430 million. The cost for Sherrill’s credits will likely be far higher.
Her first order directs the Board of Public Utilities to issue its first wave of credits by July 1, 2026.
Other provisions of her order require the board to weigh reducing the societal benefits charge — a 3% surcharge on all New Jersey electricity bills — and retooling the state’s Clean Energy Program to focus on ratepayer relief and energy efficiency programs.
“I’ve heard you, New Jersey: We’re facing an affordability crisis, and you want costs to come down, and you want that to begin today. You don’t want a strongly worded letter, you don’t want a 10- year study, and you don’t want empty words. In short, you are sick of the status quo,” Sherrill said during his inaugural address. “Well, guess what, guys, so am I.”
Other provisions direct regulators to study changes to utilities’ business models.
New Jersey’s regulated utilities — power companies like PSE&G or Jersey Central Power & Light — do not profit off the sale of electricity, which they pass along to customers at cost, but they are permitted to earn a set return on capital investments for transmission and other infrastructure.
In New Jersey, that return on equity is typically about 10%. Regulators could lower those rates in response to Sherrill’s order, which, among other things, asks the Board of Public Utilities to consider multi-year rate plans and additional state review for some transmission projects.
Electricity prices in New Jersey and along the 13-state grid run by PJM Interconnection have soared in recent years as artificial intelligence data centers’ electricity demands squeezed supply after years of low load growth.
The increases include hikes of roughly 20% that went into effect last June as a result of price-setting capacity auctions held by PJM. Another round of increases from more recent capacity auctions is set to take effect in June.
A second order Sherrill signed Tuesday calls on the Board of Public Utilities to speed solicitations for new solar and storage projects and orders a slew of state agencies to identify regulations that could slow the deployment of new power generation for the governor to waive.
“These executive orders will deliver relief to consumers and stop rate hikes, so New Jerseyans aren’t facing ever-increasing electric bills. This will also create the conditions to massively expand New Jersey’s power generation, because more power in-state will help lower costs,” Sherrill said.
It requires the board to develop a policy to identify duplicate interconnection requests filed by large power users, like data centers, filed across states. Some critics have charged that duplicate requests result in phantom demand that bloats load forecasts and increases electricity prices.
It also directs the Department of Environmental Protection to take all steps needed to speed permitting for capacity upgrades, emissions reductions, and efficiency improvements at New Jersey’s gas plants.

(Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)A bill to ban the sale of marijuana-like products to minors could sail through the South Dakota Senate without debate.
Senate Bill 45 would add delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinolic acid to the list of hemp-derived intoxicants illegal to purchase for people younger than 21. The bill, proposed by Attorney General Marty Jackley, would amend a law that already bars the sale of other hemp-derived compounds that create a marijuana-like high, among them Delta-8, Delta-10, THC-O acetate and hexahydrocannabinol.
The sale of such products to minors, under the terms of the bill, would be a class 1 misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine. That’s the same level of criminal offense affixed to the sale of alcohol to minors.
Possession of the hemp-derived products by a minor would be a class 2 misdemeanor, which is the lowest level of criminal offense in South Dakota law with a potential 30-day jail sentence and $500 fine.
Law banning sale of some near-pot products takes effect, but won’t prevent every legal high

Jackley initially proposed felony penalties for retailers who sell to minors, but he told the Senate Judiciary Committee that discussions with defense lawyers and business leaders convinced him to ask for an amendment to put violations on par with alcohol sales.
There were concerns about the implications of felony charges for businesses with beer or liquor licenses, Jackley said.
“I think this is an appropriate response,” he told the committee. “And like always, we hope this has a deterrent value.”
The committee first approved Jackley’s amendment, then approved the bill, with unanimous support from all members present. No one testified in opposition, clearing a path for the bill to appear on the Senate’s consent calendar.
Bills on the consent calendar are passed in bulk with a single vote and no debate in the chamber, unless a lawmaker requests that a bill be pulled out for discussion.
Changing landscape for hemp
Lawmakers in Pierre passed a bill in 2024 that makes it a class 2 misdemeanor for anyone to sell — but not to possess — products containing intoxicating, hemp-derived substances, which have exploded in popularity in recent years thanks in part to a 2018 federal farm bill that legalized hemp.
The hemp plant is related to marijuana, but contains far less THC, a compound whose Delta-9 version is responsible for the high produced by the consumption of marijuana.
Hemp products will be ‘ripped away’ by federal legislation, SD businesses fear

Once hemp became legal to sell at the federal level through the farm bill, companies began distilling CBD, a non-intoxicating substance present in hemp, to produce THC derivatives like Delta-8 and hemp-derived Delta-9, the latter of which is chemically indistinguishable from traditional marijuana’s marquee intoxicant.
Hemp-derived intoxicants are now found in vape pens, gummies and smokable hemp, similar to traditional marijuana. 
Delta-9 THC drinks are among the more visible signs of the products’ popularity, available at bars and some grocery and liquor stores in South Dakota. Backers of the 2024 bill banning the sale of hemp-derived THC products said at the time that the beverages are outside the scope of the ban because their THC isn’t chemically extracted. 
States across the U.S., South Dakota among them, have grappled with regulations for hemp-based products. On the federal level, lawmakers in Washington passed a bill that’s set to redefine hemp to exclude any product with too much THC, and to limit the amount of THC in individual products to 0.4 milligrams per serving by Nov. 13. 
For context, a low-dose Delta-9 drink contains between 2.5 to 5 milligrams per serving, and 10 milligram versions are frequently found alongside them in grocery and liquor stores.
Lawmakers in both the U.S. House and U.S. Senate, including Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, have proposed legislation pushing back the implementation of the new federal rules until 2028. 
Industry analysts said last year that the law change would wipe out 95% of the $28.4 billion hemp industry. South Dakota businesses said the new federal rules would rip away access to products that “consumers said loud and clear that they want.”
Back in South Dakota, Piedmont state Sen. John Carley, a Republican, has introduced a bill to ban the sale, production, possession or use of any hemp-derived intoxicant, using the 0.4 milligram intoxicant limit used by Congress, unless the user has a medical marijuana card. A hearing on that bill is scheduled for Wednesday morning in the Senate Health and Human Services Committee.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-20 17:08:10+00:00,CT Mirror,Public defenders are in short supply in CT. Would a raise help?,Josie Reich,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/public-defenders-are-in-short-supply-in-ct-would-a-raise-help/,"As a state commission is poised to appoint CT's next chief public defender Tuesday, the office faces staffing challenges amid low pay rates.","Public defense lawyers in Connecticut are stretched thin. 
For years, the Office of the Chief Public Defender has been lobbying for higher pay for contract attorneys who handle criminal and child welfare cases, known as assigned counsel. The legislature approved incremental raises in 2023 and 2025. But the rates remain below those offered by other New England states and below the Connecticut federal rate.
“You can’t make a living off of it, that’s for sure,” said James Pastore, the lead public defender for Fairfield County.
Lawyers who take on assigned counsel work say they’re overburdened, and OCPD has seen backlogs and case delays due to the lack of attorneys. Recent pay bumps have stirred some interest, OCPD said, but the office is still facing an attorney shortage.
And pay rates are even lower for child protection cases. OCPD failed to meet its own standards for protecting children — including missing home welfare visits — due to the lack of attorneys for children, a December 2024 report released by the Office of the Child Advocate found.
The Connecticut legislature has wrestled with competing priorities in funding the public defender’s office. In an effort to ease the burden on contract attorneys, the division advocated for additional hiring of translators and social workers. The legislature granted that request while denying the agency funding to hire social workers it needs to complete mandated child welfare visits.
And in the 2023 budget bill, the state increased access to public defender services by raising the income threshold for individuals to qualify, from $30,120 annually to $37,650. That drove up the number of clients seeking representation from an already-shrinking number of counsel available. 
State Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, who co-leads the legislature’s Appropriations Committee, said she believes there’s more to be done to strengthen staffing for public defender services. 
“I don’t think we’ve yet addressed that issue at all,” she said, referring specifically to the low pay rates for child welfare cases. She cited spending constraints this past year and said she expects lawmakers will address child protection rates in the next budget discussions.
How we got here
The state’s attorney’s office relies on assigned counsel. They’re necessary in cases with multiple defendants, when a conflict of interest would arise if the same office represented them all.
For example, Fairfield County attorney Pastore explained, “if there are three people who go into a store to rob it, what happens if one guy says ‘don’t look at me, it was the other guy?’ Someone needs to defend those people,” he said, and “it can be difficult sometimes to find people to represent those conflict clients.” 
Assigned counsel often represent especially vulnerable clients, including low-income people, abused and neglected children, and parents losing custody of their kids. They are typically attorneys in private practice who see taking on cases for the public defender as doing a public service. They take on this work knowing it pays far less than other legal work they could be doing.
They’re paid $98 per hour for state criminal cases and $113 hourly if the case goes to trial. This rate is lower than other Connecticut offices and New England states, officials with the public defender’s office wrote in a 2023 memo to a legislative subcommittee. For comparison, hourly pay ranged from $350 to $650 for lawyers employed by Connecticut at the governor’s and attorney general’s offices. It was $158 for assigned counsel in New York, $150 in Maine, and $125 in New Hampshire, according to the memo.
The federal rate for assigned counsel is $177 per hour for non-capital criminal cases and $226 per hour for capital cases. 
“We’ve got people here in this state that are great defense lawyers, and they’d rather do that work at the federal level,” OCPD’s legal counsel director Deborah Del Prete Sullivan testified at an Appropriations Committee hearing last year. “They’re very qualified people, so we’ve lost people because of that.”
How did compensation for state contract attorneys get this bad? Over 15 years, there were no meaningful rate increases while inflation degraded the pay. Attorneys stopped taking cases. 
“As the list of attorneys declined, we had to give more assignments to existing ones,” which made the job even more unattractive, acting chief public defender John Day told the Connecticut Mirror.
The problem came to a head in 2023 when the agency considered legal action if the state didn’t include raises for public defenders in the budget. The legislature partially funded the agency’s request, but rates remained prohibitively low.
In 2025, after further appeals from the office, the legislature passed an additional 11% pay increase for assigned counsel. That brought the rates to their current level. 
The agency’s staffing struggles come on the backdrop of a tumultuous few years for OCPD. Connecticut’s first Black chief public defender, TaShun Bowden-Lewis, was fired in 2024 after an investigation into alleged workplace misconduct.
Day has been running the agency in the interim. The state’s Public Defender Services Commission is slated to appoint a new chief public defender Jan. 20. (Osten said the vacancy at the head of the office did not affect funding discussions.)
The office’s mandate and case volume grew significantly in 2025. At the beginning of last year, the eligibility threshold to qualify for representation by a public defender was raised to 250% of the federal poverty line. Defendants now qualify if they make below $37,650 annually. OCPD hired new staff attorneys to address the influx of new clients. 
Then, during last year’s legislative session, Gov. Ned Lamont’s office proposed lowering the threshold back to 200%, which would have required OCPD to fire the attorneys they just hired. That led to a small skirmish with the governor’s office. 
The public defender’s office pushed back, and ultimately the budget passed without a change to the eligibility threshold. Day said his office has “addressed the need effectively” of the increased mandate and “things are operating smoothly.”
Children’s attorneys particularly underpaid 
The rate OCPD pays assigned counsel who take on child welfare cases is lower still, and the ranks of attorneys who take on this work has thinned. The gig pays a flat fee of $750 per case, even if it stretches out for months or years. A 11% pay hike in 2025 brought the fee to its current level.
These attorneys represent children and guardians in juvenile court cases including abuse and neglect. Some can receive slightly more on top of the flat fee — such as hourly pay for trial or home visits, better pay for termination of parental rights matters, and a higher flat rate for nonprofit firms.
The low pay has led to a decline in the number of attorneys available for child protection matters. Renee Cimino, OCPD’s delinquency defense and child protection director, told the Appropriations Committee that the number fell by 60% over a six-year period.
The list shrank from 275 assigned counsel to 87 at its lowest, as of last February, she said. As of December, there were 98 attorneys on the list, an uptick since the legislature approved raises last year, but still fewer than half the agency’s former ranks.
And the number of attorneys who actually accept cases may be even fewer, said Justine Rakich-Kelly, executive director of the Children’s Law Center of Connecticut. Attorneys don’t usually take their names off the list because it’s easier to remain on it and decline cases as they come, she said. The annual number of cases that assigned counsel decline to take has soared.
Because of the lack of attorneys for children, OCPD fell short of its own child protection standards. The agency failed to make all the child welfare visits it was expected to make, according to a report by the Office of the Child Advocate following the deaths of two children.
OCPD responded last February with an emergency plan to hire 20 social workers, tasked with supporting strained child welfare counsel by conducting in-home visits, collecting records and otherwise assisting attorneys.
But the effort was stymied when it was excluded from the most recent budget, signed into law in June 2025 by Gov. Ned Lamont. Cimino told CT Mirror the agency “did not receive a specific reason from the Legislature for why funding was not provided for the requested 20 social workers.”
OCPD instead hired six social workers, using funds from its general budget, and has amped up recruitment, an effort to respond despite the lack of funding.
What comes next
The agency says the incremental pay increases so far have helped with recruiting and retaining assigned counsel, including for child welfare cases, but more attorneys are needed.
The legislature signaled it would continue to increase pay until Connecticut catches up.
“We’ve been trying to bring those salaries up. We’re not quite there yet,” Osten said. “We want to have people stay and do the work.”
Over the next three years, OCPD has said it will request a total budget increase of $10,711,434 to ultimately settle at an hourly rate of $120 for assigned counsel — still a modest goal compared to peer states.
In the meantime, OCPD is trying to support attorneys in other ways. The agency successfully obtained funding for 13 new translator positions, one for each judicial district. The office hopes that hiring staff interpreters who speak Spanish and Portuguese, the two languages they see most often, will reduce court dates and case delays caused when court translators are unavailable.
“There is a lack of motivation to accept cases,” said Rakich-Kelly. “But the OCPD’s been doing an incredibly great job getting an increase.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0483-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-20 12:59:25.875382

At the end of 2024, lawmakers approved a slate of bills to create tax breaks for data centers on equipment, prompting an influx of data center proposals in communities across Michigan. The flood of data center deals has sparked frustration with government transparency alongside concern from residents that the resource intensive facilities will bring higher energy costs while draining water reserves. 
“Michigan families are literally paying the price for corporate land grabs,” Leonard said in a statement. “Residents should not be forced to subsidize sweetheart deals for massive data centers while their own bills skyrocket. That’s a rigged game that benefits insiders at the expense of everyday citizens. Which is not only wrong; it’s insulting.”
In response, Leonard is calling on the Legislature to repeal any existing and pending state-level subsidies, tax incentives and “preferential utility arrangements” for data centers, while placing a one-year moratorium on approval for new data center sites. During that time, lawmakers would be tasked with developing a legal framework that addresses grid reliability, ratepayer protections, land and water use and local consent.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“A temporary moratorium gives us the time to get this right and provide an open, transparent process that forces state and local governments to listen to the people,” Leonard said. “This is a chance to protect ratepayers, respect local communities, and demand transparency before any more blank checks are written.”
Also seeking the Republican gubernatorial nomination are U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, former Michigan Speaker of the House Tom Leonard, AxMITax founder Karla Wagner, Genesee County truck driver Anthony Hudson and Ralph Rebandt, a retired pastor from Oakland County.
State Rep. Jennifer Wortz (R-Quincy) has shared she will introduce Leonard’s proposed reforms in the House. Reps. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City), Erin Byrnes (D-Dearborn) and Jim DeSana (R-Ash Township) have also introduced legislation to repeal tax breaks for data centers. 
 “For too long, ratepayers have been asked to pay more without seeing better service or accountability,” Wortz said in a statement. “When families will be paying for these decisions for decades, taking a one-year pause to conduct a thorough review is just common sense” 
Alongside his proposals, Leonard launched a website with a petition calling on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the Michigan House and Senate to approve a moratorium on data centers and eliminate subsidies for these facilities.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8084495-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-20 12:59:25.875382

Julia Letlow, R-Start, speaks with reporters after qualifying for reelection in Louisiana's 5th Congressional District at the State Archives in Baton Rouge on Thursday, July 19, 2024. (Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow declared Monday morning she will enter this year’s U.S. Senate race, following a social media endorsement over the weekend from President Donald Trump.
Letlow, a 44-year-old Republican who has represented Louisiana’s 5th Congressional District since 2021, announced her candidacy against incumbent U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy at a Baton Rouge Business Report breakfast event. Cassidy has been considered a vulnerable Republican since he voted to impeach Trump for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Trump had stayed silent on the U.S. Senate race in Louisiana until Saturday night when he urged Letlow to run in a post to Truth Social.
“I know Julia well, have seen her tested at the highest and most difficult levels, and she is a TOTAL WINNER!” Trump wrote, I part. “A Proud Mother of two children, Julia is a wonderful person, has ALWAYS delivered for Louisiana, and would continue doing so in the United States Senate.”
Before being elected to Congress, Letlow was a high-ranking administrator at the University of Louisiana at Monroe. Her political ascension began when she entered a special election to the fill the 5th District vacancy left when her husband, Luke Letlow, died from complications of COVID-19 just days before he was to be sworn into office. She has since won re-election twice and holds a seat on the powerful U.S. House Appropriations Committee.
When the state legislature redrew its congressional boundaries in 2024, preserving Letlow’s seat was declared a priority among Republican leaders, who sacrificed the 6th District seat of Garret Graves, R-Baton Rouge, to create a second majority-Black district for Louisiana in the U.S. House. Portions of Graves’ old district around LSU were drawn into Letlow’s 5th District boundaries.
Letlow moved her family to Baton Rouge last year and was engaged last month to lawyer and lobbyist Kevin Ainsworth, a former baseball player at LSU.
In a statement Saturday night after the president’s endorsement of Letlow, Cassidy indicated he would remain in the race and held firm Monday morning, according to a statement he made to WVUE-TV Fox 8.
“Congresswoman Letlow called me this morning to say she was running. She said she respected me and that I had done a good job,” Cassidy said. “I will continue to do a good job when I win re-election. I am a conservative who wakes up every morning thinking about how to make Louisiana and the United States a better place to live.”
Despite his impeachment vote five years ago, Cassidy has positioned himself as a Trump loyalist. He cast the deciding vote to make Robert F. Kennedy Jr. secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, despite openly disagreeing with Kennedy’s stances on vaccines and the causes of autism.
Though he was unable to gain Trump’s backing, Cassidy has amassed a substantial campaign war chest approaching $20 million when including political action committees. He has also received endorsements from several Louisiana sheriffs, parish presidents and notable GOP donors.
The timing of Letlow’s announcement gives her a key opportunity to court campaign donors at the 77th Washington Mardi Gras, set for Jan. 28-Feb. 1 in the nation’s capital. The event typically includes several fundraisers for Louisiana candidates at all levels, as well as parties hosted by corporate interests and political organizations.
For the first time since 1975, Louisiana will hold closed party primaries for its elections. Other announced Republican candidates for Cassidy’s seat include state Rep. Julie Emerson, Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming, state Sen. Blake Miguez and PublicService Commissioner Eric Skrmetta. Official qualifying for the May 16 primary election takes place Feb. 11-13.

Noem argued that those facilities are therefore exempt from unannounced oversight visits by members of Congress. House Democrats who sued include Joe Neguse of Colorado, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Robert Garcia of California, J.

“We are all united in advocating for working conditions that support advanced practice providers and prioritize safe patient care,” Pam Stave, a physician assistant, said in a press release from the Michigan Nurses Association. “Without a union, we would have no power to stop management from freezing our pay or doing whatever else they want. Now, we get to bring our collective power to the bargaining table and really make a difference for ourselves and our patients.”
The press release added that the health care providers in the union were disappointed with the hospital management’s behavior during their attempts to unionize, stating that those involved were threatened with denied pay increases and pulled into one-on-one meetings with the seeming intention to dissuade them from voting for the union’s formation. 
“We respect the rights of our Advanced Practice Providers to bargain collectively and look forward to working with them in the future for the betterment of our patients and community,” John Foren, spokesman for the regional health system, said in a statement. 
This union is not the first at Sparrow under the Michigan Nurses Association. Jeff Breslin, president of the Professional Employee Council of Sparrow Hospital-Michigan Nurses Association, expressed his support for the new bargaining unit in the press release. 
“We all share a common purpose, which is to provide the best care possible to our patients and our community,” Breslin said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/UMSparrowDronePic6-1024x548.png,,,2026-01-20 11:57:57.821183

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Satanic Grotto delivered a complaint to the Kansas Department of Administration Capitol events coordinator for allowing Abortion is Murder — a Christian group known for protesting with graphic signs — to protest inside the Statehouse, and plans to counterprotest.
Satanic Grotto president Michael Stewart said the grotto plans to be at the Statehouse on Jan. 27, the day of the AIM protest, with or without permit approval. Stewart said the approval of AIM’s permit is unfair because the state, which restricted a planned grotto protest over the summer, is applying different standards about obscenity and violence to the two groups.
The grotto identifies its complaint as a “formal notice of liability” for discrimination.

Stewart invited people to join the grotto in counterprotesting AIM, offering free kazoos as an incentive. Stewart said he submitted a permit for the protest Jan.15, and it has yet to be approved or denied. Stewart said the Department of Administration uses silence as a “disruption tactic.”
Samir Arif, the chief of staff and director of public affairs for the Department of Administration, said the agency wouldn’t comment on ongoing legal issues.
As of Jan. 20, about 50 people were “interested” in or going to the grotto’s counterprotest, according to a Facebook event listing.
Stewart said the Grotto’s permit application is for the south steps outside of the Statehouse. AIM’s permit is for the second floor rotunda inside.
“Our actions at the Capitol will be in direct response to the government’s decisions,” Stewart said. “If the government fulfills their duties, then the grotto will be committed to having a peaceful celebration of bodily autonomy and educating anyone who shows up about their personal constitutional rights outside, right along AIM.
“If we are institutionally oppressed, or if they show a viewpoint discrimination favoring AIM, then we will absolutely escalate our actions to an interior counterprotest. The grotto doesn’t want the conflict. The grotto wants equal treatment in the same space.”
Stewart said grotto artists have made a “poignant gore piece” to bring to the counterprotest. The 9-foot-tall sculpture has been named “zombie Jesus” by members.
He said the rules for permits are unfairly applied. Before the grotto’s own protest in March — a “black mass” that drew thousands of Christian counterprotesters and ended with a handful of arrests — legislators denounced their plans with House Resolution 6016, which called the plan “blasphemous.” Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly banned the satanists from entering the Statehouse, but they ignored her ban.
The black mass turned violent as Christian counterprotesters clashed with Satanic Grotto members. Stewart and a counterprotester were arrested.
After the black mass, Adam Proffitt, the secretary of administration, denied the grotto’s application for another protest over the summer. Proffitt said the grotto could have a permit if someone other than Stewart filed for it, and as long as the protest didn’t go past sundown. The group obliged.

Stewart said the group filed the AIM counterprotest permit under the same parameters.
Denying AIM’s permit would have been “the perfect opportunity, I think, to exercise those rules outside of the grotto so that there’s no discrimination on their part,” Stewart said.
In the grotto’s complaint, Stewart pointed to the Statehouse usage policy restricting activities deemed “indecent or obscene.”
“If the Statehouse interior is designated a ‘Gore-Permissive Zone’ for AIM Kansas, the Grotto Society Inc. will provide its own depictions of visceral occult gore,” Stewart wrote in the complaint.
The complaint also noted the anti-abortion movement’s long history of violence in Kansas, from 2,600 arrests during the 1991 “summer of mercy” to arson and car bombings to the murder of physician George Tiller at his church in 2009.
AIM did not respond to Kansas Reflector’s requests for comment. 
“We will hear from many pastors from around the state, we will set up meetings with our legislators, we will sing hymns, chant chants, and call the world to repent of their apathy for the genocide we all live in,” AIM’s website reads. “And we will go every year, preach every month, demand justice every day until abortion is abolished.”
Despite Kansans’ 2022 landslide vote to protect abortion rights, this summer’s vote on whether to elect Kansas Supreme Court justices could lead to a reversal of that decision.
Following the 2022 vote, and the U.S. Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade, Kansas has recorded a rise in abortions from out-of-state patients. Last year, there were 19,811 total abortions in Kansas, up from 7,849 in 2021.
Last year’s numbers include seven in-state and 28 out-of-state patients between the ages of 10 and 14 who terminated their pregnancy.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Stewart-punch-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-20 11:57:57.821183

It's very important.”Trump said he plans to talk with people living in Greenland when asked about residents not wanting to become part of the United States.“I haven’t spoken to them,” Trump said. “When I speak to them, I’m sure they’ll be thrilled.”Trump posts about Greenland repeatedlyTrump posted on social media numerous times earlier Tuesday and throughout the weekend, pressing other leaders to help him secure Greenland, despite ongoing opposition. “I had a very good telephone call with Mark Rutte, the Secretary General of NATO, concerning Greenland,” Trump posted at 12:26 a.m. “I agreed to a meeting of the various parties in Davos, Switzerland. As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security. There can be no going back — On that, everyone agrees!” Trump posted an altered image of him showing a map to European leaders that had a version of the U.S. flag covering Canada, Greenland and Venezuela.

""Because, you know, Emmanuel is not going to be there very long and, you know, there's no longevity there. He's a friend of mine. He's a nice guy. I like Macron. But he's not going to be there very much longer as you know.

These are International Powers who only recognize STRENGTH, which is why the United States of America, under my leadership, is now, after only one year, respected like never before,” Trump added. “The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.

GOV. MAURA HEALEY announced this month that the state would use $250 million from a state trust fund to assist some Massachusetts residents who have lost enhanced federal subsidies to pay for health care coverage. The Affordable Care Act tax credits were rolled out under the Biden administration during the pandemic through the American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA. They made it easier for people at more moderate income levels to access subsidized care.
But those credits expired at the end of 2025, with Republican resistance to extending them central to the government shutdown last year.  
They may yet return, as there is some bipartisan support for the tax credits in the House, but the Senate still seems cool to the idea. In the meantime, some states have moved to fill the funding gap. In Massachusetts, Healey said the state will cover $250 million that had come from the federal government through ARPA by tapping the Commonwealth Care Trust Fund, a state account that draws on several revenue streams.

Tate Reeves speaks during the Mississippi Economic Council's annual Hobnob at the Mississippi Coliseum in Jackson on Thursday, Oct. 30, 2025.","The audio version of this story is AI generated and is not human reviewed. It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Mississippi will soon be able to get a break on their taxes for contributing to private-school scholarships, thanks to a federal program. 
Gov. Tate Reeves announced Monday that he had opted the state into the program. It’s a win for school-choice proponents, as Mississippi lawmakers continue to debate the policy on the state level. 
School choice — policies aimed at giving families more educational options, often funding those choices with public money —  is the top issue of the current legislative session, led by House Speaker Jason White. Both chambers have passed school-choice bills, but Senate leaders have firmly taken a stance against programs that send public dollars to private schools, as the federal tax-credit program does. 
School-choice proponents say the policies give parents more control over their children’s education. Opponents argue that they siphon money away from the public education system, which is required to serve every child.
“Mississippi believes that parents – not government – know what’s best for their children’s education,” Reeves said in his announcement. 
The federal tax-credit program, created by President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” allows Mississippians to contribute up to $1,700 to an organization that awards scholarships to private-school students, starting in federal tax year 2027. Donors will be given a break on their taxes equal to the amount they contribute — that’s called a dollar-for-dollar tax credit, and it’s about three times as much as people receive from donating to a children’s hospital or other causes. 
To qualify for these scholarships, one can earn up to 300% of the area’s median income. That’s six-figures in Mississippi, or about $150,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. 
Research shows a majority of private-school vouchers across the country go to students who could already afford and were attending private schools. 
In the coming months, Reeves’ office will designate eligible scholarship-granting organizations — groups that will disburse these vouchers, whose sole purpose must be doing so — to participate in the program.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/30124019/Mississippi-Economic-Council-annual-Hobnob24.jpg,,,2026-01-20 11:57:57.821183

The bills would also establish the crime of “grooming a minor,” defined in the legislation as a pattern of behavior by an adult intended to prime a child to be sexually exploited. That behavior would not have to include a sexual act and could consist entirely of verbal or digital communication.
State Rep. Holly Jones, a Republican from Eureka and chair of the House Children and Families Committee, told The Independent the bills resulted from collaboration between the various sponsors that date back several years.
“Child abuse, familial abuse, trafficking, all of that is bipartisan,” Jones said. 
Lawmakers expressed broad support for the bills during a hearing of the committee Tuesday but signaled they would further discuss how the legislation defines “grooming” and the possibility of adding training to help parents and educators identify predatory behavior toward young people.
The package consists of two pairs of identical bills. Two anti-trafficking bills, sponsored by Republican state Reps. Ed Lewis of Moberly and Jeff Myers ofWarren, are similar to legislation that passed in the House last year and advanced out of committee in the Senate.
Bills that would criminalize predatory behavior toward children that stops short of sex are sponsored by Republican state Reps. Burt Whaley of Clever and Christopher Warwick of Bolivar.
 Human trafficking

Under the bills sponsored by Lewis and Myers, trafficking of a child by their parent or guardian would carry a penalty of life imprisonment. Survivors of child sex trafficking would have up to 20 years after turning 21 to claim damages for their abuse rather than 10.
That legislation would also allow any Missourian convicted of prostitution to apply to a court to clear their records. Currently, only those who were under 18 at the time of the sexual conduct can apply for expungement.
Christine McDonald testified last week to the House committee that she was trafficked in Kansas and Oklahoma before being “bought and sold for 17 years,” from the age of 17, in Missouri. The first person who trafficked her was her mother.
McDonald, who was convicted of felony prostitution, asked lawmakers to confirm that the legislation would allow trafficking survivors to apply for expungement.
“Am I correct that’s part of this piece of legislation?” she asked, initially to silence, each refrain more insistent. “Am I correct? Am I correct?”
McDonald said that after she escaped her trafficker, the felony on her record followed her as she worked to build a new life.
“Do you understand how hard it was to find services, to find any place to give me a job?” she asked. “I had never had a job in my life. Do you know how hard it was for me to find a place to live? Nobody would rent to me. Do you know how hard it was to face anybody in the community and in church because I was a felony prostitute?”
Lawmakers said proposed legislation would move away from blaming people who are coerced into sexual encounters.
All 58 mentions of “child pornography” in current law would change to “child sexual abuse material.”

“Child sexual abuse material’ indicates what it is,” Lewis said. “If a person is under the age of 18, if they’re 17 and under, they cannot provide consent.”
The law would seek to quash demand by making it a felony to pay for sex. The maximum penalty for buying sex with a teen aged 15 to 18 would increase from four to seven years in prison. Buying sex with someone under 15 carries a sentence of five to 15 years.
Myers highlighted the importance of the training his bill would mandate for first responders. He said anti-trafficking training he took as a state trooper made him realize cases he might have missed.
“I realized I had cases like these before,” Myers said. “I just didn’t realize what I was looking at.”
Under the bill, emergency medical technicians, peace officers, social workers, prosecuting attorneys and juvenile officers would have to complete annual training on sex and human trafficking.
 Protecting young people

More than one lawmaker teared up as survivors and family members testified about how adults they had trusted manipulated and abused them or their loved ones.
Jeff Dixon carried a thick binder to the witness table containing “a third of the 17,000 text messages” he said were sent to his two teen daughters by their Taekwondo instructor. The messages included photographs showing the results of a “bruising game” the man used to engage in with the young women, Dixon said.
Evelyn Dixon spoke about how the instructor cultivated her trust, complimenting her martial arts technique and confiding about his personal life before pressuring her to run away with him to Florida.
“I wasn’t able to process anything, and the things that would usually send me running didn’t seem to matter anymore,” she said.
Her father said state law should punish adults whose exploitation of minors doesn’t include sex.
“That’s why this bill is important, is because everything he did, because there was no rape, there’s no dirty pictures, there’s no sex, everything he did was legal,” Dixon said.
Missouri law already includes the crime of “enticement of a child” through words, actions or communication “for the purpose of engaging in sexual conduct.”
Warwick said the intent of the proposed legislation is to more explicitly lay out what constitutes a predatory pattern of behavior. While current law “takes care of once a sexual act is actually committed against a minor,” he said, “what’s not being done is content that is being introduced.”
The proposed legislation would make it a felony to engage in “grooming,” with a minimum sentence of five years in prison.
State Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson, expressed lawmakers’ support for survivors who testified.
“We have your back on this committee,” she said. “We don’t play at all.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_3446-1024x614.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 11:57:57.821183

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A key finance panel on Tuesday inserted a one-year state income tax break on overtime and tips for Hoosier workers.
The amendment would cost the state $251 million in tax revenue and that loss would be covered by the growing state surplus, said Sen. Travis Holdman, R-Markle.
“This would be for just one year until we see if we can actually afford to go forward. And folks, this would come out of the reserves that we have accumulated at the state level,” Holdman said.
Lawmakers will decide during budget negotiations in 2027 whether to make it permanent.
Holdman, who chairs the Senate Tax and Fiscal Policy Committee, said it applies to 2026 wages on tax returns filed in 2027.
The amendment was inserted into Senate Bill 243, which passed 11-1. It now moves to the Senate floor.
Sen. Andrea Hunley, D-Indianapolis, voted against the bill after noting that Indiana continues to have a tax on period products even though it would cost the state only $5 million.
The amendment would couple Indiana’s tax code to federal tax code with regard to no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and no tax on loan interest for American-made vehicles passed in the One Big Beautiful Bill that President Donald Trump pushed through Congress last summer.
But it also cuts close to opening the current two-year budget, which Gov. Mike Braun and Republican legislative leaders have said they wouldn’t do.
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray applauded the bill.
“These state income tax cuts are a concrete way we can help hardworking Hoosiers keep more of their hard-earned money,” Bray said. “These cuts come on the heels of our strong track record of cutting taxes. Statehouse Republicans have cut taxes more than 20 times in 10 years, the income tax rate dropped yet again on Jan. 1 of this year, and this year two-thirds of Hoosiers are expected to see a property tax bill lower than their 2025 bill following a historic property tax relief package resulting in $1.3 billion in property tax relief over the next three years.”
An analysis from Braun’s administration estimated that total state tax breaks on businesses and individuals from tax conformity could top $900 million over the next two years if the Legislature were to fully conform the state tax code with the federal changes.
The Senate already passed Senate Bill 212 to adopt a few of the federal tax breaks that would apply this tax season. This includes strengthening the state adoption tax credit.
The House is expected to take that legislation up quickly and send it to Braun for his signature.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_0626-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 10:59:51.868318

This image of Johnston is of her at a Board of Regents meeting in 2024 in Manhattan. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Board of Regents ordered state public universities to implement faculty workload and tenure review policies that will bring underperforming professors to remediation, with termination a potential consequence for failure to address deficiencies.
The mandate applied to thousands of faculty employed at Kansas State University, the University of Kansas, Pittsburg State University, Fort Hays State University, Emporia State University and Wichita State University. Expectations for nontenure, tenure-track and tenured faculty wouldn’t be identical from university to university, but all would be assigned annual course instructional loads and undergo yearly reviews in terms of teaching, research and public service.
Faculty at the state’s three research-oriented universities — KU, K-State and WSU — would be expected to teach six to nine credit hours per semester. Annual reviews of these faculty would be based on teaching at 40% to 55% of the workload. Research obligations would range from 35% to 45% of the total. Public service would be 5% to 20% of the job.
Faculty at the three regional universities — PSU, ESU and FHSU — would be assigned 12 credit hours of instructional course work each semester. The faculty evaluation breakdown: teaching, 60% to 75%; research, 15% to 30%; and public service, 5% to 20%.
Tenured university faculty in the Board of Regents system would undergo performance assessments by a campus committee every five years. Those determined to be less than satisfactory would be placed on self-improvement plans. If a faculty member earned a second unsatisfactory annual review, the policy said, the individual would be subject to dismissal, reassignment or other personnel action.
Rusty Monhollon, vice president of academic affairs for the Board of Regents, said the post-tenure and workload policies would help administrators identify faculty falling short of standards and those exceeding those metrics. The goal was to make evaluation of faculty less subjective and to address consternation about the rigor of decisions about faculty appointments, he said.
He expected few university faculty to fail to abide by new productivity standards because the “work they do is good.”
“These are very important policies that are impactful. We want to make sure we get it right,” said Alysia Johnston, a member of the Board of Regents.
Johnston, a former president of Fort Scott Community College, said the final version of policies approved by the Board of Regents left the analysis of tenure review cases to university administrators because the state board didn’t have the expertise to make scholarly judgments. She said the Board of Regents would consider tenure appeals based on claims that due process rights were violated by university administrators.
The Board of Regents voted unanimously at its January meeting to require the six universities to begin documenting and reporting faculty performance data that would be shared with legislators and others to enhance transparency and accountability in higher education.
University reporting would include statistics on student credit hours produced, percentage of credit hours by full-time faculty, bachelor’s degrees awarded, student retention, faculty scholarship and faculty research funding. Information about the number of people granted and denied tenure and the number of faculty who left each university must be documented.
Board of Regents member Matt Crocker, a Manhattan businessman, said he appreciated that the development of a systemwide faculty review policy involved considerable effort by the Board of Regents. He said there was an expectation among members of the Kansas Legislature that faculty workload policies would be rigorous. In the past two years, members of the Legislature raised the possibility of modifying tenure at the state universities.
“The question I seem to get all the time, especially here in Topeka, is making sure I’m a good steward for the state’s funding for higher education,” he said.
Under the Board of Regents policy, each university would craft faculty workload expectations that were “equitable, fair and balanced, and aligned with the unique needs of each department and the whole institution.” While all faculty would be assigned teaching loads, the policy said, exceptions would be permitted for clinical or research faculty, librarians and other personnel in noninstructional roles.
The new systemwide policy was developed by Board of Regents’ staff, university administrators and faculty as well as state politicians. At least four drafts were circulated for review and comment during the past seven months.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alysia-Johnston-board-of-regents-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-20 10:59:51.868318

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)The weekend of Jan. 10, my sister and I went past the Roundhouse in Santa Fe to check out a protest dubbed ICE OUT FOR GOOD. It was a beautiful cold day after our first snow and folks were out on the sidewalk demanding to have their voices heard. There were costumes and American flags and handmade signs that were earnest and forceful and witty and rude. I saw a giant Elmo jubilantly making his way through the crowd. The people in attendance were incensed by the Jan. 7 execution of Renee Good by the hands of ICE agents in Minneapolis. 
Yet the protest left me with one big question: What does the demand ICE OUT FOR GOOD realistically mean in New Mexico? The federal government has broad legal latitude to send ICE agents into states and cities. Sanctuary and Welcoming City designations do not prohibit ICE from being in our communities; they just limit the capacity of our local and statewide agencies to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. As any political leader will tell you, solutions to the question of how to keep ICE out of our cities have never been easy to come by and would inevitably face constitutional scrutiny. 
But political pressure is mounting. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey publicly demanded that ICE leave Minneapolis and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is also standing strong against their presence. The states of Illinois and Minnesota recently sued in federal court to block the government from deploying federal agents to their cities. All three of New Mexico’s representatives to Congress signed impeachment papers for Kristi Noem. Whether any of this will generate sincere power to disrupt the Department of Homeland Security’s plans remains an open question.
I do think there is value in people showing up in numbers to shout and wave signs as a show of public values. But I prefer demonstrations that are a little disobedient or  disrupt something or come with a threat of action. What will we do if our political leaders do not support our demands? Are we prepared to vote out Democrats who don’t stand up to ICE? Are we prepared to plan civil disobedience actions that disrupt life in New Mexico or our economy? These are the questions I ask myself when I think about how to generate power to confront this threat. 
The New Mexico legislative session starts this week. There are going to be several bills aimed at protecting non-citizens and challenging ICE’s ability to operate with impunity in our state. One such bill is known as the Immigrant Safety Act. It would prohibit public entities, like our counties, from contracting with ICE to house immigrant detainees in the state. It would not be an outright ban but it would create new and  significant challenges for the federal government to maintain immigration detention in our state. Advocates have been pushing this legislation for years at the Roundhouse and it has always fallen short. 2026 needs to be the year when it crosses the finish line. 
It’s time to pay attention. I have seen plenty of people raising their voices, so to speak, on social media and I have been in rooms full of people who are begging to know what they can do to help protect our non-citizen neighbors. In the coming weeks, we must show up and demand that our political leaders support every bill that challenges ICE’s presence in our state and seeks to protect our non-citizen neighbors. We need to make them worry about their jobs if they don’t. 
Pay attention to the voice of people at organizations like Somos Un Pueblo Unido, New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, El Centro de Igualdad y Derechos, Contigo Immigrant Justice, Innovation Law lab, the Semilla Project, Semilla Action, CAFé Accion and the ACLU of New Mexico. You may be new to the fight for immigrant justice in New Mexico. They are not. They have powerful ideas rooted in the realities of the communities they work in. 
Getting ICE OUT FOR GOOD is going to take creativity and sacrifice and the political courage of our elected leaders. It will be a long and slow fight, even as the pain of Renee Good’s murder recedes from our collective memories. We must follow the lead of the  brilliant advocates in our state who have been fighting for the safety of our immigrant families. And if we do, as New Mexicans, we have a chance in this legislative session to take powerful and concrete steps to exert our state power. And then we have to keep going.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2992-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 10:59:51.868318
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-20 15:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,NYC is testing guaranteed income for homeless youths,Haidee Chu | THE CITY,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/nyc-is-testing-guaranteed-income-for-homeless-youths/,"An ambitious experiment to give young people money and trust them to spend it well shows promising early signs, participants say.","What can a $1,200 monthly allowance do for young adults experiencing homelessness? 
In The Bronx, a 22-year-old said she is finally able to save up for a rent security deposit for the first time since entering the shelter system a year and a half ago. 
In Harlem, a 19-year-old Lehman College student said her dream of pursuing a cosmetology license finally feels within reach.
New York City is home to more than 6,800 homeless youths who are not in the physical custody of a parent or guardian, and who either live on the streets or are sheltered in temporary settings. Since December, 60 of them — aged 18 through 24 — have been receiving monthly cash payments of $1,200 after they were selected at random to participate in a program called “Cash for Care,” run in partnership with Covenant House New York, a non-profit service and shelter provider for homeless and runaway youths.
The $1.5 million initiative, funded by the City Council under the leadership of former speaker Adrienne Adams, also provides recipients with a one-time lump sum of $5,000 — accessible at any time during the program — in addition to the monthly payments. The program includes services such as help with financial planning, housing searches and career development, and will run through this June. 
The Covenant House youth shelter in Hell’s Kitchen helped connect young people with employers, Jan. 8, 2026.
The program was introduced in collaboration with policy research center Chapin Hall to test whether a guaranteed income can help youths transition out of homelessness. The idea, which has gained some nationwide traction in recent years, is to simply give people cash and let them decide what to do with it.
The new project builds on the research center’s “Trust Youth Initiative”, which was launched during the pandemic in June 2021 and also offered monthly stipends to a few dozen homeless young people in the city. 
More than 90% of participants in the 2021 initiative said the monthly stipends helped them find stable housing. The current iteration, though, is looking to reassess the efficacy of the payments in light of dramatic rent increases and rollbacks in emergency rental assistance in the years that followed, said Chapin Hall policy fellow Sarah Berger Gonzalez.
Researchers will measure outcomes in housing stability and food security through surveys and casework data among program participants, she added, and compare the results against a control group of another 60 Covenant House youths who will not receive the support. (All survey responders can earn up to around $400, depending on participation.)
So far, youth participants who spoke to THE CITY said the cash assistance has opened up new possibilities for them. Those youths spoke under the condition of anonymity to protect their privacy and to avoid conflict with other youths in the shelters who were not selected for the program.
For the 22-year-old, who currently lives in a Bronx shelter, the new stream of income means she’s now able to explore permanent housing options outside the city’s rapid re-housing program, where her application has been pending for months. 
“I’ve been in the shelter for so long, it sometimes is a little depressing, because I’m just like, ‘OK, when are they going to get back to me about this apartment?” said the 22-year-old, who has cycled in and out of youth shelters since her family was evicted from their home a year and a half ago. “Now, with this money, me and my sister are like, ‘OK, it may just be easier to get that apartment ourselves.”
A 22-year-old Covenant House participant said she’s using a cash stipend to save up for a security deposit and to enroll in a trade training program, Jan. 8, 2026.
She also plans to use the money to explore new skills, she said. She had been unable to attend cost-free training in medical billing or sterile cleaning techniques, she noted, because they conflict with her work as a sales associate at Bronx Zoo. But with the monthly stipends, she said, she can now pay out of pocket for ones that fit her schedule.
Soon, she’ll start driving lessons, too.
“The options are unlimited now,” she said.
‘Are We Crazy?’
Covenant House New York CEO Shakeema North-Albert said she wasn’t always convinced that a guaranteed income program would work when Chapin Hall initially approached her with the idea.
“Putting myself in the shoes of someone else, who’s not rich and who had to figure it out, if someone gave me $1,000 a month and said, ‘you could just do whatever you want with it,’ I probably would have blown most of it because I would have went out and got all the things I thought I was lacking,” said North-Albert. “It would have taken me maybe three months to get it figured out and say, like, “girl, you’re running out of money, you need to figure something out.’”’
Covenant House CEO Shakeema North-Albert spoke about their new program to provide cash assistance to homeless youth, Jan. 8, 2026.
But, North-Albert said, she hoped the program could nonetheless pose an opportunity to shift away from the crisis shelter model and towards innovations that could help youths transition out of homelessness entirely, looking to the Trust Youth Initiative as a model. Unlike some other guaranteed income programs, she said, that model incorporated services designed to help people find stable housing.
“The supportive services piece made it more attractive to me,” said North-Albert, who now hopes to secure more funding to scale up the program. “The youths still have the autonomy to make whatever decision they want to make, but at least we’ll help coach them and help them look at this opportunity in light of their current situation to help them get closer to whatever their goals are.”
Lyndell Pittman, the organization’s senior vice president of support services, said he initially shared similar doubts.
“Quite frankly, when [North-Albert] told me what we were doing, I was like, ‘Are we crazy?’” Pittman said. “But I got to see young people with a desire to change their situations, and willing to learn and accept the support to learn.”
Covenant House Senior Vice President of Support Services Lyndell Pittman spoke about their new program to provide cash assistance to homeless youth, Jan. 8, 2026.
Many youths, he said, talked about paying off debts and bills at the onset of the program. One youth in particular, he said, shared how the money would help get her on track to reuniting with her child, who is currently under foster care.
“I’m not at a 180 but I’m at a 160,” Pittman added, describing his change in attitude. “Watching the young people’s lightbulb come on about finances has been a real thing.”
One 19-year-old Covenant House resident told THE CITY her approach to the stipend has already shifted from when she received her first deposit last month.
“I didn’t want to save that first paycheck. I just wanted to have a bit of fun, so I bought a phone and just kind of tried new places outside,” she said. “But I met with my case manager, and she kind of encouraged me. She’s like, ‘Are you saving?’ And then I thought about it, and I also thought I should save.”
She’s currently taking a break from her studies at City College to discover more about herself and what she may want to pursue as a career, she added, and has struggled to find a job due to her mental health. 
“You don’t get money going to school, so it just felt like it wasn’t a priority right now,” she said.
The monthly allowances, meanwhile, have helped ease her financial anxieties.
Another 19-year-old, the Lehman College student, said she had initially increased her spending after the first infusion of cash, but now limits her spending to $100 or less a week and saves at least $500 from each deposit.
A 19-year-old Covenant House participant said she plans to pursue a cosmetology license with the monthly cash stipend, Jan. 8, 2026.
The steady monthly payments, she said, mean she’s no longer looking for financial support from her mother, who she said lives with alcohol dependency and kicked her out in October after an argument. Their relationship has since improved, she added, and she moved home to live with her mother a few weeks ago.
She now plans to set aside part of her monthly stipends for a cosmetology license and to buy makeup so she can begin offering workshops and classes, she said. 
She showed off her vision board for the year, and described the photos and quotes she pasted on a piece of paper: “Savings, 8 A’s, a candle, coffee, the bible, hot girls, driver’s license, and then my cosmetology license is also on there.”
“My birthday is about to come up, I’m going to be turning 20,” she continued. “And I’m trying to convert to better habits. So I’m like, ‘OK, let me lock in.’”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010826_covenant_house-3-1024x683.webp,,,2026-01-20 11:57:57.821183

Phil Murphy said one of the bills would have attracted judicial scrutiny and the other might have conflicted with federal law.,"Gov. Phil Murphy said one of the bills would have attracted judicial scrutiny and the other might have conflicted with federal law. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy, who made protecting immigrants a pillar of his first campaign for governor, used some of his final hours in office Tuesday to veto two sweeping bills designed to expand migrant rights.
The bills left unsigned would have written the attorney general’s 2018 Immigrant Trust Directive into law — the order restricts when local, county, and state police can aid federal immigration agents — and created new safeguards for sensitive personal data provided by New Jerseyans to hospitals, schools, and libraries can be shared.
Murphy, a Democrat who is leaving office at noon Tuesday after two terms as governor, said the codification bill had significant differences from the directive that made him fear it would attract renewed judicial scrutiny. The directive has stood up in court, including at the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, he noted.

“I am extremely concerned that signing this bill, which differs from the Immigrant Trust Directive, would open New Jersey up to a new court challenge and renewed judicial scrutiny from judges who may not render the same decision upholding these critical protections,” Murphy said. “Renewed litigation would also put our time-tested Immigrant Trust Directive at risk, endangering hundreds of thousands of immigrants in New Jersey in one fell swoop. I cannot in good conscience allow that to happen.”
Murphy added that while he supported the data privacy protection bill — he conditionally vetoed the measure after a voting session last week and sent it back to the Legislature for amendments that lawmakers then hastily agreed to — his team “discovered a drafting oversight that could create significant complications.” Because a new legislative session has started since the bill passed the Legislature, it’s too late to seek new changes to the measure.
“The bill as written could be construed to conflict with federal law and, if signed, could jeopardize billions of dollars in federal funding for critical programs that serve the people of New Jersey,” said Murphy. “I deeply wish there was sufficient time left to correct this issue, but it is not possible due to the expiration of the legislative session. Therefore, the only responsible option is to decline to act on the bill at this time.”
Immigrant advocates blasted Murphy for vetoing bills they said would provide vital protections for migrants amid a time of aggressive enforcement by the Trump administration. They have warned that a future attorney general could withdraw the directive at any moment.
The vetoes are known as pocket vetoes, meaning they aren’t being sent to the Legislature for a potential override because they were passed in the final days of a legislative session.
Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D), who becomes governor at noon, declined to say on the campaign trail whether she would support legislation codifying the policy, but she did express fear, like Murphy did Tuesday, that codifying the 2018 directive would open the state up to new lawsuits.
Amol Sinha, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, which supported the bills, said he is “deeply disappointed” with Murphy declining to sign two of them.
“In failing to sign these bills, Governor Murphy has left New Jersey without critical protections at a moment when ICE is brutalizing our communities. These bills were legally sound, politically viable, and commonsense policy. We call on Governor-elect Sherrill, her administration, and the Legislature to establish data privacy protections and ensure state and local resources are not commandeered for federal immigration enforcement – we have no time to waste,” Sinha said in a statement.
In his two terms at the helm of the state, Murphy was lauded as an ally to immigrants in New Jersey and worked closely with immigrant-focused organizations. He signed landmark bills greenlighting driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants, offering pandemic relief dollars to migrants who weren’t eligible for federal aid, and expanding in-state tuition to include undocumented college students.
In New Jersey, 1 in 4 residents is an immigrant, and more than 500,000 residents are estimated to be undocumented.
The two bills Murphy declined to sign were part of a three-bill package introduced earlier this month. Murphy signed the third, which requires the Attorney General’s Office to designate specific locations where immigration enforcement will be barred.
Murphy said he’s hopeful the Legislature will reintroduce the data privacy bill and pass an amended version“so it can be signed into law at the soonest opportunity.”
The three bills were introduced, advanced in committee, and approved by the Legislature in the final weeks of its last legislative session. They faced staunch Republican opposition.
Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) told reporters last week that he believed the governor would sign the bills, “and that’ll be the law.”
“Too many people are living in fear” of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement, he said.
Coughlin’s office did not comment on Murphy’s veto. Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

MAURA HEALEY announced this month that the state would use $250 million from a state trust fund to assist some Massachusetts residents who have lost enhanced federal subsidies to pay for health care coverage. The Affordable Care Act tax credits were rolled out under the Biden administration during the pandemic through the American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA. They made it easier for people at more moderate income levels to access subsidized care.  
But those credits expired at the end of 2025, with Republican resistance to extending them central to the government shutdown last year.  
They may yet return, as there is some bipartisan support for the tax credits in the House, but the Senate still seems cool to the idea. In the meantime, some states have moved to fill the funding gap. In Massachusetts, Healey said the state will cover $250 million that had come from the federal government through ARPA by tapping the Commonwealth Care Trust Fund, a state account that draws on several revenue streams. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith unravels the health coverage moves with Audrey Morse Gasteier, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Connector, and Alex Sheff, senior director of policy and government affairs at Health Care For All. Here are some of the highlights on how we got here and what the funding change means for Massachusetts residents: 
Where were we in 2025?
To start, the foundation of Massachusetts’s subsidized health care market is MassHealth, the name for the state Medicaid system – a joint state-federal program that provides health care coverage to low-income households, children, the elderly, and disabled residents. Under Gov. Mitt Romney, in 2006, so-called Romneycare was passed, building on the MassHealth structure with additional subsidies that boosted health care access for people who would not be eligible for Medicaid but are still lower income. Those subsidies, offered through the state ConnectorCare program, are run by the Health Connector and funded in part by the Commonwealth Care Trust Fund – also set up during Romney’s tenure – which brings in revenue from the cigarette tax, a state employer payroll tax, and other streams.   
When the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 under President Barack Obama, it ramped up insurance coverage and requirements, though the Bay State was already surpassing many of those standards. So before the pandemic, Massachusetts and the federal government were splitting the cost of subsidized insurance for low- and moderate-income residents.  
The American Rescue Plan Act passed during the pandemic under President Joe Biden. This “really turbocharged how much the feds were kicking in both for coverage for people in the ConnectorCare program, which was at the time for people up to about three times the federal poverty level,” Gasteier said. “It also brought tax credits to even more people, even outside of what ConnectorCare had covered. So there was a really vast number of people in the Commonwealth who were helped either through the ConnectorCare program or directly through the tax credits that came along as a result of the American Rescue Plan.” 
What did that mean for the trust fund and coverage?
With those ARPA credits in place, about $425 million new dollars were flowing into the state each year, Gasteier said. That offset about $250 million a year in state spending, and the rest went directly to people who were newly helped by the expanded tax credits.  
This meant that the newly flush trust fund was able to expand coverage, through a pilot program, by increasing its income ceiling. 
According to Sheff, about one in five people in this expanded population reported getting preventive care that they had put off for affordability reasons. About one in 10 picked up a prescription they felt like they couldn’t afford to take before. “And on top of all of that, it lowered everybody’s premiums really significantly on a monthly basis,” he said. “So kind of a win-win from our perspective. And so then the question becomes, you know, how sustainable is this?” 
So what happened after the tax credits expired?
The state still has a few days left of open enrollment through the Connector — it ends on January 23. And from Gasteier’s perspective, Massachusetts saw “exactly what we worried we would see this open enrollment,” both due to “congressional inaction” on renewing the subsidies and the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed last year. 
“What we are seeing is double the number of people have proactively terminated their coverage for 2026 than we saw at this time last open enrollment period,” she said. “So that’s just the first wave of people who looked at their bill for January and said, ‘I cannot do this.’”  
About 25,000 people have canceled outright, she said, but the state will need to wait a bit longer to understand what she calls “quiet cancellations.” Those will be people who got a premium bill in December for their January coverage that they will not be able to afford and just didn’t pay it, she said. They will be terminated from their coverage if they don’t settle up by the end of January. 
The group she and Sheff are most concerned about in terms of dropping coverage are those on the other side of an “eligibility cliff,” or just over 400 percent of the federal poverty level and making about $63,000 a year, without much extra money after handling housing, rent, and other expenses.  
Health Care For All takes about 20,000 calls a year on its helpline, Sheff said, and “we heard from people that said, ‘Oh my gosh, this changes my whole budget, my whole universe.’”  
But we knew the credits would expire. Did the state treat the new funding like we would always have this bigger pot going forward?
“It can feel now like it was a foregone conclusion that these enhanced premium tax credits weren’t gonna continue,” Sheff said. But, “certainly when we started the pilot, and even a few months ago, I wouldn’t have said that was an obvious outcome.” 
The outcome of the presidential race was uncertain, he noted, as was control of Congress. 
“If a different party was in control, the outcomes might look different,” he said. Over the course of the year, advocates and the state were in conversation with the state’s congressional delegation, he said, and Gasteier testified on the issue before Congress.  
Sheff said there was “a real sense” that there could be bipartisan agreement to extend the credits. “I think we held out hope for quite a long time that that could still happen,” Sheff said.  
They were hoping that in a different world, the pilot could continue without additional cost to the state, he said, but designing it as a pilot was a tacit acknowledgment that the funding could evaporate. It was a proof of concept, he noted, that expanding coverage could lead to better health access outcomes for those on one side of the eligibility cliff.  
Why wait until January to announce the somewhat restored funding?
“Of course we’ve all been pressing, pressing, pressing all through 2025, the strongest advocacy possible all the way through this open enrollment period, even hoping after the new year something would happen,” Gasteier said. “The governor’s announcement was to acknowledge that because of that expiration, the state is going to have to spend 250 million more dollars in order to keep that program operating as intended.” 
This is a step, she said, to keep the state from moving backwards from its pre-pandemic coverage commitments. It’s a “clarification and a recommitment,” she said, that the federal government stepping back does not mean Massachusetts will step back from the ConnectorCare program. 
Healey took a different tone in her description of the investment, with her office dubbing it the “strongest plan in the country to protect against President Trump’s ACA cost hikes.”  
Gasteier described Massachusetts as “by far the best positioned state in terms of the tools we have in place to best buffer people with the tools that we do have… if we’re seeing this pain in Massachusetts with the tools and protections we have, I shudder to think what is happening in 49 other states while we’re still waiting for the dust to settle and all the data to come in.” 
The funding will protect about 40,000 people who were part of the expansion, Sheff said. But it will not solve for the group just over that eligibility cliff that saw expanded coverage through the Connector pilot — more than 27,000 people, according to Gasteier. 
Sheff said the Connector and Health Care For All tried to be proactive in sounding the alarm about the looming loss of federal funding. “There’s also just an extent to which people don’t fully absorb what’s happening until it’s happening,” he said. His organization often hears from people who plan to keep their coverage, “and then the bill is due and, and they just can’t do it. I think it just is a reality that folks are focused on what’s right in front of them, particularly for this group that’s operating kind of paycheck to paycheck. So I think the state has done a good job as they can.” 
But is this just a one-year fix?
The Connector makes all budgeting and policy and program design decisions “on an annual basis,” Gasteier said. “So I don’t want to sort of hold up a crystal ball with respect to where we’ll be three, four, or five years from now, but we were so heartened by the state and the governor’s leadership and continued commitment to making sure that we’re showing up for people in the ConnectorCare program in the way that we’ve been able to over the years, even as we see the feds walk away from a very proven, impactful model of enhancing affordability for people.” 
In simple terms, this funding is what’s needed to “hold things kind of harmless or close to harmless” as possible, she said. But there is still a $175 million impact set to hit residents this year who now sit just outside of the ConnectorCare’s reach. 
So where does that leave us in the long-term?
In an uncertain place. MassHealth and the Health Connector are in conversations about “how we can plug holes where we’re able,” Gasteier said. The program is “designed for the long haul,” she said, and the state will need to figure out a “holistic” response given the array of federal cuts it is weathering “as we’re navigating this new world order.” 
The trust fund does have some room, but between the expanded pilot and money dedicated to help shore up the state’s stretched Health Safety net, the $250 million would take a hefty chunk out of the surplus.  
According to Doug Howgate, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, at the end of 2020, before the new tax credits took effect, the Commonwealth Care Trust Fund sat at roughly $65 million. In 2024, it held about $510 million, and by the end of 2025 it sat at about $350 million because of dedicated Health Safety Net funding and the expanded coverage pilot. 
For now, with some stabilized financing for the year, the Connector and Health Care For All are focusing on outreach to impacted residents. Sheff points to the complicated MassHealth redetermination process that started in 2023 as an indicator that an outreach and engagement effort can reach hundreds of thousands of residents affected by major health coverage shifts.  
“It’s cold comfort to somebody who’s seeing their premium double that we’re doing everything we can to clearly communicate with you about your premium doubling,” Gasteier said. “But that is what we’re trying to do — is let these people know we see you, we’re hearing what you’re going through, we are doing everything we possibly can to connect you with coverage you can afford, and trying to be the sword and shield for these folks.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Health-Connector.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-20 09:57:46.068458

MAURA HEALEY announced this month that the state would use $250 million from a state trust fund to assist some Massachusetts residents who have lost enhanced federal subsidies to pay for health care coverage. The Affordable Care Act tax credits were rolled out under the Biden administration during the pandemic through the American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA. They made it easier for people at more moderate income levels to access subsidized care.
But those credits expired at the end of 2025, with Republican resistance to extending them central to the government shutdown last year.  
They may yet return, as there is some bipartisan support for the tax credits in the House, but the Senate still seems cool to the idea. In the meantime, some states have moved to fill the funding gap. In Massachusetts, Healey said the state will cover $250 million that had come from the federal government through ARPA by tapping the Commonwealth Care Trust Fund, a state account that draws on several revenue streams. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith unravels the health coverage moves with Audrey Morse Gasteier, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Connector, and Alex Sheff, senior director of policy and government affairs at Health Care For All. Here are some of the highlights on how we got here and what the funding change means for Massachusetts residents: 
Where were we in 2025?
To start, the foundation of Massachusetts’s subsidized health care market is MassHealth, the name for the state Medicaid system – a joint state-federal program that provides health care coverage to low-income households, children, the elderly, and disabled residents. Under Gov. Mitt Romney, in 2006, so-called Romneycare was passed, building on the MassHealth structure with additional subsidies that boosted health care access for people who would not be eligible for Medicaid but are still lower income. Those subsidies, offered through the state ConnectorCare program, are run by the Health Connector and funded in part by the Commonwealth Care Trust Fund – also set up during Romney’s tenure – which brings in revenue from the cigarette tax, a state employer payroll tax, and other streams.   
When the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 under President Barack Obama, it ramped up insurance coverage and requirements, though the Bay State was already surpassing many of those standards. So before the pandemic, Massachusetts and the federal government were splitting the cost of subsidized insurance for low- and moderate-income residents.  
The American Rescue Plan Act passed during the pandemic under President Joe Biden. This “really turbocharged how much the feds were kicking in both for coverage for people in the ConnectorCare program, which was at the time for people up to about three times the federal poverty level,” Gasteier said. “It also brought tax credits to even more people, even outside of what ConnectorCare had covered. So there was a really vast number of people in the Commonwealth who were helped either through the ConnectorCare program or directly through the tax credits that came along as a result of the American Rescue Plan.” 
What did that mean for the trust fund and coverage?
With those ARPA credits in place, about $425 million new dollars were flowing into the state each year, Gasteier said. That offset about $250 million a year in state spending, and the rest went directly to people who were newly helped by the expanded tax credits.  
This meant that the newly flush trust fund was able to expand coverage, through a pilot program, by increasing its income ceiling. 
According to Sheff, about one in five people in this expanded population reported getting preventive care that they had put off for affordability reasons. About one in 10 picked up a prescription they felt like they couldn’t afford to take before. “And on top of all of that, it lowered everybody’s premiums really significantly on a monthly basis,” he said. “So kind of a win-win from our perspective. And so then the question becomes, you know, how sustainable is this?” 
So what happened after the tax credits expired?
The state still has a few days left of open enrollment through the Connector — it ends on January 23. And from Gasteier’s perspective, Massachusetts saw “exactly what we worried we would see this open enrollment,” both due to “congressional inaction” on renewing the subsidies and the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed last year. 
“What we are seeing is double the number of people have proactively terminated their coverage for 2026 than we saw at this time last open enrollment period,” she said. “So that’s just the first wave of people who looked at their bill for January and said, ‘I cannot do this.’”  
About 25,000 people have canceled outright, she said, but the state will need to wait a bit longer to understand what she calls “quiet cancellations.” Those will be people who got a premium bill in December for their January coverage that they will not be able to afford and just didn’t pay it, she said. They will be terminated from their coverage if they don’t settle up by the end of January. 
The group she and Sheff are most concerned about in terms of dropping coverage are those on the other side of an “eligibility cliff,” or just over 400 percent of the federal poverty level and making about $63,000 a year, without much extra money after handling housing, rent, and other expenses.  
Health Care For All takes about 20,000 calls a year on its helpline, Sheff said, and “we heard from people that said, ‘Oh my gosh, this changes my whole budget, my whole universe.’”  
But we knew the credits would expire. Did the state treat the new funding like we would always have this bigger pot going forward?
“It can feel now like it was a foregone conclusion that these enhanced premium tax credits weren’t gonna continue,” Sheff said. But, “certainly when we started the pilot, and even a few months ago, I wouldn’t have said that was an obvious outcome.” 
The outcome of the presidential race was uncertain, he noted, as was control of Congress. 
“If a different party was in control, the outcomes might look different,” he said. Over the course of the year, advocates and the state were in conversation with the state’s congressional delegation, he said, and Gasteier testified on the issue before Congress.  
Sheff said there was “a real sense” that there could be bipartisan agreement to extend the credits. “I think we held out hope for quite a long time that that could still happen,” Sheff said.  
They were hoping that in a different world, the pilot could continue without additional cost to the state, he said, but designing it as a pilot was a tacit acknowledgment that the funding could evaporate. It was a proof of concept, he noted, that expanding coverage could lead to better health access outcomes for those on one side of the eligibility cliff.  
Why wait until January to announce the somewhat restored funding?
“Of course we’ve all been pressing, pressing, pressing all through 2025, the strongest advocacy possible all the way through this open enrollment period, even hoping after the new year something would happen,” Gasteier said. “The governor’s announcement was to acknowledge that because of that expiration, the state is going to have to spend 250 million more dollars in order to keep that program operating as intended.” 
This is a step, she said, to keep the state from moving backwards from its pre-pandemic coverage commitments. It’s a “clarification and a recommitment,” she said, that the federal government stepping back does not mean Massachusetts will step back from the ConnectorCare program. 
Healey took a different tone in her description of the investment, with her office dubbing it the “strongest plan in the country to protect against President Trump’s ACA cost hikes.”  
Gasteier described Massachusetts as “by far the best positioned state in terms of the tools we have in place to best buffer people with the tools that we do have… if we’re seeing this pain in Massachusetts with the tools and protections we have, I shudder to think what is happening in 49 other states while we’re still waiting for the dust to settle and all the data to come in.” 
The funding will protect about 40,000 people who were part of the expansion, Sheff said. But it will not solve for the group just over that eligibility cliff that saw expanded coverage through the Connector pilot — more than 27,000 people, according to Gasteier.

The family will hold a celebration of Maureen’s life this summer. 

Maureen Larkin Seiple, wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, friend, teacher and world traveler, passed away peacefully, at the age of 99, on Jan. 8, 2026. She touched many lives in her near-century on this planet, and left it a better place.
Maureen was born in Northampton, Massachusetts on Aug. 13, 1926, and lived in Hartford, Connecticut until eighth grade.  During that time, she lost her older sister to scarlet fever and her mother to cancer.  In 1940, her family moved to Washington D.C. After graduating from high school on D-Day, she attended evening classes at George Washington University, earning tuition money by working in the college dean’s office during the day.
One day a war vet named Stan Seiple stopped by the office. Maureen thought him quite handsome, and took advantage of her position to look up his schedule and sign up for one of his classes. The rest, as they say, is history, and they married shortly after she graduated in 1950 — a union that lasted 60 years.
In 1964, Maureen and Stan and their three children left D.C. for the greener pastures of Essex Junction, Vermont.  As her children grew older, Maureen began searching for a career that would offer her new challenges, and soon decided on teaching.
After completing a master’s degree from St. Michael’s College, she began teaching children with learning disabilities in the Essex Junction school system. It was a career that she loved, and one in which she made a big difference in her students’ lives — and not only in the classroom. For example, she once persuaded a local merchant to provide a pair of winter shoes to a student in need. 
Her students returned her affection, and some of them stayed in touch with her for the rest of her life.  She loved to tell of the letter she received from one them years after she had him as a student.  “Dear Mrs. Seiple,” it read, “I miss you.  I hope you miss me.”
Maureen retired from teaching in her early ’60s, frustrated with the educational bureaucracy. But, still needing to be involved in her community, she began a new career working with refugees from places like Russia, Africa, Bhutan and Myanmar, helping them learn a new language and acclimate to American life. As usual, she couldn’t avoid becoming personally involved in their lives, frequently becoming a family friend. When the mother in one of her refugee families died, Maureen stayed close to her children for many years.
Whether it was her students or her refugee families, Maureen always went the extra mile. “You get involved in their lives,” she said.  “You don’t just walk in, teach, and leave.”
Maureen kept busy outside of teaching. Soon after retiring, someone contacted her to ask if she knew anyone interested in trading homes for a year with a French IBM employee and his family.  She and Stan decided they were interested — and within a few days they were off on a yearlong adventure that took them all over Europe.  They enjoyed the experience so much that, a few years later, they arranged to spend several months traveling around Australia and New Zealand after trading homes with a family from Sydney.
In her later years, Maureen enjoyed spending time with her family and a devoted circle of friends. She was proud to be a member of the book club she helped found more that 20 years ago, whose meetings she always loved attending. She also enjoyed attending the annual fundraiser for Dismas of Vermont along with the family of one of her former students.
When Stan began his long battle with Alzheimer’s, Maureen cared for him at home as long as she could, before his death in 2011, and afterward maintained ties to his sister, Faith, and her family. In 2001, she lost her adored brother Pat, but stayed in close touch with his wife, Mary Ann, their children, and their families. She also maintained close ties with her nephew David Stan Hettich and his family. Maureen was predeceased by her granddaughter Katy Currier whom she loved dearly and whose smile and spontaneous visits on her way home from school always perked up her day.
In addition to her children, Andy, Pam and Garth, and her grandchildren, Larkin, Lizzie, Julia, Stephen, Katie and Emily, Maureen was delighted to become a great-grandmother to Gus, Rosie, Kaia, Kane and Sadie, proudly displaying to visitors their latest photos.
The family will hold a celebration of Maureen’s life this summer.  We encourage anyone wishing to honor Maureen’s memory to consider making a donation to Dismas of Vermont, which helps formerly incarcerated Vermonters reintegrate with society. You can donate at their website.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from the Energy, Utilities and Telecommunications committee hearing)TOPEKA — Projected increases in electricity load growth are as high as 99% by 2035, a data point that pushed regional energy regulators to create a plan to stabilize and expand grid capacity and transmission, a legislative committee learned Thursday.
Part of that process includes building a controversial transmission line that will travel through four Kansas counties.
Justin Grady, director of utilities for the Kansas Corporation Commission, told the House Energy, Utilities and Telecommunications Committee that a proposed 133-mile, 345 kilovolt transmission line to be built by Evergy will travel through western Sedgwick, Sumner, Cowley and Chautauqua counties.
The project is part of Southwest Power Pool’s annual plan to support projected growth in electricity usage across its 14-state coverage area, Grady said. SPP is one of seven nonprofit organizations approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to oversee transmission infrastructure, ensure utility system reliability and manage the wholesale electricity market.
Grady said the original SPP transmission plan included $18.1 billion of transmission projects to handle expected grid expansion, but KCC and others in the state’s energy industry met with SPP and agreed on fewer projects in the immediate future.
“The projects that ultimately got notices to construct were the consensus, essentially, of the stakeholders, that these are the projects we cannot afford to delay,” Grady said. “These are reliability projects.”
Transmission projects are challenging to implement because people don’t like them, he said. 
“It’s not easy to site a transmission line,” Grady said. “By and large, landowners do not like it, and I understand completely. It carves a scar basically across the state of Kansas.”
Landowners on the planned transmission route showed up at two public hearings on Jan. 8 and 9 to voice concerns and objections to the transmission line.
John Timmerman said he has a contract for a wind energy project on his Sumner County land where the transmission line will cross. He told Evergy and KCC at the hearing that he stands to lose as much as $250,000 if he loses the wind contract.
“This line for the height and the position that it’s in will negate that windmill project,” he said at the public hearing.
Grady told the Energy committee the transmission project is necessary to support additional generation that will be added in upcoming years. Electricity needs in the region have been emphasized by storms in the past few years, including storm Uri in winter 2021 and storm Elliott, a 2022 winter storm, when the grid was stressed, he said.
“Last year during pretty mild weather, there were actual controlled load shed events in the southwest portion of the systems,” Grady said.  
Load shed refers to a purposeful, controlled shutoff of electricity in order to avoid a larger collapse of electric reliability, Grady said in an email after the meeting.
“When that one day of load shed comes in an 80-year period of time, which was winter storm Uri, then all we talk about for three years is, why did the lights go off?” he said. “Reliability is obviously job No. 1 for electric utilities and regulators, mixed in with affordability.”
Grady said load growth projections are almost “unbelievable,” showing growth in two years that previously would have been projected for 10 years. The SPP’s plan projected how many load shed events would occur if no changes occurred, he said, and the estimate is 114 days a year in 2034.
“The standard is one day in 10 years — that’s the legal standard FERC requires them to uphold,” Grady said.
In the most conservative SPP models, the $8 billion transmission project will pay for itself by 2034.
“At its worst, when this $8 billion of transmission is built at the highest price it will ever be, in 2034 that will cost an average residential customer $2.99 a month,” Grady said, adding that models that include economic benefits show a $5.31 benefit to Kansas customers.
Looking outside of transmission to need for new electricity generation resources, Grady said SPP’s projects show adequate capacity for 2025, with a 20.7% reserve margin. However, if new generating resources aren’t added by summer 2027, the reserve margin will fall to 11.8%, and by 2030, that margin would be -1.6%.
Grady said one of the questions that came up at public hearings about the proposed transmission line was whether the addition supports Kansas electricity needs or is only about shipping electricity outside the state.
“That line was engineered and designed to correct for the severe reliability issues that occurred during winter storm Elliott,” Grady said.
Elliott occurred just after Uri and resulted in millions of people losing electricity on Christmas Eve, he said.
“We avoided load shed in SPP, mainly because there was 20,000 megawatts of wind online,” Grady said. “We are connected electrically to the entire eastern United States. Sometimes major reliability events that are happening in North Carolina can even ultimately affect what happens in southeast Kansas. The reality is that’s the reason this transmission line was designed and built. My position is that certainly that line will benefit Kansans.”
KCC is holding a third public hearing on the proposed transmission line at 6 p.m. Tuesday, at the Hutchinson Community College Stringer Fine Arts Center. The meeting can be attended by Zoom or in-person, but residents wanting to make public comments should register by noon Monday.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Justin-Grady-legislature-1024x656.png,,,2026-01-20 09:57:46.068458

(Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)Alaska schools, students and education funding will continue to be in focus in the 2026 legislative session set to begin on Jan. 20, but early signs show they are unlikely to be at the center of the political spotlight as they were last year. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy will not be pursuing education policy changes this year, according to a spokesperson with his office on Friday. Instead, he will focus on a state fiscal plan and the proposed development of the Alaska LNG gas pipeline, his office said. 
Those policy changes were at the heart of Dunleavy’s objection to increased education funding last year, and he said they were essential to boosting student achievement. He called a special session in August for lawmakers to address his policy items, but legislators took no action other than overriding two of his vetoes. 
One of those veto overrides was an historic win for education advocates: it restored a $700 increase to per student funding, known as the base student allocation, adding $50.6 million in education funding to the state’s budget.  
Yet many Alaska school districts continue to face steep budget deficits, and struggle to address the rising cost of operations, school maintenance, teacher retention and lost of federal funding. The Anchorage School District — the state’s largest district — is grappling with an $80 million shortfall, however the district and the union representing teachers reached a tentative agreement over the weekend on a new three-year contract. There may also be changes on the federal level because the Trump administration has promised to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education.
Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage, and chair of the Senate Education Committee, said it is still unclear whether lawmakers will again take action this year to increase education funding through the base student allocation. Tobin also co-chairs the special task force on education funding created this year. 
“It is difficult to know what the body is willing to do at this point in time,” Tobin said, as lawmakers are in transit back to Juneau this week, and caucuses are meeting to discuss policy priorities. 
But Tobin said she anticipates some kind of funding increase to help districts keep up with inflation. “Inflation continues to be a pressing issue in the state, and we don’t want the gains we made by increasing the basic allocation by $700 this last budget cycle to diminish because of inflation,” she said.
Rep. Andi Story, D-Juneau is co-chair of the House Education Committee and agreed an inflation adjustment is a major priority. “We don’t want to lose any ground,” she said in an interview Friday, pointing out the increase to the BSA only added $20 per student more than the year before.  
Dunleavy told reporters in December he hoped the legislature would pass a bill to launch a pilot program for schools run by Alaska Native tribes, known as tribal compacting, introduced last year. Tobin said the initiative is a priority, and said she supports tribal compacting statewide and wants to see greater tribal consultation and engagement throughout all districts. 
She said increasing funding for school maintenance will also be a major priority, as many rural districts grapple with deteriorating facilities and an estimated $800 million in deferred maintenance. 
Tobin said members of the task force recently made a visit to a school in Fairbanks with one of three boilers working — in subzero temperatures — and a plan to evacuate students if the last one failed. “That’s 726 students that will be displaced. It will be a huge hit to the Fairbanks education community,” she said. “It has the potential to really harm our students’ learning and what we need to do in Juneau, during this 34th legislature, to set us up for a long term solution on rebuilding our schools, is very much at the forefront of my mind.”
Tobin co-chairs the task force on education funding, which was established this spring to conduct an 18-month study and create policy recommendations for how the state funds schools. Members have expressed interest in a wide variety of policy initiatives: from revisiting the school funding formula, to investigating chronic absenteeism, to student performance and accountability measures, and policy changes sought by the governor like open enrollment and reading incentive programs. They are slated to deliver their recommendations at the start of the next legislative session in 2027. 
Tobin said task force members have made visits to schools in Fairbanks, the Matanuska-Susitna, Anchorage and Kenai Peninsula boroughs, and have plans to visit Skagway, Juneau, Bethel and Western Alaska. 
Republican leaders of the Senate and House minority caucuses did not respond to interview requests on their priorities for education. 
Veto override for additional education funding still in question
Lawmakers could also take up another veto override vote within the first five days of the session. Last year, lawmakers passed a corporate tax bill tied to online sales in Alaska that could generate up to $65 million in revenue that would go to fund career and technical education and K-12 reading improvement programs. Dunleavy vetoed it in September. 
Whether lawmakers will take up the override vote next week is unclear. At least 40 of 60 legislators are needed to override the governor’s veto within the first five days of the legislative session. 
In August, lawmakers narrowly overrode the governor’s budget veto of last year’s education funding increase by a vote of 45 to 14.
Tobin and Story, as education committee chairs, said the override vote and restoring additional education dollars is essential, especially for reading, and funding programs instituted by the Alaska Reads Act.  
House Speaker Rep. Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, said via text that the Majority caucus is meeting to discuss legislative priorities this weekend. “Protecting education and public safety items in the budget along with other core services will be a priority in an environment that will be fiscally constrained,” he said. 
Edgmon did not confirm whether an override vote would take place, as of Thursday.

The Norwich Personnel and Pension Board is scheduled to consider a request Tuesday from the longtime mayor to participate in a pension plan for city employees and elected officials.
Nystrom finished his last term as mayor in early December 2025. Records reviewed by Connecticut Public show two weeks before stepping down, Nystrom contacted the city’s pension board and asked to buy back eight years of service credit, encompassing the last two of his three terms in office.
If the request is granted, Nystrom would be eligible to immediately begin receiving pension benefits after making a one-time payment into the municipal retirement system, which is funded by contributions from employees and the city.
Nystrom, a 68-year-old former Republican lawmaker, also receives a state pension. He previously represented the community in the Connecticut General Assembly, serving 18 years as a state representative.
Nystrom began receiving monthly pension payments from the state in 2014 after officially retiring from state service, according to records provided by the State Employees Retirement System.
State law doesn’t prevent Nystrom from receiving a second public pension, though it’s unclear whether he is eligible to join the city’s plan.
During a preliminary discussion in November, members of the Norwich pension board expressed confusion about how to handle his request. They questioned whether Nystrom declined offers to participate in the retirement system when he took office in 2017, or at the start of his final term in 2021.
Joining now after twice saying no “would go against everything that I have ever heard” about pension rules, one board member said, according to a recording reviewed by Connecticut Public.
“If that didn’t happen, then that’s a different story,” said the board member, whose identity was unclear from the recording.
“The issue for me is he’ll be old enough to collect immediately,” board member Patrick McMahon said. “So it’s eight years of investment that doesn’t exist. Now, it’s over a $400 million plan, so it’s peanuts. But … if you can’t invest it, you can’t get a return.”
The board voted to table the discussion until Jan. 20. They asked city staff to determine how much Nystrom must contribute to join the retirement system, and whether he received previous opportunities to participate.
Norwich mayor’s role
Nystrom received an annual salary of $45,000 during his time in office, a figure set by the city charter.
Norwich operates under a council/manager form of government. The six members of the council and the mayor are elected at large, and the council appoints a city manager, who serves as the community’s chief administrator.
The mayor nevertheless carries out important functions for the city, including coordinating economic development.
Mayors are eligible for retirement benefits under the charter, which establishes that “The Mayor shall be entitled to the same benefits package as is available to the elected registrars and the City Treasurer.”
However, elected officials aren’t automatically enrolled. The city’s pension rules stipulate those who are eligible can participate “by notifying the board in writing, within 90 days of the date of their election or appointment.”
The chairperson of the Personnel and Pension Board declined to discuss Nystrom’s request in advance of the board’s January meeting. Administrative staff from the city also declined to answer questions about Nystrom’s eligibility.
Nystrom did not respond to emails and a letter seeking comment. He could not be reached by phone.
Decades of public service
A Norwich native, Nystrom has a long record of public service in the community. He first won office to the city council in 1979 at age 22, and served in the House from 1984 to 2002, when he lost a bid for state senate.
Nystrom returned to municipal politics, and served his first term as mayor from 2009 to 2013. After losing to Democrat Deberey Hinchey, he returned to the mayor’s office four years later and won reelection in 2021.
He was barred from competing in the 2025 race by the city charter, which allows a maximum of two consecutive four-year terms. Nystrom now serves on the city council.
Outside of public life, Nystrom worked for more than two decades for the United Parcel Service.
His decision to balance full-time employment with his part-time duties as mayor drew criticism from at least one of his political opponents. During the 2013 race, Hinchey vowed to devote her full attention to serving as mayor, contrasting herself with Nystrom’s dual employment.
But The Day of New London endorsed Nystrom, writing that he proved he was “working full-time for Norwich citizens, or close to it” by attending numerous meetings and functions.
Buyback would be costly
Under one calculation described in the city’s retirement plan documents, Nystrom would stand to earn an annual pension in the range of $7,000 to $8,000, depending on whether his participation start date is determined to be before or after Jan. 1, 2018.
The calculation sets pension payments at between 1.95% and 2.2% of the average of an employee’s three highest earning years, multiplied by years of service.
However, city officials have not described how they would interpret the pension rules.
It’s also unclear whether Nystrom’s request to buy back service credit is permissible. A plan document describes limited scenarios in which buybacks are allowed, including for military service, time spent on worker’s compensation, and probationary periods, when new employees aren’t yet contributing to retirement.
Buying back service credit would require Nystrom to make a significant lump-sum payment, meant to account for eight years of missed contributions, plus compounding interest. During the November meeting, members of the pension board speculated the amount would be in the tens of thousands of dollars, based on multiplying his $45,000 annual salary by an 8% contribution rate, and eight years of service.
Records obtained via a state Freedom of Information Act request show Nystrom receives a separate monthly pension benefit totaling $1,860.29 from the state retirement system.
His state pension stems largely from his service as a legislator. Documents show he earned an average salary of $34,849 during his final three years in the House. Nystrom also worked part-time for Eastern Connecticut State University from 1979 through 1984 during the spring and fall semesters, according to his pension paperwork.
Records show Nystrom additionally credited his first term in office as mayor of Norwich toward his total years of state service, paying $3,816 to buy back service credit for the years 2009 through 2013.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NORWICH-0501-SR-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 11:57:57.821183

More than a year after the Eaton Fire ripped through Los Angeles County’s Altadena neighborhood, small businesses in the area still face various hurdles as they struggle to recover from a disaster that killed at least 19 people.
As CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay explains, the wildfire destroyed more than 9,000 structures, wiping out about half of Altadena’s businesses. Many small business owners Levi spoke with brought up similar challenges as they try to get back on their feet, such as frustrating delays from insurance companies and limited assistance from federal and state governments.
Some help available to homeowners, for example, is not extended to small business owners. Matt Schodorf, a co-owner of an Altadena coffee shop that burned down, said the Federal Emergency Management Agency initially excluded the store for debris removal. It was only after he took his story to the media and received support from an L.A. County supervisor, Schodorf said, that FEMA included the shop in its debris cleanup.

Schodorf: “It feels frustrating because it feels we are very small potatoes, especially from the perspective of the government. It doesn’t seem like it would be too much to ask: Waive permit fees, clean our lots out. Don’t make us go on national news pleading for help.”

State law also allows homeowners to get some upfront payouts from insurance companies without having to provide a full itemized inventory — a policy that isn’t extended to businesses and could lengthen the claims process.
For some business owners, the obstacles and the fallout from the fire, prove to be too much.

Carrie Meyers, owner of a former Altadena pet store that burned down and won’t be reopened: “People want me back. But I don’t know if we can survive up there. No one lives there … mentally I’m not there.”

$23 billion for CA research?

From CalMatters higher education reporter Mikhail Zinshteyn:
A bipartisan coalition of state lawmakers is backing a bill to place a bond measure before voters in 2026 on whether to approve $23 billion in science research funding.Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, is leading the effort. He presents Senate Bill 895 as a California contingency plan to fund research into vaccines, wildfire prevention and other disciplines at a time when the Trump administration is either attempting to slash already approved research or install rules that halt funding for research that federal agencies used to support before President Donald Trump took office last year. 
When asked if the measure is necessary once Trump is out of office, Wiener said U.S. political instability may mean more federal science cuts even after Trump. 

Wiener, to CalMatters during a press call Friday: “It’s important for California just to be like a rock in the storm, so that we’re just doing science here and investing in science … regardless of what’s happening with the federal government at that moment in time.”

Any drugs created with this state money would be discounted for Californians, according to the legislation. The funding would flow to California’s public universities and other research entities. The union of graduate student workers is also backing the bond.



New rules for CA homelessness funds

Gov. Gavin Newsom is turning up the pressure on California cities and counties to do more to curb homeless encampments by adding new strings to homelessness funds, write Marisa Kendall and Ben Christopher.
In Mendocino County, for example, the state appears to be holding funds hostage — which were already approved in the 2024-25 budget and have recently become available — until the county can explain its plans to pass an encampment ordinance to the state, according to the senior program manager with the county’s Department of Social Services. But the new rule puts the social services department in a bind, since it doesn’t have the authority to weigh in on enforcement. 
Newsom, the Legislature, local officials and other stakeholders are also likely to continue hashing out the conditions for the $500 million in homelessness funding proposed in this year’s budget, which must be passed by late June.
This call for local governments to step up isn’t sitting well with some advocates. 

Carolyn Coleman, executive director and CEO of the League of California Cities: “I worry that, one, we may leave more cities out. And, two, that we may cause delays in the ability to get more people housed sooner, which I think is the goal.”

Its methane gas leak in 2015-16 displaced 10,000 families and caused illness.","Guest Commentary written by

Madison Kerbeck
Madison Kerbeck is a graduate student at Columbia University


This is the 10-year anniversary of the largest methane gas leak in United States history. Over  four months in 2015 and 2016, the Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility in Los Angeles County — the largest gas storage site in California — released more than 100,000 tons of methane, drowning nearby communities in toxic fumes. 
The leak caused pounding headaches, uncontrollable nausea and bloody noses, and displaced  10,000 families. Some health effects were more detrimental, including memory loss, slurred speech and impaired vision. UCLA researchers also found the gas leak led to full-term newborns being born underweight, some weighing 5 and a half pounds or less. 
I was 14, living four miles from the facility. I can still remember the smell. Two of my good friends suffered horrible headaches and were displaced. They lived in a house provided to them for a couple of months.
After the incident, the facility shut down in 2016 only to be reopened in 2017. Was reopening the facility safe, or couldn’t Southern California Gas Co. bear the financial loss any longer? 
After the gas leak, revenue for SoCalGas’ parent company, Sempra Energy, dropped by 8.9%, to $2.16 billion. The most state Senator Henry Stern was able to secure from SoCalGas was a $71 million settlement, which represents just 5% of Sempra’s 2016 profit. 
The settlement will benefit the 1.8 million residents of neighboring communities where traces of methane were found. It is being invested in green infrastructure for homes and schools, with the goal of reducing natural gas use. 
So why, then, do we need to keep this site open? 
While working as Stern’s legislative intern in 2024 and attending a press conference in front of the SoCalGas headquarters that December, I saw firsthand that residents in the affected communities do not consider this a win. Members of the public want the facility to remain closed.

Residents still received power the year Aliso was shut down, proving the facility is not essential to the community and, more importantly, not worth the risk. 
State officials claimed the facility can only be shut down once natural gas demand decreases, but California has already proven how quickly we can move away from fossil fuels. 
The 2018 California Clean Energy Act proposed to increase zero-carbon energy sources by 60% over 12 years. The goals were met in just three years. With the right municipal mandates, the San Fernando Valley can reduce gas usage while meeting its energy demands. By increasing renewable energy and setting reduction requirements, we will not have to depend on Aliso Canyon. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom promised during his first term to close the facility. A coalition of scientists, including PhDs from top universities, wrote a joint letter supporting the closure.
However, in December 2024, Newsom ignored this advice and broke the trust the community placed in him. He supported state officials’ decision to not only keep the facility open but to expand it.
The need for a shutdown is dire because the storage facility sits directly above the Santa Susana fault line.
The facility failed during the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which had a magnitude of 6.7. Currently, the surrounding area of Aliso Canyon has a 78% chance of experiencing a major earthquake over the next 50 years. Reopening and expanding a massive gas facility above a fault line is not just irresponsible, it’s reckless. 
The public has protested. Lawmakers have pleaded. Scientists have spoken. And yet, 10 years later, Aliso Canyon still stands. 
How long do we wait? Until the next blowout? Until another earthquake? We cannot afford to wait any longer — not when lives are at stake. 
It’s time to shut it down.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/110521-Aliso-Canyon-Gas-Plant-AP-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-20 08:57:01.151972

Michelle Lujan Grisham signed an executive order that bans CYFD from housing youth in its offices. The ban goes into effect March, 2026. ((Dean Hanson/Albuquerque Journal)Starting March 1, the New Mexico Children, Youth & Families Department can no longer house youth in its custody in government office buildings while awaiting foster placement, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office announced on Monday.
The ban comes via an executive order and follows years of concerns and incidents regarding the practice.
“Children who have experienced trauma deserve safety, stability and dignity — not sleeping in offices,” the governor said in a statement. “This executive order makes clear that New Mexico will not accept anything less than appropriate care for children in our custody.”
According to a news release, as of Friday CYFD had stopped new office, is in the process of “relocating remaining youth into appropriate placements.” The practice of using office space began, the news release said, “when agencies couldn’t place sibling groups together, when treatment facilities discharged them without available placements, or when older youth refused other options.”
“This executive order reflects the standard our children deserve and the responsibility we carry as a department,” CYFD Acting Secretary Valerie Sandoval said in a statement. “We have taken decisive steps to stop office stays, and we will continue working with providers, caregivers, and partners across state government to ensure every child in our care has a safe and appropriate place to stay.”
The order comes as the state begins to stand up a new Office of Advocacy at CYFD, established during the 2025 legislative session via House Bill 5. It also comes ahead of an expected push for additional reforms in the legislative session starting Tuesday.
One of those reforms comes from State Rep. Rebecca Dow (R-Truth or Consequences): a pilot program to address the lack of adequate and appropriate foster placements.
In a news release Monday, Dow noted that “an executive order alone doesn’t create placements for kids who have nowhere else to go.” Her bill, she said, “is about putting children first by stabilizing placements, supporting foster families, and using proven, evidence-based care to make sure no child is ever forced to sleep in a government office again.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CYFD-1024x522.jpeg,,,2026-01-20 08:57:01.151972

Forward Party of Utah Sen. Emily Buss of Eagle Mountain is kicking off her public office career in the Utah Senate this year. She was chosen in an open, nonpartisan selection vote in her district to replace former longtime West Valley City Sen. Daniel Thatcher, who switched parties and then stepped down last year, opening up a spot for a new third-party lawmaker.
Rep. John Arthur, a Holladay Democrat, is replacing former Rep. Gay Lynn Bennion after she switched her state capitol seat for Cottonwood Heights’ Mayor’s Office. 
After former House Majority Leader Rep. Jefferson Moss was tapped to lead the Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity, District 51 Republicans elected Rep. Leah Hansen of Saratoga Springs last summer.

All will serve until the end of the year, unless they are reelected in November.
Buss, Arthur and Hansen spoke to Utah News Dispatch about their legislative ambitions as they prepared for the 45-day general session. 
A lawmaker with no caucus
When Emily Buss starts her first legislative session as state senator, she won’t have a caucus to convene with. She, like her predecessor, will be the only Forward party voice in the Capitol, and she’s already feeling the pressure, she said. 
“I kind of feel like I’m a political experiment for everybody involved,” Buss said.
The Forward Party of Utah came together when the state’s two centrist groups merged last year. It is an affiliate of the national Forward Party.
While many at the Capitol are helping her to get up to speed, Buss expects to be out of the loop on some issues.
“I hope that I can be an example of what politics can look like, and we’re just trying to solve the bipartisan issues,” she said, “and what you can achieve when your hands aren’t tied by party leadership.”
Buss, the 35-year-old founder of the Birthday Box Foundation, is now one of the youngest lawmakers this session. She hopes “to bring the resourceful millennial working-class mindset,” she said.
This year she’s working on a bill that would create a database for bill summaries described in plain language and with details on the financial impact they may have on county, city and personal taxes. 
She’s also trying to find solutions for areas experiencing rapid growth, like the one where she lives. A goal for Buss, for example, is to find a way to create a grant for high-growth school districts.
“The area I’m from is exploding at the seams, and rather than putting all of that property tax burden onto the taxpayers, (the idea is) creating a fund that high-growth districts can qualify for to help secure land and capital improvements, like starting to build schools before they’re already bursting at the seams,” she said.
Buss’ district also encompasses other areas, like much of Tooele, and parts of West Valley City, Magna, Kearns and other municipalities west of Interstate 15. She plans on meeting with all of the mayors, city council members and city managers in the district to learn about their top concerns, she said. However, she has already defined a big priority for the area.
“I’m going to be a huge advocate on transportation and just infrastructure and connectivity in general for the west side and all of the communities that are growing,” Buss said.
While she may be considered “a wild card in the political sphere,” she said, don’t expect major drama from her time in the Legislature. 
“No one knows what to expect from me, and I hope they’ll be pleasantly surprised that I’m just a nice, easy-to-get-along-with person who doesn’t care about the drama,” Buss said. “I’m just here to help the most people while I can make the biggest impact while I’m here. I don’t have ambitions of being a politician for my whole life.”
A Utah ‘teacher of the year’
The week before the start of the session, John Arthur was still “cranking out sub plans,” he said on Wednesday. Finding a long-term substitute for the full 45 days the Legislature is in session was a big concern for him as a teacher at a Title I school elementary school in Salt Lake City.
However, his job was also what inspired his political career, he said. Seeing how public education governance impacted his work, especially after receiving the 2021 Utah Teacher of the Year recognition, made him want to push for different standards and considerations as policy is being written. 
While Arthur’s young years were spent on different army bases following his father, a U.S. Army airborne ranger, he grew up in Cottonwood Heights, where his family settled. 
“Now, all these years later, I moved my wife and two little girls to nearby, in Holladay, but basically the same area and same community,” he said. “And now I am the representative in the statehouse for the same middle school and high school and friends and neighbors I grew up with.”
Arthur has filed his first bill, which aims to “deliver on the promises that we’ve made to educators,” he said, by ensuring teachers keep the raises they received when the Utah Fits All Scholarship passed, regardless of the program’s fate after a district court ruled it to be unconstitutional.
“If that program fails, then that raise for educators will also go away, and every teacher in the state of Utah will lose that money,” Arthur said. “And so my bill is an attempt to make sure that that is not a threat that we have to worry about.”
 Another issue he’s hoping to pursue is the “amount of polarization and conflict” experienced in the Utah State Board of Education, an issue that has been ramping up since a 2016 law made the institution a partisan office.
“State school board races forever were nonpartisan, until that law passed,” he said. “And now we’re in a situation where our state school board is often in the news for not great things, because we are electing partisan school board members where we should really be focusing on (their) expertise and excellence in education.”
While that’s a big part of his platform, Arthur is also planning to push on natural resources and climate policy, he said. 
Still, he acknowledges that entering the Legislature as a Democratic freshman may be rocky.
“I am not naive. I know that I am the newest kid in the minority caucus,” he said. “But I also believe my whole life that if you come to people with dignity and care, and you humanize them, and you let them know that you’re not coming with ulterior motives, you are coming to do good work that most people will meet you in that work.”
‘An ordinary citizen’
Leah Hansen has gradually learned all the ins and outs of citizen participation in the legislative process since she started attending committee and floor meetings 10 years ago.
“I learned all these things through trial and error, and it’s just become something that I don’t want to say I enjoy doing, but something that I feel I’ve needed to do,” Hansen said, “and I see so few of the ordinary citizens up there.”
Hansen said she’s first and foremost a wife and a mother. With her children grown she has been volunteering to manage a Saratoga Springs community social media account, and now, she’s preparing for a more active role, representing them in the Legislature. 
However, the new Republican lawmaker isn’t aiming to file tons of legislative proposals.
As state leaders complain that lawmakers continue breaking the record number of bills introduced during the general session, Hansen’s approach is to start light this year.
“I don’t have any bills at this time because I believe that restraint begins with me. If I’m wanting to limit government, I’d better start by limiting myself,” she said. “But more so because there were so many bills that there were just so many to stay on top of, that I didn’t want to put any more burden on us than we need to be having at the moment.”
She’s looking at some issues, she said. But she hasn’t agreed to running any bills yet.
“I want to make sure that they are actually necessary and proper for the government to be doing,” she said. 
Hansen was born in Hawaii to students from Tonga and New Zealand attending Brigham Young University-Hawaii. She lived in Tonga until she turned 12 years old, when her family moved to Utah and hasn’t left since.
Now, as a legislator, she says she wants to keep a connection to her Saratoga Springs community and have individual, “ordinary citizens,” like her, join lawmakers at the Capitol to see for themselves how laws take shape.
But also, she’s aiming to advocate for freedom and the proper role of government, she said. 
Hansen hopes for better things for the country and the state, and she believes a lot of that can happen when leaders evaluate which direction the state is taking.
“Are we heading toward freedom, or is it something else that’s unrecognizable?” she said. “There are so many laws. I personally think that there are a lot of unnecessary laws that don’t need to be there.”
When asked about her thoughts on the role of government, she said, it should “stay in its lane, allow the people to live their lives.”
“I think government needs to mind their own business and just do the things that they’re supposed to do, which is to protect and secure the rights of the people, period,” she said.

But nothing has so defined and marked Nevada – physical, culturally and eternally – like the development and testing of nuclear weapons […]","Operation Buster-Jangle - Dog test — with troops participating in exercise Desert Rock I. It was the first U.S. nuclear field exercise conducted on land; troops shown are a mere 6 miles from the blast at the Nevada test site in 1951. (Public domain)There are many things that have defined Nevada over time: the Kit Carson trail, the legalization of gaming and loosening of divorce laws, the construction of the Hoover Dam to name a few. But nothing has so defined and marked Nevada – physical, culturally and eternally – like the development and testing of nuclear weapons here. 
Nevada’s deserts played a pivotal role in America’s rise as a nuclear superpower. The Nevada Test Site (now the Nevada National Security Site) hosted over 900 nuclear weapons tests between the 1950s and 1990s. But relentless Cold War testing came at a tremendous cost. Many Nevadans and other Americans in “downwinder” communities were exposed to radioactive fallout and later developed serious illnesses like cancer. 
These diagnoses continue to this day; a reminder for us all that the price of our security is still being paid.
In 1990, Congress created the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) to provide financial compensation to individuals harmed by radiation exposure from U.S. nuclear tests and uranium mining. Since then, the program has helped over 39,000 Americans suffering from radiation-linked cancers and illnesses to find treatment and care, saving many lives.
RECA was set to expire in June 2024, just as many Cold War veterans are entering their golden years and facing compounding illnesses. But our Senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen recognized this immorality and fought to extend RECA, introducing standalone legislation and lobbying their Republican colleagues on its importance, including working with Nevada’s only Republican in Congress, Rep. Mark Amodei. Because of this bipartisan work, the Republican-controlled Senate extended RECA this year and raised the maximum payout to $100,000 per claim.
Unfortunately, the extension of RECA only partially solved this problem because even RECA’s revival leaves some Nevadans behind. 
When Congress passed RECA, the law specifically excluded servicemen and women who worked on classified projects and settings at Nevada’s sites, even though many suffered the same deadly illnesses and cancers as civilian downwinders. 
That’s why Nevada Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen introduced the “Fighting for the Overlooked Recognition of Groups Operating in Toxic Test Environments in Nevada Act,” or the FORGOTTEN Veterans Act, which would ensure no veteran of the Cold War is excluded from coverage and left behind.
The bill would officially classify the Nevada Test and Training Range as a “contaminated” location and require DoD to document all toxic exposures in each service member’s confidential records. When those individuals seek medical care at the VA, there will be proof in their file of where they served and what hazards they faced, without revealing any sensitive mission details publicly. The proposal will verify all service at the sites since 1951, and provide medical coverage for radiation-related illnesses, fully closing the loophole for Nevada’s veterans.
As Sen. Cortez Masto herself said when introducing the FORGOTTEN Veterans Act, “as a nation, it is our obligation to take care of all veterans once their service has ended.” 
The Forgotten Veterans Act was very nearly enacted into law in December 2025. With the leadership of Senator Rosen and Senator Cortez Masto, the bill garnered bipartisan support and was added to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for final passage. Unfortunately, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson deleted the proposal from the NDAA before the final vote despite widespread support in both parties and in both chambers of Congress. This incredibly immoral act by Speaker Johnson requires us to double down with public advocacy on the need to pass this legislation.
Nevada has learned the hard way that the fallout of nuclear testing isn’t just a cloud in the sky, it’s a generations-long burden on real people. And our nation shouldn’t turn a blind eye to the burden that civilians and veterans are still shouldering. 
Thanks to the advocacy of Sens Cortez Masto and Rosen, Nevadans are finally having their voice heard on an issue so long ignored. But, while we are on the verge of securing the medical treatments and financial support that has long been denied for decades, the forces that have tried to sweep this under the rug are still at work. It’s on all of us to keep this in the light and keep up the fight until we deliver on the promise the nation made to these Nevadans.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Exercise_Desert_Rock_I_Buster-Jangle_Dog_002.jpg,,,2026-01-20 08:57:01.151972

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)The chair of the Alabama Senate committee overseeing the state’s General Fund has filed two bills aimed at pressuring several cities to drop a lawsuit challenging the state’s Internet sales tax, known as the Simplified Sellers Use Tax (SSUT).
SB 36, sponsored by Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, would allow people living outside a city to petition the municipality for refunds for sales and use taxes paid on purchases they made in the city.
A second bill, SB 37, prevents local municipalities from collecting sales and use taxes from people who travel to their area to purchase items.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“This makes the tax system more fair for rural Alabama,” Albritton said in an interview on Tuesday. “It allows the destination monies, the taxes that are paid on transactions, to be carried forward to the destination.”
A third Albritton bill, SB 150, reallocates a $10 fee that municipal courts collect to pay for operations to the state General Fund.
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit criticized Albritton’s proposals last week.
“Senator Albritton’s two bills would defund police departments, bankrupt school systems and freeze economic development in every municipality in Alabama,” a spokesperson for the city of Tuscaloosa said in a statement on Wednesday. “Senator Albritton publicly threatened retribution and appears to be delivering with this proposed legislation. For nearly a decade, multiple cities have engaged the Alabama Department of Revenue and the Legislature to fix the legal issues with Simplified Sellers Use Tax.”
The SSUT has been a stabilizing revenue stream for the General Fund, which for years struggled with rising program costs and flat revenue growth. The Education Trust Fund, a separate budget that pays for public education, gets nearly all of the state’s income and sales tax revenues, and most General Fund revenues prior to the SSUT tended to show flat annual growth.
‘I am going to take their money’
The lawsuit, filed against the Alabama Department of Revenue in August, seeks to remove several companies from the SSUT program, which allocates a greater amount directly to local municipalities and their respective school districts than the traditional sales tax.
The lawsuit alleges that the Simplified Sellers Use Tax is unconstitutional and that the Alabama Department of Revenue, the state agency responsible for administering it, is allowing companies to take part in the program that allows them to collect a reduced sales tax rate of 8%, compared to some municipalities with that levy a higher percentage through a traditional sales tax.
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit include the cities of Tuscaloosa, Mountain Brook and Montgomery and the Alabama Education Association, which represents K-12 teachers in the state.
Albritton has been an outspoken critic of the lawsuit, which he sees as a threat to a critical revenue source for the General Fund. The senator, a member of the Contract Review Committee, twice delayed state agency contracts in protest of the lawsuit. He said that taxes are within the purview of the Alabama Legislature and not within the jurisdiction of the judicial branch of government.
“They are trying to steal my money, so I am going to take their money,” Albritton said on Tuesday.
The plaintiffs want a state court to disqualify several larger retailers with a significant presence in the state because SSUT was originally meant to apply sales taxes to transactions from Alabama residents who make purchases online from retailers that are not based in the state, which would not be possible using the Internet.
The city of Tuscaloosa alleges in the lawsuit that SSUT is creating a shortfall in revenues of about $14.6 million.
Alabama is allocated a portion of the sales taxes collected from brick-and-mortar stores, but the money is directed toward the Educational Trust Fund budget. That is not the case with taxes gained from online sales, which is given to the General Fund budget. Disqualifying retailers from SSUT would redirect the sales tax revenues from the General Fund budget to the ETF.
The Association of County Commissions of Alabama (ACCA) opposes the lawsuit and has said it could cut critical revenue for counties, which have little to no power to levy their own taxes.
“The position that they are taking on SSUT is not consistent with the position they take on sales tax,” said Sonny Brasfield, executive director of the ACCA, in an interview on Friday. “In SSUT, their position is if products are sold and wind up in the city limits of Tuscaloosa, then Tuscaloosa should get all the money.”
That is different from sales tax.
“When people drive to Tuscaloosa to shop and make purchases and drive back home to use those products, if we are being consistent in our arguments, then we should let that tax money follow the product back where the product is used,” Brasfield said. “That is the core of their argument in the lawsuit.”
Greg Cochran, the executive director of the Alabama League of Municipalities, an organization that represents cities, said in an interview Wednesday that the group plans to meet with Albritton “and talk to him about the complexity of trying to exempt nonresidents from paying those local taxes, sales taxes and lodging taxes that come into a municipality, and the chaos that it could create when you have places like Jefferson County and Shelby County that have over 60 municipalities.”
“It would create shopping venues for residents from outside of your district getting incentivized to go next door and shop,” he said.
Graham Smith, the mayor of Mountain Brook, a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said in a statement that plaintiffs were looking for “a modern, thoughtful solution” to the issue.“Over 20 states have already implemented a more robust and fair way of approaching SSUT,” the statement said.  “We welcome any and all discussion with our State Representatives.”
Richard Rush, who leads the government relations, external affairs, and crisis communications efforts for the city of Tuscaloosa said that the arguments in the lawsuit are valid.
“The claim that his proposed legislation is in any way comparable to our solutions is preposterous,” Rush said in a statement on Wednesday. “Frankly, it is apples to oranges. Beyond the impossible implementation of his proposed legislation, taking Senator Albritton at face value, when he travels I-65 like hundreds of thousands of others to Montgomery and stops at Bates House of Turkey, he would not pay any sales taxes to the City of Greenville. Greenville’s schools, police, fire and essential services would suffer.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Albritton-April-3-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-20 08:57:01.151972

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)As U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement steps up the use of digital surveillance to track immigrants and citizens alike, Minnesotans can use a new, little-known law to push back.
The Minnesota Consumer Data Privacy Act — signed into law in 2024 — gives Minnesota residents the right to tell companies “no” when it comes to selling their data or using it for profiling and targeted advertising. The problem is that even with the help of the legislation, the data market has become too vast and opaque for the average person to rein in their information.
Still, this power became newly relevant when ICE bought access in September to a social media and phone surveillance system that allows them to monitor city blocks and neighborhoods — and track the movements of people’s smart phones, watches and other devices, 404 Media reported last week.
ICE obtained the technology from the Nebraska-based contractor Penlink, which uses commercial and publicly available location data acquired from hundreds of millions of phones. ICE can access the data without a warrant, 404 Media reported.
ICE didn’t respond to the Reformer’s request for comment about whether it was using surveillance systems to track people in Minnesota in its latest immigration surge.
Minnesota has been the focus of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts since December, with tensions escalating last week when ICE agent Johnathan Ross fatally shot Renee Good in her car in south Minneapolis.
John Boehler, a policy counsel with ACLU Minnesota, said that the organization is aware of ICE using facial recognition software and license plate readers in Minnesota. Federal agents have reportedly for years been using surveillance mechanisms to track people.
To use the new Minnesota data privacy law, people need to reach out to companies, such as data brokers, to request that their information be deleted and not sold to a third party. This is difficult for people who are unfamiliar with the expansive and elusive web of data brokerages that gather and profit off of millions of peoples’ data every day — including those with ICE contracts.
People often do not know when their data is being collected, used and sold for profit; the Minnesota law was designed to give people more agency in how their information is used.
The Minnesota law is unlikely to completely delete a person’s personal data from all sources, but it provides an avenue to ensure at least one company doesn’t use their information.
The law defines personal data as any information that is linked to an identifiable person. It does not cover publicly available information.
Data brokers and surveillance companies often gather cell phone location data from software development kits, which are bundles of code used by developers to make applications, like weather apps. The software development kit owners then pay app developers for user location data.
Real-time bidding is also a source of location data, according to 404 Media. Companies in online advertising place bids to get their advertisements in front of certain demographics. But many popular apps, like Candy Crush and prayer and dating apps, are likely being co-opted to harvest location data, Wired reported.
In short, there are many ways data brokers and companies can acquire a person’s location data and personal information. At least one of these companies, Penlink, has contracted with ICE, so it’s possible ICE is using geolocation data to track people’s location.
Penlink didn’t respond to the Reformer’s request for comment about whether their surveillance systems were being used by ICE to track Minnesotans.
Data privacy advocates are alleging that federal agents are using private data to intimidate observers and activists during “Operation Metro Surge,” MPR News earlier this week reported.
“Data is being weaponized,” Boehler said. “It’s being weaponized by a hostile federal government, and that was always the intended use for all that data collection.”
How do I use the Minnesota law to keep my data private?
Minnesota residents will need to reach out to individual companies. They can ask to obtain a list of third parties to whom their data was sold; tell a business “no” to selling their data; obtain a copy of what sensitive information a company has about them; and demand that a company delete the personal information it has about them.
The company must respond to their request within 45 days, and they could face a $7,500 fine per violation of the Minnesota Consumer Data Privacy Act. The Minnesota Attorney General’s Office is responsible for enforcing the law, and people can use AG forms to send to companies.
The most all-encompassing measure a person can take is to download a “universal opt out mechanism” onto their internet browser. This allows your browser to send a signal that tells websites you visit that you don’t want your data sold.
Most data brokers are subject to Minnesota’s law, but the state doesn’t have a list of brokers that operate in Minnesota. California, however, keeps a list of data brokers that operate there. A person could start with that list, as many of those brokers also do business in Minnesota.
Businesses that control or process the personal data of 100,000 Minnesota consumers or more are subject to the Minnesota law. In addition, companies that process personal data of 25,000 Minnesotans and derive over 25% of their gross revenues from the sale of the data are also subject to the law.
The process is wonky, and Minnesota lawmakers, who convene for the 2026 session next month, would need to act if they wanted to make it easier for everyday Minnesotans to utilize this law.
The Attorney General has a Q&A and forms on its site that you can use as templates for requests to companies.

(Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada Current)Nevada is looking for ways to break away from a decades-long dependence on California fuel as the Golden State experiences refinery closures — including the back-to-back closures of two major oil refineries.
In October, Phillips 66 produced its final barrel of fuel at its Los Angeles facility, citing regulatory pressure, rising costs, and declining gasoline demand in California. Valero Energy also announced plans to close its oil refinery near San Francisco by April, citing similar reasons.
Together, the two facilities represent about 17% of California’s capacity to refine crude oil into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other petroleum products. 
Nevada — which imports about 86% of its transportation fuels from California — will likely feel the impacts of those closures, including price hikes at the pump, say industry experts.
Nevada’s Fuel Resiliency Committee, which had its first meeting last week, was proposed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo to help address the state’s current and emerging fuel challenges. And there are many.
For one, Nevada doesn’t have any significant crude oil reserves. In 2024, the state only produced about 170,000 barrels — a literal drop in the barrel compared to U.S. production of nearly 14 million barrels per day.
Nevada also has only one crude oil refinery located in Nye County, which is limited to producing asphalt for roads. Additionally, Nevada doesn’t have the capacity to store large quantities of fuel in cases of emergency like California does.
As a result, Nevada relies almost entirely on imported transportation fuels from California, leaving the state vulnerable to supply disruptions from the neighboring state.
Nevada isn’t alone. California refineries supply more than one-third of transportation fuel in the neighboring state of Arizona, which also doesn’t have significant oil reserves or a single crude oil refinery.
In general, California and the West Coast is geographically isolated from other refining centers, notably the Gulf Coast where 55% of U.S. refining capacity is located, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That makes it difficult for Nevada to draw supply from other regions.
Miranda Hoover, the state executive for the Energy and Convenience Association of Nevada, said it’s clear Nevada will need to diversify its fuel supply sources to build resiliency. Hoover said she has been working with Lombardo on fuel affordability for the past four years and is now serving as a non-voting member for the Nevada Fuel Resiliency Committee.
“We’ve done a lot of research on if it would even be possible or plausible for Nevada to have its own refinery. Unfortunately, the simple answer is no,” said Hoover, whose trade association represents fuel distributors, transporters, and gas stations. “Nevada doesn’t have any of the right crude oil that could even be put into the refinery.”
The subcommittee will be tasked with conducting assessments of Nevada’s current and projected fuel supply, exploring options to expand infrastructure, assessing the state’s vulnerabilities, and strengthening emergency responses. The committee expects to submit its recommended policies in September. Part of those recommendations will likely include plans to expand permitting and addressing barriers to infrastructure projects, said Hoover.
One major solution that is being pushed on the committee is more pipelines. 
Nevada relies on three major pipelines: Kinder Morgan’s CALNEV pipeline which supplies 90% of Southern Nevada’s fuel, H.F. Sinclair’s UNEV Pipeline which pipes about 15% of Nevada’s total fuel from Utah, and Kinder Morgan’s SFPP North Line from California which fuels the Reno area.
Representatives for several fuel companies with tentative plans to expand pipelines into Nevada, including H.F. Sinclair and Phillips 66, serve as non voting members on the Fuel Resiliency Committee.
In October, HF Sinclair announced that it was evaluating an expansion of its UNEV Pipeline from Utah that could increase capacity into Las Vegas by about 35,000 barrels a day by moving more fuel from the Rockies into Nevada. That plan would also include a new lateral line from Utah to Reno — which has a single pipeline for its gasoline and diesel supply.
That same month, Phillips 66 and Kinder Morgan announced they were accepting shipper commitments for their Western Gateway Pipeline, a 1,300 mile pipeline from Texas that would supply gasoline to California, Arizona and Nevada. If built, the pipeline would be the first to pipe refined fuels to California from outside the state.
During the committee’s first meeting, Hoover said several fuel companies gave updates about potential infrastructure projects that could expand Nevada’s supply of refined fuels.
“To truly be resilient, we must diversify. That means we can’t have just one new pipeline coming into Las Vegas. It’s probably going to be two and or three multiple projects or infrastructure improvements that are going to really create not only short term solutions, but also long term solutions,” Hoover said.
Brett Compston, administrator of the Nevada Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security and chair of the committee, highlighted that the committee was created under the Nevada Department of Homeland Security because the state’s reliance on California fuel is impacting the state’s military bases.
“Right now, one of the things I worry about or we worry about for the emergency management and the homeland security side is disruption to critical infrastructure, in this case, fuel,” said Compston, during the committee hearing last week.
In 2023, Gov. Joe Lombardo declared a state of emergency when Kinder Morgan’s CALNEV pipeline, which serves Nellis and Edwards Air Force bases and McCarran International Airport, was temporarily shut down because of a California wildfire.
Earlier this year, wildfires in California also caused widespread power outages, shutting down two pipelines that send fuel to Nevada and Arizona.
The infrastructure plans to expand pipelines into Nevada would likely take years, if constructed at all. HF Sinclair’s UNEV Pipeline expansion wouldn’t be complete until 2028, while Phillips 66 and Kinder Morgan’s Western Gateway Pipeline would be completed in 2029.
Gaps in fuel resiliency, and the years it could take to address them, is especially concerning for rural and northern Nevada, said state Sen. Robin Titus, who serves as a voting member on the committee. 
“I think we raised more questions than we had answers the other day,” Titus said of the first committee meeting.
Last year, Titus sponsored Senate Bill 505 to establish an Energy Independence Task Force to explore alternatives to relying on California fuel, but the bill never got a hearing.
Titus said she hopes the Fuel Resiliency Committee can explore more immediate solutions, including expanding storage capacity in the state to mitigate moments of fuel volatility. In the long-term, Nevada will need to move away from depending almost entirely on California fuel, Titus said.
“What they do in California impacts us here. Many of us in rural areas can’t get across the state in an electric car. There’s no public transportation or anything out here, so we’re reliant on our cars to get places. Our needs are different, and so we want to make sure that we aren’t dependent on what happens in California,” Titus said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gasmo-1024x723.jpg,,,2026-01-20 08:57:01.151972

(Photo by Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana represents the heartland of America. It’s a place where community ties run deep, where neighbors look out for each other, and where common sense and hard work define the character of its people. That’s why, with Indiana’s 2026 legislative session underway, Defend Forgotten America commissioned a poll of Hoosiers.
As a nonpartisan organization committed to elevating the voices of heartland communities too often overlooked in national debates, we wanted to understand what Hoosiers truly need and what they’re asking their leaders to prioritize.
The statewide poll, conducted in early December by the respected national pollster Public Opinion Strategies, reveals a clear message to lawmakers as they kick off the second part of the session. Hoosiers, regardless of party affiliation, are unified around the urgent need to increase investment in health care access and protect local hospitals.
Nearly three-quarters of all voters — 73% — agree that the Indiana state government should do more to protect hospitals in local communities, with 45% strongly agreeing. This sentiment crosses party lines, with more than two-thirds of both Republicans and Democrats supporting greater hospital protections.
Indiana unveils multi-year rural health plan in newly released federal application

Unsurprisingly, they are greatly concerned about proposed cuts to Indiana’s Medicaid program. Nearly half of Hoosiers have heard about plans to cut over $1 billion annually from the state’s Medicaid program, and the response is striking: 71% oppose these cuts, including 57% who strongly oppose them. Majorities of Republicans, independents, and Democrats alike oppose the proposed reductions, as do nearly two-thirds of rural Hoosiers.
Hoosiers worry about rural residents losing health care access, local hospitals eliminating critical services, emergency room overcrowding, and rural women losing access to OBGYNs. Between 86% and 90% of voters express concern about each of these potential impacts, with roughly 40% very concerned about each.
These fears reflect real challenges already facing Indiana’s health care landscape. Fully 91% of Hoosiers say helping residents manage chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease is important to improving public health, with 76% calling it very important. This becomes out of reach for many communities as rural health collapses. Four rural hospitals have closed in recent years, and more are at risk of closure.
This is not just a problem in Indiana as a similar crisis in rural health care has unfolded across the country. In small towns across rural America, families worry that their local hospital might not be there tomorrow. Clinics are shutting down, women travel hours for prenatal checkups, and emergency rooms are stretched to capacity.
The poll also reveals other pressing concerns on Hoosiers’ minds. Groceries and everyday essentials are putting the most pressure on household budgets. On education, only 25% rate Indiana’s public schools as excellent or good, with residents most focused on strengthening college and career readiness and improving teacher pay. And on infrastructure, deteriorating local roads emerge as the biggest concern, with 35% identifying this as their top problem.
Though most Hoosiers believe the state is on the wrong track, our poll offers a path for leaders to bring back a sense of optimism to the state. By prioritizing the concerns that unite their constituents and turning their priorities into action, the 2026 legislative session offers an opportunity for Indiana to take bold action that forgotten communities are demanding across the country.

Our adopted home state has become a destination for right-wing tourists, who are now harassing Somali social service providers responsible for looking after the most vulnerable in our community.
Right-wing influencers from Washington state to Maine are knocking on child care center doors operated by Somali Americans, asking to see the children. This comes after Nick Shirley, a MAGA influencer and YouTuber, posted a 42-minute video on X on December 26, accusing Somali child care centers in the Twin Cities of committing more than $100 million in fraud after visiting 10 centers in a single day. That video has been viewed 140 million times, and has been shared by Elon Musk and Vice President J.D. Vance. 
As someone who has worked as a fraud investigator in the Medicaid Fraud Division of the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, I can tell you Shirley doesn’t know the first thing about this type of fraud or how to investigate it. 
Fraud occurs when the provider bills the state for services they never provided. This is why investigators submit requests for claims data weeks after conducting surveillance. In Minnesota, child care fraud is investigated by special agents from the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. Fraud in adult daycare and other programs funded by Medicaid are investigated by the Attorney General’s Medicaid Fraud Division.
Investigators must review and document hundreds of hours of surveillance footage from pole cameras to prove how many recipients received services at a particular facility and compare that data to claims submitted by the provider to find overbilling. They then have to interview numerous recipients to find which recipients didn’t receive services.
Generally, law enforcement is conducting their investigation while the fraud is ongoing, and must not arouse suspicion for fear pertinent records may be destroyed. Prosecutors can only charge what they can prove, which is often a small portion of the overall fraud scheme. 
Investigators cannot credibly state in open court that all proceeds received by a provider were fraudulently obtained because they observed no services being rendered the day they conducted surveillance, which is how Shirley tabulated the amount of fraud he claims he uncovered. 
On January 14, Shirley posted another video to social media claiming to have unearthed even more fraud. This time, he visited non-emergency medical transportation businesses operated by Somali Americans in the Twin Cities and claimed to have discovered $16 million in fraud because he could not locate several of the companies, concluding that they must be operating fraudulently.
If Shirley was serious about locating those providers, he could have contacted the Department of Human Services to find the correct addresses. Shirely relied on the Secretary of State’s website, which from my experience is not always accurate because businesses fail to update their contact information.
Transportation fraud is difficult to uncover and is not as easy to detect as Shirley would have you believe. He surmises that non-medical transportation companies without vehicles in their parking lot must be committing fraud. From my experience, these companies hire employees who use their personal vehicles to provide rides to medical appointments. So it would not be a surprise that they would not be sitting at the company’s parking lot. He also insinuates that because some of the vehicles at the transportation company’s parking lot have not been moved for some time, they must be committing fraud. Again, the fraud would occur when the company bills for services that are not rendered. 
During my time working as a fraud investigator at the Attorney General’s Office, my colleagues and I investigated provider, interpreter and transportation fraud in a case known as PIT Stop. Non-emergency medical transportation drivers and interpreters from the Somali community colluded with health providers, who were in need of clients for their struggling businesses. In this scheme, hundreds of Somali Americans recipients from the Faribault area had their identities fraudulently used by drivers, interpreters and health providers. 
Granted, the standard of journalistic evidence is different from the standard of legal evidence, but the principle is the same, and if Shirley had an ethical editor they would have told him his work was incomplete, at best. 
A stopped clock is right twice a day, however, and Shirley does seem to have stumbled on to something. Local reporters at the Star Tribune and KARE-11 looked for ties between the care featured in Shirley’s video and the Feeding Our Future fraud. That’s how we now know that seven of the child care centers visited by Shirley served as meal sites that received $6.3 million from Feeding Our Future after claiming to have served 2.8 million meals between 2018 and 2021. 
The Reformer was the first to report in the summer of 2023 that nearly half of the 60 defendants charged in the Feeding Our Future fraud at the time had billed the state for other services, including child care. Since then, federal prosecutors have charged 18 additional defendants in the federal meals program fraud and more than a dozen for defrauding programs intended to provide autism services to children and housing assistance to the homeless. 
This means that once again, the administration of Gov. Tim Walz failed to do the most basic due diligence by continuing to pay providers who had ties to Feeding Our Future. 
Which raises the question: Why weren’t they more aggressive about stopping this sooner?
Because of politics and race. In July 2024, I explained how fraudsters leveraged the burgeoning political power of the Somali community by weaponizing race and religion to escape accountability. 
Early last year, a recorded conversation between Attorney General Keith Ellision with several Somali individuals, two of whom would be charged in the Feeding Our Future fraud, was released. The audio, recorded in December 2021, was surreptitiously recorded by one of the charged individuals, and was listed in a trial exhibit. 
In the 54-minute recording, Ellison agrees with the individuals lobbying him that state agencies are discriminating against East African providers. Ellison states that Walz agrees with him that too much focus on compliance is hurting small businesses. 
One individual can be heard telling Ellison that the Somali community will use its votes and money to get behind politicians who will support the community’s efforts to impede state agencies who he says are targeting Somali providers. 
Within 10 days of this meeting, Ellison and his son, a Minneapolis council member at the time, received $17,500 from Somali Americans participating in the federal child nutrition program, many of whom would be charged with defrauding the federal child nutrition program. (To his credit, Ellison can be heard on the audio rebuffing their offers to help him with campaign donations.)
During the second Feeding Our Future trial, one of the defendants, who prosecutors presented as a witness, testified that fraudsters used state Sen. Omar Fateh to hinder the Minnesota Department of Education’s efforts to stop the fraud by smearing the agency as racist. 
Fateh, who accused state agencies of discrimination in December 2021 in a public forum attended by members of the Somali community, announced he would return $11,000 in campaign donations days after federal agents executed a bevy of search warrants tied to the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme in January 2022. Since then, he has returned thousands of more dollars in campaign donations from individuals who have been charged. 
Jim Nobles, who served as Minnesota’s non-partisan legislative auditor for 38 years before retiring in 2021, gently suggested last year that political cowardice was at the root of the failure of vigilance when it came to the theft of state and federal money. Democrats didn’t want public hearings when he conducted audits that might be embarrassing for the Somali community, he wrote in an op-ed in October.  
The late House Speaker Melissa Hortman “acknowledged that some members of her caucus were upset” because they “felt that Office of Legislative Auditor reports were subjecting human service programs to too much criticism, particularly programs administered by Somali community organizations.” 
Paradoxically, these efforts to protect the Somali community now threaten to destroy us. Now we’re enduring a wave of masked immigration agents — sent under the pretext of stamping out immigration and public services fraud, including in the Somali community. 
When Minnesota Democrats allowed fraud to run rampant in our public programs, tarnishing our state and my community’s image in the process, they started a chain of unfortunate events that led us here. God help us.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NN251208_547-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 07:59:31.337808

When Purcell was convinced to come out of retirement this past fall to teach at Mackinaw City High School, he saw a remarkable difference teaching students in a district that had long banned cell phone use during the school day.
“It makes a world of difference when there is a school wide policy that is enforced by all the teachers consistently and supported by the administration,” said Purcell, who has taught math, been an academic counselor and served as an assistant principal throughout his career. “Students have and always will find ways to be distracted from the learning, but not having cell phones may take away the biggest distraction that students face.”
Mackinaw City Public Schools’ cell phone ban was instituted around 2010, coinciding with the rise of teen cell phone ownership, longtime Superintendent Jeffrey Curth said. 
Teachers have all taken on the responsibility of enforcing that students’ cell phones are left in their locker with the ringer off from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m, Curth said, removing a major source of distractions and potential source of cyber bullying.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Because we’ve just had it in place so long, it’s just what’s expected,” Curth said. “I think when you see the amount of cyber bullying and things that it’s raised to the level that it has in society today, I think it’s just further strengthened our stance that we feel that we’ve done the right thing.”
As the state considers a school cell phone ban that received overwhelming bipartisan support in the Michigan House last week, an increasing number of Michigan school districts have followed Mackinaw City’s lead by enacting bans and passing cell phone policies limiting use in the classroom in recent years.
Nationwide, 26 states have passed full bans on cell phone use, while six others have required districts to establish their own policies or limited cell phone use in class, according to Newsweek. A 2024 American Association of Educators survey of 1,517 teachers from across the country, on the other hand, found that 70% want cellphones to be banned during the school day.
From passive presence to active participation
Anchor Bay High School student success teacher Jamie Pietron said she was initially apprehensive about how students would adjust to the districtwide ban that started this fall, wondering how the policy would be enforced by administration.
There have been consequences for students who violate the district’s “away for the day” cell phone policy, Pietron said, helping contribute to a more connected learning atmosphere.
“In the past, when kids were done with their work, they went on their phones,” Pietron said. “Teachers are making lessons and activities more engaging to cover any ‘down time’ and students are focused on what they need to do. 
“… It is amazing to walk through the cafeteria and see kids actually talking, playing cards and having conversations with each other instead of staring at their screens.”

Northville Middle School teacher Richard Tabor said he also has seen a shift from “passive presence” to active participation in his classroom since the district enacted its cell phone ban in 2024-25 for students in grades K-8 during class time, requiring them to be collected by teachers at the start of the day.
Prior to the ban being in place, Tabor said it was teachers’ responsibility to enforce their own policies on student cell phone use, leading to inconsistency in where students were allowed to use cell phones and where they weren’t.
Without the option to scroll during downtime, students are able to engage with the classroom environment,” Tabor said. “Students are more likely to ask questions, take physical notes and participate in discussions because they have no alternative ‘escape’ during moments of boredom or difficulty.”
Mackinaw City special education teacher Elizabeth McNeil said her transition from teaching in a district without a cell phone policy to one where a ban has long been in place has been a “breath of fresh air” in removing “distraction and drama.”
“At my previous district, there were daily arguments about giving up phones and discipline problems, even when just asking a student to put their phone away,” she said.
“In a society where adults are addicted to their phones, it is encouraging to see that we are encouraging students here at MCPS to realize that their phones are not part of their lifeline,” McNeil said”
Parental approval
Beyond support from teachers, bans have largely been met with approval from parents, who acknowledge that devices that continually cause them distractions throughout the day shouldn’t be in the hands of their children during school.
Heather Gatny’s opinion has evolved on the issue, from trying to hold off on getting her son a cell phone until he is in high school to recently getting him one as an eighth grader for Christmas.
She likes the idea of him having one in his possession, even if it is kept off while he is in class at Plymouth-Canton Community Schools, but stressed that in the classroom it can only cause distractions.
“If the kids were allowed to have their phones in the classrooms, they’d be looking at them the whole time,” she said. “I think that’s for the best for them to not have access to it, because they’re just on apps. They’re goofing around. They’re not paying attention to what the teacher is saying. They’re paying attention to what their friends are texting them.”
With two young children in second and fourth grades at Plymouth-Canton Community Schools, Sarah Krzyzanski said she is for cell phones being stored in a central location in the classroom for those who are concerned about students being able to respond to an emergency.
In the classroom, however, she said schools should be aiming to keep the focus on learning and not conditioning students to be dependent on having a cell phone by their side.
“These kids are at the point where they’re kind of addicted to that ‘ding,’ and they get to where they crave it, and it becomes an impulse,” she said. “I don’t believe that a child with a phone on their person has the ability to pay attention to the teacher and actually follow lessons and do it with enough of their brain engaged to be taking that educational content out the way that they should be.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2193693341-e1757087878361-700x467-1.jpg,,,2026-01-20 07:59:31.337808

(Photo by Doug Wilson via Getty Images)Indiana firefighters logged elevated levels of potentially hazardous PFAS chemicals in their blood serum, the state has found — with some connections to the frequency with which they handled firefighting foam, protective gear and specialized emergency responses.
PFAS is an abbreviation for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. They have water, oil and heat-resistant properties but have been linked to health effects including potential increased risk of cancer.
The study, conducted by the Indiana Department of Homeland Security and external diagnostic laboratory Eurofins Scientific, was authorized in House Enrolled Act 1219 from 2023. The results were prepared by consultant Delineate and released last week, although the report is dated November.
More states ban PFAS, or ‘forever chemicals,’ in more products

“These findings confirm what firefighters and their families have been raising alarms about for years,” said the law’s author, Rep. Maureen Bauer, in a news release. “PFAS exposure is not isolated. It is systemic, occupational, and statewide. Because of (House Enrolled Act) 1219, we now have real data instead of unanswered questions.”
“Biomonitoring is about prevention and accountability,” added Bauer, D-South Bend. “You cannot fix what you do not measure. This program gives us the tools to protect the people who protect us.”
About 930 Hoosier firefighters — mostly active but some retired — responded to an initial online survey launched August of 2024 about their demographics, occupational history, potential exposure and more.
Respondents primarily served municipal fire departments, with about a quarter stationed in volunteer or combination departments and small numbers working for airports or industry, according to the report.
They were largely highly experienced, with 70% serving 15 years or more.
Testing performed
Of the 485 who reconsented to blood testing following procedural changes, 380 were selected in stratified random sampling and 316 returned their kits.
The samples were tested for 45 different PFAS analytes.
Most — 88% — had between 2 and 20 nanograms per milliliter of PFAS in their blood, putting them at medium risk of potential adverse health effects.
About 8.5% of those tested were in the low risk category, while 3.5% — all with 15 years or more of experience — were living at high risk.
The highest results were observed in two northwest Indiana Preparedness Districts, while the lowest came out of an east-central district.

Frequent exposure to PFAS-containing firefighting foams, which was self-reported, was statistically significantly associated with higher blood PFAS.
So was frequent contact with PFAS-containing equipment or gear, particularly among those handling or wearing gear on most or all shifts.
Residue on gear, along with dust in fire stations, can also contain PFAS.
Researchers observed a statistically significant association between how often firefighters decontaminated their gear and their biomarker category.
Firefighters who reported cleaning their gear after every exposure showed a modestly higher proportion of lower-level PFAS results, and those who rarely or never decontaminated it tended to cluster in the medium- or high-risk categories.
There was a similar trend for self-decontamination — like handwashing or showering — but it wasn’t statistically signifiant, according to the report.
Firefighters who frequently participated in hazardous materials response, water emergencies, construction-related rescues and other specialized tasks also recorded slightly higher PFAS concentrations.
About three-quarters of respondents reported at least some knowledge of PFAS safety, leaving a quarter with no awareness at all. Nearly all were at least moderately concerned about PFAS risks — especially those in higher-risk categories — but most hadn’t completed any safety training.
“This combination, broad concern and limited formal training, suggests strong receptivity to practical guidance, standardized procedures and targeted education at the department and state levels,” researchers wrote.
Recommendations made
The report called the results a “foundation” for further study.
“This pilot establishes an initial, preliminary baseline understanding of PFAS levels in a targeted population of Indiana firefighters,” researchers wrote. “While these data are not conclusive, they serve as a foundation for future, larger-scale efforts, enabling longitudinal studies that track changes in PFAS levels over time and correlate them with health outcomes.”
They recommended a variety of ways to reduce inhalation, skin and hand-to-mouth PFAS exposure: on-scene decontamination, bagging gear after use and laundering it promptly, keeping gear out of living spaces, HEPA-filtered vacuuming and wet-mopping, dedicated extractors and more.
They also aimed some suggestions at PFAS-containing foams: using non-PFAS alternatives “where mission-appropriate,” avoiding foams in training, pre-planning “containment” for emergency foam use and so on.
There are no approved medical treatments to remove PFAS from the body.

Formal safety training was another recommendation.
All active and retired firefighters should have access to voluntary serum testing, possibly with an exposure history survey, per the report.
But the state should also expand the scope of testing to measure non-occupational exposure, like how close respondents live to industrial sites, their primary drinking water sources and dietary habits — and sample for PFAS contamination in fire station dust, turnout gear, apparatus cabs and training grounds, researchers said.
The Indiana Department of Environmental Management could pursue federal and other grants to fund such work.
The study acknowledged some limitations, like challenges in establishing a baseline for PFAS levels.
New protocols for handling participant data were also introduced partway through the pilot, requiring a reconsent form. It came with delays and researchers “lost nearly half … of our sample,” limiting the data analysis they could perform.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents showed up to a Star City Mall in St. Cloud last week to target the Somali community for so-called “immigration enforcement.” Federal agents used chemical irritants and brandished firearms against people gathered to protest what they characterized as racial profiling. 
Witnesses described agents pointing firearms at unarmed citizen-observers and elected officials, turning a community center into a militarized zone of fear. The violence escalated further when, as reported by KSTP, an ICE agent was caught on video attacking a bystander named Chase Benjamin with a baton in the mall parking lot, underscoring the agency’s indiscriminate use of force. 
The ‘operation’ was chaotic. On their way out, they recklessly sped vehicles through the crowd of bystanders.
The raid resulted in at least three arrests and widespread fear among residents. Local officials present on the scene — state Sen. Aric Putnam, City Council Member Hudda Ibrahim, and DFL District 6 Chair Chantal Oechsle — all condemned the tactics as a politically-motivated occupation rather than legitimate enforcement, criticizing the deployment of dozens of agents to a peaceful neighborhood strip mall. 
St. Cloud police received no advance notice, underscoring ICE’s disregard for local law enforcement. To see such brazen disregard for human safety by ICE in a community I once called home is enraging. At this very Somali mall, I used to purchase groceries, get my prescriptions from Afya Pharmacy, eat at the restaurants and pray in the mosque there. 
The Pew Research Center reports that, as of 2023, Minnesota’s unauthorized immigrant population was  estimated at 130,000, accounting for approximately 2.2% of all state residents, notably lower than the national average. We do not have a serious undocumented immigration problem in Minnesota. Moreover, as the Reformer has reported, roughly 90% of Somalis in Minnesota are U.S. citizens, 
So, why is a militarized ICE terrorizing Minnesotans? 
As a St. Cloud State alumnus and former St. Cloud resident of a combined eight years, I am horrified by the potentially unconstitutional manner in which ICE conducted itself in St. Cloud. As a father of children, who are descendants of both Norwegian and Somali immigrants, I fear for their safety and the safety of all Minnesotans. ICE is retraumatizing St. Cloud’s Muslim residents, compounding the fear in a city already scarred by a history of Islamophobia.
Following the fatal shooting of Renée Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross in Minnesota and subsequent raids in this month, public approval for the agency has dropped sharply, with 51% of Americans deeming ICE’s current tactics “too forceful,” according to a recent YouGov poll. A Quinnipiac University poll revealed that 57% of voters disapproved of ICE enforcement of immigration laws, while only 39% approved. According to an NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist College poll, 54% of Americans believe that ICE has “gone too far” in its enforcement of immigration laws. Recently, a CNN poll indicated that 53% of Americans oppose President Trump’s proposed expansion of ICE funding, while only 31% expressed support. In a YouGov poll from Jan 14, 2026, 53% of Americans think agent Ross should face criminal charges for the shooting of Ms. Good, whereas only 30% responded that he shouldn’t be charged.  
In short, Americans are done with ICE, especially Minnesotans. As far back as a June Star Tribune poll and a more recent KSTP poll, a majority oppose Trump’s immigration policies.  
Somali Minnesotans are just like their neighbors — they work and pay taxes and contribute in other ways. According to Bruce Corrie of Concordia University St. Paul, Somali Minnesotans generate at least $500 million in income yearly. Somalis pay approximately $67 million in state and local taxes, and Somalis have an estimated $8 billion impact on the state’s economy. 
These tax-paying Americans should not have to fear a police state. If this ICE surge is some kind of revenge for fraud, doesn’t targeting the entire Somali-American community for the criminal fraud perpetrated by a few individuals constitute immoral collective punishment that violates the core American and international legal principles of presumption of innocence and protection from arbitrary detention? The militarized terror inflicted upon our neighbors is not only a violation of American and international civil liberties but an affront to the sacred values held by Minnesota’s diverse faith communities. 
In the Old Testament, the moral mandate is clear and repetitive: “You shall not oppress a foreigner, you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners” (Exodus 23:9), a call to empathy born from the memory of one’s own displacement. 
This is echoed in the Gospel, where the Biblical Jesus explicitly aligns himself with the outcast, stating, “I was a stranger and you took me in” (Matthew 25:35). Islam similarly elevates the protection of the Ibn al-Sabīl (the migrant), commands believers to stand firmly for justice, and to be witnesses of injustice for God, even if it is against their own kin (Qurʾān 4:135, cf. 2:177, 2:215, 4:36, 8:41, 9:60, 17:26, 30:38, 59:7). 
When militarized agents storm our cities, forcefully enter our homes without judicial warrants and deploy chemical irritants against peaceful families, they violate this shared Abrahamic duty to offer sanctuary. The United States cannot claim to be a moral authority while allowing the machinery of ICE to tear apart the very families we are commanded to aid and protect; our Abrahamic heritage demands we stand between the oppressor and the oppressed. 
To truly uphold that heritage and address our nation’s moral dilemma, we must heed Martin Luther King III’s reflection on the recent state violence in Minneapolis: “It feels like humanity has left,” and our charge now “really is once again redeeming the soul of America.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_351-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 07:59:31.337808

Brad Hudson, pictured speaking during special session Sept. 12, 2025, is proposing an expansion to the MOScholars program that would “significantly increase the amount of funding needed for the program,"" according to the bill's fiscal note. His bill is the first to be heard at the committee level proposing changes to MOScholars (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri lawmakers are considering expanding the state’s private school voucher program with proposals to open eligibility and remove demands on private schools who accept voucher funds.
But the program, which has spent a majority of the $50 million it received in state funding this fiscal year, may lack room to grow with Gov. Mike Kehoe proposing only a small bump for MOScholars alongside a cut of $600 million from the state budget.
MOScholars uses state money, funded directly in the state budget and indirectly through tax-credit donations, to subsidize K-12 education outside a student’s local public school. The program is largely used to fund private, religious education. But some homeschool families use the funds to buy supplies, and a couple students have used the funds to enroll in neighboring public schools.
The program is in its fourth year and provides scholarships to over 6,000 students, thanks in large part to an infusion of $50 million of general revenue last year.
State Treasurer Vivek Malek, pictured speaking during the Disability Advocacy Day rally in the Missouri State Capitol rotunda Feb. 25, 2025, oversees the MOScholars program. Malek’s office is seeking to more than double the number of students served by MOScholars (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
State Treasurer Vivek Malek, whose office oversees MOScholars, wants to keep the momentum going this upcoming fiscal year. His office asked for $100 million in its budget request for the program, seeking to provide funding for 13,000 students next school year.
Kehoe, who lauded the program’s success in his State of the State speech Tuesday, budgeted $60 million in state funds to MOScholars.
“This program is working,” he said, “and Missouri families are counting on it.”
Malek’s office has already spent nearly $40 million on scholarships this fiscal year, according to the Missouri Accountability Portal. Most students with MOScholars funding return the next year, so without funding above and beyond last year’s appropriation, the program will not be able to offer scholarships to many new students.
Despite this funding challenge, the Senate Education Committee appears poised to prioritize MOScholars expansion.
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Republican from Harrisonville, chairs the committee and has spoken in strong support of MOScholars. His children attend Summit Christian Academy, a school that received $727,000 from the program in its first three years.
Among the first bills Brattin selected for a hearing Tuesday was a proposal by state Sen. Brad Hudson, a Republican from Cape Fair, to open eligibility to students already enrolled in private schools.
In the bill’s fiscal note, the treasurer’s office warns the legislation would “significantly increase the amount of funding needed for the program.”
Currently, eligibility for MOScholars is multi-pronged.
Students with an individualized education plan, which public schools administer to students with disabilities requiring accommodations, can apply without restrictions on family income. Students who qualify for free or reduced price lunch are eligible as long as they have attended public school for at least one semester in the past year or are entering kindergarten or first grade. Siblings of MOScholars recipients are also eligible.
Heather Smith, a mother from Cass County, told the committee the expansion would help families like hers. She told them about her son, who struggled in the local public school but “thrived” with the smaller classroom size at Summit Christian Academy.
“The financial strain has been absolutely crushing to our family,” she said.
This school year, her family couldn’t afford the private school tuition. But since her son has been out of public school for over a year, he doesn’t qualify for MOScholars.
“(School) should absolutely be a parent’s choice,” Smith said. “And that choice should not bring a family so far underwater financially that there is little to no way out.”
The bill also seeks to expand eligibility to students with disabilities diagnosed by a medical provider, but it does not define disability nor specify what types of conditions would be covered.
In addition to expanding program eligibility, Hudson’s bill would require judges to allow organizations representing parents to intervene in cases challenging the MOScholars statute. Currently, EdChoice, a nonprofit organization that advocates for school vouchers and similar programs, is an intervener in a case challenging the state’s use of general revenue to fund MOScholars.
Hudson’s bill also seeks to bar administrative rules that would place requirements on schools accepting MOScholars students.
The Missouri House is not set to move MOScholars bills early in the legislative session, with its education committee concentrating on matters affecting public schools.
Moberly Republican state Rep. Ed Lewis, the committee chairman and a former public school teacher, said in the committee’s first meeting Wednesday that he is focusing on teacher certification and retention, literacy and transparency and accountability in public education.
The committee will consider bills outside of these topics, he said, adding: “We want to make sure that we focus on those things this session to try to move education in Missouri forward.”
Some bills seek to reign in MOScholars, adding requirements for private schools to be eligible to receive program funds.
A bill filed by state Sen. Barbara Washington, a Democrat from Kansas City, would require charter schools and private schools accepting MOScholars funds to follow accreditation and accountability measures set by the state, among other requirements.
Similarly, a bill by state Rep. Mark Boyko, a Democrat from Kirkwood, private schools with MOScholars students would be required to follow safety requirements, like teaching CPR in high schools and screening for dyslexia.
“If a school is being supported with state dollars, then I think it’s important that the state takes responsibility for the safety of those students, just like they would a public school student,” Boyko told The Independent.
He filed the bill last year, but it did not get a hearing. If MOScholars legislation makes it to the full House, Boyko said, he is open to adding his legislation as an amendment.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091225_hudson1-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-20 07:59:31.337808

Mike Kehoe’s State of the State address rested on a tension he never resolved. Missouri, he warned, is falling behind.

Yet in […]","Missouri Gov. MIke Kehoe waves after completing his 2026 State of the State address on Jan. 13, as House Speaker Jon Patterson claps in the foreground (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications). Gov. Mike Kehoe’s State of the State address rested on a tension he never resolved.
Missouri, he warned, is falling behind. Its population is “stagnant.” Economic growth over the past decade has been “average at best.” When competing with states like Texas and Tennessee, Missouri too often loses before the conversation even begins.
Yet in the same breath, Kehoe insisted Missouri has “already seen success” cutting taxes. Over the last decade, Missouri has trimmed the income and corporate taxes while eliminating the franchise and capital gains taxes. This argument did much of the heavy lifting for the signature proposal in the speech: a five-year phaseout of the individual income tax.
But if tax cuts are already delivering growth, why does Missouri still lag its peers?
And if the state is falling behind, why double down on a strategy that has yet to close the gap?
The governor never reconciled that contradiction, even as he dismissed critics who argue tax cuts have worsened the state’s budget outlook as people who “just want to spend more of your money.”
There is also a political reality left unspoken.
Republicans have controlled the Missouri legislature for more than two decades and the governor’s office since 2016. The conditions Kehoe now decries did not arise in a vacuum. His agenda is not a sharp break from the past so much as an escalation of it — a bet that going further down the same road will finally produce different results.
Kehoe attempted to reassure skeptics by drawing bright lines. He pledged he would “never support” extending sales taxes to agriculture, health care or real estate. He described his plan as deliberate, responsible and safeguarded against runaway sales taxes.
But the language of the constitutional amendment introduced in the Missouri House the day Kehoe gave his speech — the apparent vehicle for that tax-cut promise — tells a different story.
The proposal explicitly allows state and local sales and use taxes to be expanded “to impose taxes on transactions involving any goods and services” for the purpose of eliminating the income tax.
Any resulting tax increase would be exempt from Missouri’s constitutional revenue limits and Hancock Amendment protections, meaning lawmakers could raise or broaden taxes without triggering the usual requirement to take the issue to voters.
Missouri revenue surplus nearly gone as Gov. Mike Kehoe unveils his budget plan

All of this is unfolding as Kehoe warns, in stark terms, that the era of pandemic-era budget surpluses is over and that federal funds that once bolstered state coffers are no longer filling gaps. He proposes roughly $600 million in cuts to the core operating budget while warning that the state’s revenue surplus of $4.3 billion on June 30 will be only $4.7 million next year.
This is not abstract belt-tightening. Kehoe explicitly warned lawmakers against restoring cuts or slipping pet projects into the budget without identifying how to pay for them. The message was unmistakable: lean years are coming, and discipline will be enforced from the governor’s office.
That context makes his tax plan more controversial, not less. States that have successfully eliminated the individual income tax typically rely on alternative revenue streams to balance their budgets, such as oil and gas production, massive tourism economies or both.
Missouri has none of those advantages on a scale large enough to matter.
The coming months will reveal whether Kehoe’s foundation for growth is solid — or whether the cracks he papered over in this speech widen under fiscal pressure.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/011326-1635-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 06:57:38.196710

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)When former state Sen. Dick Codey died earlier this month, the first thing Louise Walpin thought of was his unsuccessful plea on the Senate floor in 2010 to legalize gay marriage.
If legislators didn’t pass it, Codey warned, the world would look back and wonder: “What were they thinking? What were they afraid of?”
Walpin, an LGBTQ activist, thinks the same will happen with the push to protect health care for the transgender community. Legislation that would have codified access to it failed to pass in the waning weeks of the last legislative session, so Walpin and other advocates now are counting on Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D) to shepherd the bill into law. Sherrill will be sworn in Tuesday at noon.
“I look at this from a historical perspective. In LGBTQ rights, we didn’t get marriage equality right away. There has never been an LGBTQ thing that has gone through just smoothly, where everyone says, ‘This is great! We love the language, so we’re going to accept it,’” Walpin said.
Sherrill didn’t say much on the campaign trail about this issue, other than offering broad statements of support for marginalized groups, including transgender people. Some in the community noticed.
Kathleen Gallinaro of Gloucester County has a son who socially transitioned at 13, began receiving testosterone at 16, and is now 19.
“The good in me wants to believe that she didn’t want to bring up something that has been so heavily politicized, because the bottom line is that people have politicized the lives of trans children and trans adults in a way that nobody should be reduced to. Human beings are not politics,” Gallinaro said.
Transgender people and their allies say the fight for protections remains more urgent than ever, as federal threats to the community escalate.
Congressional Republicans have tried to bar Medicaid coverage of all gender transition procedures, while the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority upheld a Tennessee law banning such care for minors. President Donald Trump’s administration has barred transgender people from serving in the military, declared genders are “not changeable,” and tried to block such care for minors, among other things. The federal threats have driven some New Jersey providers to end or scale back services for transgender people.
“They want all of us gone,” said Melissa Firstenberg, a transgender woman from Marlton. “It’s not about the children, for the people who would attack us. It never has been. It’s about their power. It’s about demonizing and dehumanizing a small portion of the population. We’ve just got to make sure that they’re not successful here in New Jersey.”

Sean Higgins, a Sherrill spokesman, told the New Jersey Monitor that Sherrill will keep a 2023 executive order in place in which outgoing Gov. Phil Murphy declared the denial of gender-affirming care a violation of anti-discrimination laws. Higgins said he would not comment on the health care bill because it is pending. Bill sponsor Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex) reintroduced it last week when the new legislative session began.
Jeannine Frisby LaRue, board chair for LGBTQ rights group Garden State Equality Action Fund, said she expects legislators to pass the bill by June — and Sherrill to sign it.
“If this bill takes a year to get to Gov. Mikie Sherrill’s desk, that’s not a win for us. That’s not a win,” LaRue said. “I spoke directly to Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill. She assured me that this is an issue that she cares about, and it’s a priority, and she said if the bill gets to her desk, she’s going to sign the bill.”
In New Jersey, threats to the transgender community have gone beyond health care.
The state has been in court since 2024 defending a state policy that advises school districts they can accept a student’s change in gender identity without notifying parents. Christin Heaps, the father challenging the guidance, has framed his fight as one of parental rights, while the state’s attorneys have centered students’ safety and rights in their arguments. Heaps sued the Delaware Valley Regional High School in Frenchtown for not alerting him in the fall of 2023 that his child, then a freshman, had changed their pronouns and name at school.
Heaps’ case took a big blow last week when a federal appeals court dismissed his request for an injunction that would have blocked districts from following the state guidance. Heaps and his family recently moved from Hunterdon County to Florida, according to a court filing. It’s unclear if he will continue to pursue any claim for damages against the district.
While that case may fizzle out, some LGBTQ advocates fear more New Jersey school districts could follow the lead of Colts Neck’s school board, which rejected the state guidance that prompted Heaps’ lawsuit and also passed a “parental bill of rights” policy in November. That policy requires school officials to notify parents of a change in their child’s pronouns or gender identity, which critics decry as “forced outing.” It also allows them to opt their child out of sex education and decline school counseling.
Despite those other battles, advocates agree the health care bill remains their top priority.
“When we look at inclusion and these other issues, these are battles that will need to be undertaken by our community and our allies,” Firstenberg said. “But first, we need to make sure that we have the right to exist, and that’s what this health care battle is about. At its very core, this is a question about, do trans people have the right to exist?”
The bill would codify Murphy’s executive order and shield patients and providers of gender-affirming and reproductive health care from civil and criminal liability; it defines the former as all health care, including medication, related to the treatment of gender dysphoria and gender incongruence. It has been stalled in the Statehouse since Ruiz introduced it in June 2024, even though it has widespread legislative support (nearly half of each chamber signed on as sponsors), amid disagreement among advocates and lawmakers about the bill’s verbiage.
Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex), who controls what bills move in the lower chamber, told reporters last week that lawmakers and stakeholders were close to agreeing on the bill’s verbiage, but “complicated” legislation takes time.
“There’s lots of conversations and proposed languages that make drafts go back and forth, and sometimes, there’s loggerheads, and so it takes time to overcome those. It is alchemy. It’s not a pure science,” he said.
LaRue attributed some of the disagreement to how the bill would define gender-affirming care, with some advocates looking to avoid that phrase altogether over concerns it had become politicized. It’s a tricky balance, she said.
“I was the lead lobbyist on the Marriage Equality Act, and there were some folks who actually said to me, ‘I’ll never support the bill if the word marriage is in it.’ I’m like, well, excuse me, that’s the whole point of it,” LaRue said.

For the last several years, Republican lawmakers have sought to limit DEI in Wisconsin including by introducing bills that were vetoed by Gov. Tony Evers, holding hostage pay raises for the University of Wisconsin system employees during negotiations to limit DEI, and now, placing a constitutional amendment before voters. The efforts come as the Trump administration has also targeted DEI in the federal government and throughout the country.
“It’s just a larger attack that we’re seeing in this country against anything that uplifts our most marginalized communities…,” Chair of the Legislative Black Caucus Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee) told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview. “This started even before, you know, President Trump was elected. There’s just been a pushback with these programs and it’s because we’re starting to see some progress.” 
The Wisconsin State Senate will vote this week on a constitutional amendment that would prohibit local governments from “discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to” anyone based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. The proposal was first introduced and passed by the Republican-led Legislature in 2024. It is one of three constitutional amendment proposals that voters may have the final say on in November.
Drake has been seeking to increase awareness of the anti-DEI constitutional amendment over the last week.
Constitutional amendment proposals must pass two consecutive sessions of the state Legislature before they are  placed on ballots. In recent years, Republicans have, with mixed results, relied on constitutional amendment proposals to bypass Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.
If AJR 102 passes on Wednesday, voters will see the following question on their ballots in November: “Shall section 27 of article I of the constitution be created to prohibit governmental entities in the state from discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, public education, public contracting, or public administration?”
Authors of the amendment, including Rep. Dave Murphy (R-Hortonville), have said the proposal will restore “merit, fairness and equality to government practices from the state Capitol, all the way down to our school boards and everything in between.” It passed the Assembly last week. 
Drake counters that Republican lawmakers are misleading Wisconsinites.

“Legislative Republicans had the opportunity to expand economic and educational opportunities for all Wisconsinites. They’re the ones that have power, and yet they chose not to,” Drake said. “They are now trying to pin the reason why people are struggling on Black and brown people, women and other minority Wisconsinites for their failures by misleading people with what this ballot measure would do.”
Drake brought together Black leaders in Milwaukee including Mayor Cavalier Johnson and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, who is running for governor, to speak against the constitutional amendment proposal. 
Johnson said at the press conference that the city complies with state and federal law. 
“As mayor of a majority-minority city, I know firsthand that when every resident has the tools and every resident has the resources at their disposal to succeed, the entire community is strong,” he said. 
Drake has spoken about the risk of losing programs including the state’s Supplier Diversity Program, which was established in the 1980s and certifies minority-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned and woman-owned businesses to provide better opportunities for them to do business with the state of Wisconsin. She also says she thinks the proposal could have farther reaching consequences. For example, she said, she thinks the Holocaust education bill that lawmakers passed and Evers signed last session could be disallowed. That effort was approved in the same year that the state enacted legislation to require education on Hmong and Asian American history in schools.
“The reality is in the constitutional amendment resolution they’re putting forth, it applies for any type of public dollars, so… if our public schools and school boards put money towards that, in a way, you’re giving preferential treatment to teaching that specific history,” Drake said. “It’s so much more than just the programs… that Milwaukee county and the city have.”
“They’re saying that this constitutional amendment would prevent discrimination, but then it’s preventing the government from taking actions when discrimination actually happens, so essentially, you’re outlawing accountability when discrimination does occur,” Drake said. 
The Senate will vote on the proposal just days after Martin Luther King Day. Republican lawmakers have cited the civil rights leader’s teachings as justification for the amendment. 
“The principle of a colorblind equality and merit-based decision-making is again articulated by one of their greatest civil rights leaders, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr,” Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater), the other lead author of the proposed amendment, said at a hearing in the Senate Licensing, Regulatory Reform, State and Federal Affairs Committee on Jan. 7. “Using immutable characteristics like race, sex, color, ethnicity, national origin and the like to discriminate against or grant any individual or group is wrong, no matter who it targets or what the reason, it creates distrust and injust division and represents resentments that divide people instead of uniting them. Past discrimination, however wrong, cannot be corrected with more discrimination.” 
Nass said the amendment would ensure people are hired, promoted, selected and admitted to school in the “same way we choose people for our Olympic team.” 
Drake said the lawmakers who are citing MLK misunderstand his legacy. 
“The reality is that he was someone that was a pioneer in his time and he wasn’t liked because he actually challenged and named the systematic structures that cause disparities throughout this country,” Drake said. “He actively called out his fellow white faith leaders on why they were silent in the face of injustice. He never advocated for a so-called colorblind society. What he was advocating for was that people have access to opportunity.”
GOAT report identifies recommendations to eliminate DEI
The goals of the amendment — and the broader desire to eliminate DEI — were on display during an informational hearing in the Assembly Government Operations, Accountability and Transparency (GOAT) committee on a recent report compiled by Rep. Shae Sortwell.

The Republican from Two Rivers used his authority on the GOAT committee, which was created to be the state’s version of the federal Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), in February 2025 to begin investigating DEI practices in local government. He submitted open records requests to Wisconsin’s 72 counties, the 50 largest municipalities throughout the state and all school districts.
The resulting report released on Jan. 9 was more than 80 pages long. Sortwell also listed thousands of pages of records from counties and municipalities on his website. 
During a Jan. 15 hearing on the report, Sortwell told the GOAT committee that he wanted it to be a “fact-finding” mission. The Wisconsin Counties Association helped guide counties in responding to the requests.
“This is what we found so that you can draw your own conclusions as to what you think,” Sortwell said.
Four counties Buffalo, Richland, Sawyer and Waupaca didn’t have relevant records to share. 
Pierce County did not provide any records to the committee and was identified as uncooperative, according to the report. Sortwell noted during the hearing that Pierce is small and it is possible that is the reason they didn’t reply. 
The following municipalities reported that they had no records: Ashwaubenon, Brookfield, Caledonia, Fond du Lac, Fox Crossing, Germantown, Howard, Marshfield, Menasha, Menominee Falls, Mequon, Mount Pleasant, New Berlin, Oak Creek, Oconomowoc, Pleasant Prairie, West Bend and Wisconsin Rapids. Janesville and Sheboygan failed to provide records to the committee. 
Sortwell discussed spending that some counties, including Rock, Milwaukee and Waukesha, did on DEI training and a “disproportionality” conference hosted by the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) in 2024.
He also highlighted the report’s finding that the Manitowoc mayor attended 24 DEI-related trainings between 2021 and 2023 for a cost of $4,000.
“I’m trying to understand what he didn’t get in the first 23… Is he so racist and homophobic or something that you couldn’t manage to figure out not to treat people badly because they’re different from him in the first 23?” Sortwell said. “Where’s the controls here?”
The report listed a number of recommendations for potential bills lawmakers could pass including one to remove DEI language from state grants, to “prohibit all levels of government from contracting with vendors within a discriminatory DEI lens,” to remove the term “health equity” from all state laws and administrative codes, to prohibit policies and practices relating to equity, prohibit the hiring of DEI staff and use of DEI terminology throughout government, the use of funds for DEI trainings and the requirement that employees participate in such trainings and to prohibit DPI from requiring that school districts “adhere to discriminatory and race-based policies and practices, including spending local tax dollars to fund such.”
Sortwell said he thought the constitutional amendment would take care of some of the recommendations, but that other measures could be needed.
Chair of the committee Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) said at the hearing that she thought the report “presents a lot of high-level evidence, probably just scratching the surface really, for why we need this constitutional amendment.”
Sortwell said the recommendations included in the report were based on his judgment.
Democratic lawmakers on the committee, however, spoke to the value of DEI work and questioned the framing and findings of the report.
Rep. Angelina Cruz (D-Racine) told the Wisconsin Examiner that the report includes “gross mischaracterizations” of DEI and “reflects a deep misunderstanding of what DEI is,” and said she would frame the report as more of a “witch hunt” than an investigation.
Cruz said she thought the process of compiling the report was not transparent. She noted that Sortwell’s work on the report was not discussed with Democratic members of the committee before he started and that lawmakers did not have much time to review the thousands of pages before the hearing. 
“If you want to talk about waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer money, it is to waste public servants’ time and our taxpayer resources on generating the data that produce these conclusions that are not grounded in good research methodology,” Cruz said. 
Rep. Mike Bare (D-Verona), the ranking member of the committee, told Nedweski during the hearing that he found her comment troubling.
“I don’t want to make a partisan game here, but I think there’s one side who sees these as not valuable and one side that does see them as valuable,” Bare said. 
The report noted that local health departments have prioritized “health equity” — noting that the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) includes in its rules that local health departments work to help create it. The report called “health equity” a “phantom DEI term.” 
Republicans and Democrats then engaged in a back and forth about the meaning of the term health equity.
“I don’t think we should be treating people differently because they check some box… that’s equality and I support that, and equity says I want a certain outcome, so I’m going to rig the system,” Sortwell said. 
“I don’t think you have to rig the system — and I don’t think a lot of the things that you’ve pointed out are about rigging the system — services for moms or children support services,” Bare said. “We’re trying to allow for an outcome to be possible… You’ve got 50,000 pages. You didn’t do any analysis to tell us why this is bad. There is a lot more that goes into [the question] should we have health equity or not beyond ideology.”

(Keila Szpaller / Daily Montanan)Montana has a simple rule: If you say you support something, you vote for it. Crazy, right? Unless you’re talking about passenger rail—and a certain U.S. Senator in Washington.
In 2021, Congress passed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Big deal. Big money. Big opportunity. Buried inside: Funding to study and restore long-distance passenger rail through Montana. Hi-Line upgrades. Maybe even the North Coast Hiawatha back on the tracks. Communities were thrilled.
Then came the vote.
Cue the record scratch.
One Montana senator spent months praising passenger rail. Co-sponsored efforts. Made speeches. Smiled for the cameras. And then…voted no.
So here’s the question, Sen. Steve Daines: Why talk a big game about rail—and then vote against the one bill that made it real? I’d ask you in person, but you stopped answering letters years ago and refuse town halls. So we’re asking in public.
Passenger rail isn’t a luxury. It’s infrastructure. It connects small towns to jobs, schools, hospitals, and the rest of the country. Supports tourism. Supports small businesses. Supports seniors who shouldn’t have to drive five hours to see a doctor.
Montana asked for trains. Daines shrugged and voted no.
The 2021 infrastructure law did three things Montanans had begged for:

First serious federal study in decades on restoring long-distance routes.
Funding for Empire Builder planning and upgrades.
A path to bring back routes that once tied Montana together.

The law passed. The study was completed. Communities are acting on it. But somehow, the senator who “supports rail” voted against all of it.
Passenger rail in Montana isn’t just about trains—it’s about cash in local tills, jobs in construction and tourism, and towns that don’t vanish from the map when everyone drives past. It saves Montanans from endless highway marathons, keeps seniors and students from being stranded, and connects small towns to hospitals, schools, and jobs. Tourists can hit Glacier and Yellowstone without a car, spreading the love (and their spending) statewide. It’s safer than our icy highways, cleaner than another gas-guzzling road trip, and—here’s the kicker—actually makes communities stronger. More travel options, more visitors, more money, fewer accidents, less pollution, and towns that thrive instead of survive. All aboard, Montana—if only someone would vote yes.
Montanans get it:

“He supports rail… in press releases only.”
“Say yes in Montana, votes no in Washington.”
“He wants the credit without paying for the tracks.”
“If double-talk ran on rails, it would never be late.”

It’s like saying you love firefighters but voting against the fire department’s water supply. That’s fiscal responsibility, Daines-style.
Bottom line: The infrastructure law wasn’t perfect. No big bill ever is. But for Montana, it finally cracked open the door to long-distance passenger rail. That door exists today because Congress passed the bill. Without it? Still shut. Towns left out in the cold.
Sen. Daines, Montanans want an answer: If you really support rail, why did you vote against the only bill that delivered it?

At issue is a 238-page proposal from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services seeking to cap the number of hours for which live-in, often-family caregivers can be reimbursed under Medicaid for providing in-home care such as to Caster or others. The proposal would also place an annual cost limit on reimbursable care based on a DHHS estimate of nursing home costs statewide.

Caster, other waiver recipients, caregivers and advocates for the elderly and people with disabilities have been among many rallying at the Nebraska State Capitol and urging lawmakers to support them.
“If we get a drop in our quality of care, I know for a fact I would be dead,” Caster said at a Capitol rally last week.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen supports the proposed DHHS caps and included a DHHS-estimated $14.12 million cut to the Medicaid waiver program in his proposed state budget cuts.
In total, the Pillen budget proposal would cut DHHS’s budget by $152 million. The changes to the “Aged and Disabled Waiver” are among the largest health-related cuts. Lawmakers must balance the budget by late March as they face a projected $471 million state shortfall.
Caster said the current in-home care he receives from his parents, Tammy and Darin, is “exceptional,” in part because they understand his needs and how best to care for his condition, which causes muscles to get weaker over time.

If those changes result in him having to constantly teach strangers his care routines, including the likelihood of staffing turnover, Caster said, could cause his level of care to “slip detrimentally into a deadly direction.”
“A long, quality life is the right of every disabled Nebraskan,” Caster said.
Caster said if DHHS, Pillen and state lawmakers spent one or two days in his shoes, or those of his parents, they would understand why having a say in how people are cared for matters, including in-home care.
Balancing the budget
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, a previous chair of the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, was among a handful of lawmakers who attended the rally. He said it was good to hear from people who are concerned, and he isn’t surprised.
“With uncertainty comes fear, and that’s what this kind of created,” Hansen told the Examiner.
Hansen, a registered Republican, the same as Pillen, said he has priorities about how to spend taxpayer money. Among Hansen’s highest priorities is helping to take care of people who can’t take care of themselves or of people whose families and churches can’t help alone.

The Blair senator said there are many other places to cut to balance the budget, which he said should occur first and not on the “backs” of waiver recipients, families and caregivers.
“These are the people that I want to prioritize above all else first,” Hansen said. “To see us deprioritize them really concerns me.”
State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, another Republican in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, also attended, as did Democratic State Sens. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln and Margo Juarez of Omaha. 
Wordekemper said the state needs to look at the Medicaid waivers and how they’re evaluated to better support individuals. 
He said families save the state money by caring for loved ones at home.
“I understand we have to be fiscally responsible, but, at the same point, we have to be realistic and try to do no harm,” said Wordekemper.



Proposed waiver changes

Maximum reimbursable caregiver hours, reduced from 112 hours to 70 hours.

No more than 40 hours could be paid to an in-home family caregiver.
An additional 30 hours could be added, but would need to be delivered by someone outside the home.


Maximum reimbursable costs each year are based on yearly nursing home costs, which were $92,438 as calculated by DHHS.

Families would need to undergo an administrative review when costs reach 150% of the annual cost ($138,657).
Families could be paid as much as 175% of the cost of nursing home care if they pass a clinical review from a DHHS team ($161,767).

‘Doing nothing wasn’t on the table’
The changes come as part of a five-year renewal period for Nebraska’s Aged and Disabled Waiver, which is set to expire July 31. Tony Green, director of the DHHS Division of Developmental Disabilities, said the goal of the changes is “stabilizing” the program and ensuring sustainability.
By mid-2025, the waiver had reached annual costs of $383.6 million, compared to $91 million in mid-2016. That’s an average annual increase of about $29.3 million.

Absent changes, Green said DHHS might have to implement a waiting list, limiting how quickly some families could access the waiver.
“The option of looking at that data and seeing those costs continue to rise at such a drastic rate, the option of doing nothing wasn’t on the table,” Green said in a one-on-one interview.
Pillen and his state budget administrator, Neil Sullivan, have also argued the costs have risen too much. Pillen said the state was “paying grandmas to be grandmas,” while Sullivan had said the state was paying “four times the cost of nursing homes so one person can stay home.” 
Either situation would likely be an outlier, according to DHHS’s own data, with neither Pillen nor Sullivan describing the care individuals in those circumstances would have been receiving. Of about 10,000 waiver recipients, 255 of them had received reimbursable care above $162,000.

The DHHS proposal would also limit families to up to 40 hours of in-home care, down from a current cap of 112 hours. Up to an additional 30 hours could be allowed, but those hours would need to be covered by someone from outside the home, such as from a private provider. 
DHHS is reviewing public comments
Advocates say they rely on the reimbursable hours so they can provide needed 24/7 care at home care without having to also juggle a job, or two, outside the home. Most of the reimbursements are minimum wage, now $15 an hour.
Outside care providers might pay workers $30 to $45 an hour, advocates said last week, leaving some to question whether the DHHS plan would actually save money.
Advocacy organizations and waiver recipients also criticize the DHHS estimate for nursing level of care as a general level and not the heightened care that many individuals on the Aged and Disabled Waiver might need. DHHS estimated the cap this fiscal year as nearly $162,000, which advocates criticized as locking out care at nursing facilities that might charge $1,000 each day.


Aged and Disabled Waiver eligibility

Be eligible for Nebraska Medicaid.
Have a disability or be over the age of 65.
Meet Nursing Facility Level of Care.
Demonstrate need for services.

More information is available here.


In response to questions from the Examiner, Green noted that provider capacity in more traditional facilities is always being worked on and that direct care workforce shortages are “real.” He said DHHS continues to try to be creative with providers to meet needs.
Green said his division is reviewing “well over” 300 comments received on the proposal. Under state law, he said, the state must categorize the responses and address whether changes would be made.
“We are evaluating each and every one of those [comments] in all sincerity,” Green said.
Green said the “drop-dead deadline” to submit the state’s waiver to the federal government for renewal is around March 1. He said that leaves a “little room” in which DHHS could make changes and allow another 30-day public comment period.
Many families say they’re hoping that happens, though they note time is ticking.
“This is not about decreasing services or decreasing any quality in care,” Green said. “It’s really about making sure that the hours that we do authorize into a family’s home are based on need and that we have enough resources to go around for everybody so that the program continues to be sustainable.”
‘Restrain massive cuts’
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha introduced Legislative Bill 958 this year. It would require DHHS to “collaborate” with the Legislature around Medicaid waivers for Home and Community Based Services.

If passed, DHHS would need legislative approval to request a waiver that would introduce an individual cost limit, reduce service hours or narrow eligibility. The bill also would define “nursing facility level of care” as care for which a Medicaid recipient requires assistance with two or more activities of daily living, regardless of the cost.
“It is to restrain massive cuts to developmental disabilities and to ensure that we as a state are doing our utmost to protect this vulnerable population and ensure that they are able to live the full lives that we want them to, and, to the best of their ability, to do it at home when possible,” Cavanaugh said of her bill.
Cavanaugh, a former HHS Committee member who now sits on the Legislature’s budget-writing Appropriations Committee, said she understands some of the waiver changes stemmed from a state audit that found some fraudulently paid DHHS claims.
However, she argued that “sweeping” changes aren’t needed after “a failure of the system to catch errors.” She said investment and training in DHHS would be a better solution.
‘Not just numbers on a page’
Susan Samuelson, “Nana” to her grandson Hunter, who also has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, helped organize and spoke at last week’s rally. She said the proposal would lead many families to consider institutionalization, contrary to U.S. Supreme Court case law and federal law requiring states to provide services so people can live in the “most integrated setting appropriate.”

Samuelson said private providers are “critical,” but when loved ones are stepping up to provide care, that’s not a “luxury” but a “lifeline.” Samuelson also helps lead the new organization “Nebraska Rare,” which focuses on empowering families affected by rare diseases.
“These proposed Medicaid changes are not just numbers on a page,” Samuelson said last week. “They represent real people … real families and real lives.”
She said it’s not trimming the budget but trimming the safety, dignity and independence of some of Nebraska’s most vulnerable neighbors.
Richard Troia, president of Special Sitters, a licensed home health agency serving Omaha and surrounding areas, said he worries about a “domino effect” in which fewer reimbursable hours mean fewer caregivers and fewer options for families, leading to weakened families and increased institutionalization.
Samuelson said families and advocates can’t accept the changes and won’t stop fighting. She described the changes as “a bigger deal than just our disability community.”
“This affects everybody in the state, and we should all have humanity as our No. 1 objective for those who generally cannot advocate for themselves,” Samuelson said.
Hansen said his message to concerned Nebraskans is, “I’m on their side.”
“I’m going to fight for it,” Hansen said. “I’m going to find one way or the other to help make sure that we don’t get this cut.”

Rural areas saw a 16.6% increase in people experiencing homelessness between 2023 and 2025, according to Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority data. During that same time period, urban areas saw a 9.4% increase. 
Those figures don’t tell the full story – “homelessness in rural areas is more complex and often harder to see,” said Brandi Pirtle, housing director for Jeffersonville-based New Hope Services.
Brandi Pirtle, housing director for Jeffersonville-based New Hope Services.
Existing data on homelessness is gathered via point-in-time surveys. These surveys are conducted annually over a one-day period, typically in January or February, and it seldom provides a complete picture.
For example – in IHCDA Region 13, building codes vary across seven counties. Region 13 covers Orange, Washington, Scott, Jefferson, Crawford, Floyd and Clark counties and what’s considered uninhabitable in one county may not be considered such elsewhere, meaning individuals may not show in a PIT count, but they’re in unsafe conditions. Rural homelessness, Pirtle noted is “frequently undercounted,” because it doesn’t neatly fit Housing and Urban Development categories.
Another reason PIT data doesn’t provide a complete picture is that it only covers one day. Pirtle said many families are “doubled-up” – they share a living space but it isn’t permanent or stable. Those families get missed by PIT counts.
“You don’t find the couch surfers, folks that are hidden in the woods or that pop in and out of a friend’s home,” via PIT counts, Jason Hayes, executive director of the men’s residence center at the Evansville Rescue Mission, said.
Pam Brookshire, vice president of community services at northeastern Indiana-based Brightpoint Services, discussed a situation she knew of — a family inherited a home. They’ve had financial and some criminal issues. They owe $2,500 in electricity bills. They’re also over the Energy Assistance Program income guidelines, “and in this county, there are very few resources – nobody can touch that bill. Nobody has the kind of money just to touch that bill.” 
If it isn’t paid, “they are going to be homeless,” she said. To Brookshire, this illustrates the rural homelessness situation.
 “Families make decisions,” she said, “we’ve all made decisions we wish we could take back but they’re in a situation now where they’re going to lose,” their home.
“This is affordable housing for them,” she emphasized. “If they lose this – they can’t find anything comparable that they will be able to afford. There’s nothing out there. It’s those kinds of situations that more rural families face and, because of the lack of resources, it’s everybody trying to pull together instead of one or two agencies that could resolve this situation. They’re not as visible because they’re not that wandering the street homeless.”
Homeless advocates oppose Indiana bill to criminalize sidewalk camping

 The COVID-19 pandemic ultimately made housing in rural areas worse. Brookshire said she was hopeful the “perfect storm” of factors would ease after COVID but “none of that has happened.” A two-bedroom apartment in the Fort Wayne area ranges between $1,300 and $1,500 a month. Senior citizens who used to be able to get by in a one-bedroom apartment with social security can’t afford their homes as rent increases.
New developments and increasing property values are also factors – Pirtle said she’s seen situations where property taxes increased and priced people out of homes they’d lived in for years. 
“That kind of displacement can happen quickly in small, rural communities,” she said.
Development itself can prove challenging depending on local codes, zoning, land availability, local government and infrastructure. Funding exists for rural development, but programs like low-income housing tax credits and others, are competitive and there are concerns about federal-level reductions or eliminations.

 When contacted with questions regarding information in the 2025 State of Homelessness presentation, the IHCDA provided the following:

“IHCDA believes that a portion of the increase in homelessness in rural counties could be attributed to efforts to ensure a more comprehensive and accurate count.The annual Point-In-Time count does not provide us with the data needed to know exactly why there is an increase in individuals experiencing homelessness in rural areas. Many shelter and housing providers remain at or near capacity and as the number of individuals experiencing homelessness continues to rise, a disproportionate percentage of that increase will more than likely be for unsheltered individuals as a result.”
The IHCDA added that in 2023, the Indiana Balance of State Continuum of Care secured funding for three three-year projects addressing rural homelessness. 
The IHCDA is responsible for two initiatives in Jackson and Starke counties. According to the IHCDA “one goal of these projects is to identify and evaluate effective strategies for reducing homelessness in rural communities. By implementing and monitoring target interventions, these programs aim to establish best practices that can be adapted throughout similar rural areas.” 
Pirtle said Hoosiers need to use the expertise that already exists within their own communities to strengthen housing stability “rather than waiting for or relying solely on state or federal intervention.
She emphasized the importance of a local approach to addressing homelessness — “hope alone is not a plan; however action, collaboration and local ownership are,” she said.

This story was originally reported by Candice Norwood of The 19th.  Meet Candice and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
A mother shoved to the ground in front of her children in the hallways of a immigration courthouse in New York. A young woman pulled from her car and handcuffed on a busy street in Key Largo, Florida. A child care worker dragged out of her workplace in Chicago, in front of parents and children. A pregnant woman yanked by one arm through the snowy streets of Minneapolis.
In each of these cases, the aggressors were men working for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and their actions were caught on video widely shared online.
Then came Renee Nicole Good.
On Jan. 7, the 37-year-old mother of three and her wife had dropped off their 6-year-old son at school and were blocks away from home when they stopped by an ICE protest to “support their neighbors,” according to Good’s wife, Becca. People had gathered to blow whistles and shout to alert nearby residents about ICE’s presence in Minneapolis’ Central neighborhood.
Video taken at the scene from different angles and analyzed by multiple news outlets shows Good trying to leave as an ICE agent grasps at the driver-side door handle of her car. A second agent, later identified as Jonathan Ross, was standing toward the front of the car. He fired at least three shots aimed at Good as she attempted to drive away. An agent can be heard saying in one of the videos, “Fucking bitch” after the shots were fired.
Good was killed.
President Trump and Vice President JD Vance have, without evidence, accused Good of attacking Ross and justified his actions as self-defense.
There is no database tracking when ICE agents use force against women. But a growing number of videos captured throughout the first year of the second Trump administration offer some insight into the violent encounters that women have experienced: broken car windows, yanking, shoving, pepper-spraying and shootings, all of them out in the open and available on social media.
ICE agents’ history of violence against men, women and transgender people in detention facilities has been documented. Gender-based violence researchers told The 19th that the widespread visibility of physical violence against women in public spaces does not happen in a vacuum and goes hand-in-hand with the policies and messaging coming from the administration.
The visible attacks shared online come on the heels of President Donald Trump insulting women reporters as “piggy” and “ugly” and downplaying the severity of domestic violence. They also come at a time when reproductive rights and access to gender-affirming care have been significantly restricted, and as funding for gender-based violence services and research centering women and LGBTQ+ people has been stripped.
“All of these things converge to entrap women and make more violence in their lives and have fewer ways for them to escape the violence,” said Dr. Carolyn West, a professor of psychology at the University of Washington Tacoma. “So, it’s not just the violence in your home, it’s the violence in your workplace, it’s the violence in the larger community. It’s state-sponsored violence; all of these things converging together.”
“State-sponsored violence,” as West refers to it, is a term used by researchers to discuss violence perpetrated by government authorities, including local and federal police and ICE agents.
Between 1999 and 2015, the percentage of women who made up the population of people experiencing police use of force increased from 13 percent to 25 percent according to an analysis by the nonprofit think tank Prison Policy Initiative. A study published in the journal for the National Academy of Sciences, based on data from 2013 to 2018, found that Indigenous women and girls experienced a lifetime risk of 4 per 100,000 potentially being killed by police, while the rate for Black women and girls ranged from 2.4 to 5.4 per 100,000; the rate for White women and girls was 2 deaths per 100,000. A 2022 survey of LGBTQ+ people found that 25 percent said they were verbally assaulted during their most recent encounter with police, 13.4 percent said they were sexually harassed and 12.8 percent said they were physically assaulted.
Data tracking use of force by members of law enforcement is underreported and not standardized across the thousands of law enforcement agencies throughout the country, so what is available does not fully reflect the scope of the issue.
For example, the most recent data from government sources, news and academic analysis do not capture specific rates of force among immigration officials against women. One report, by the American Immigration Council, indicates that ICE encounters and arrests with women increased from the end of the Obama administration through the beginning of Trump’s first term. Scenes of Latinas on the receiving end of violence by ICE agents are more common among recent online videos, in part because about half of all immigrants in the United States are from Latin America.
This dearth of more complete data is more apparent in the current Trump administration, researchers said. Over the course of the last year, executive orders on gender and diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility banned the use of certain words. As a result, federal departments and some advocacy groups that cater to marginalized populations removed these words from information in their grant applications and on their websites.
“I’m writing something now and I’ve got seven configurations of the word gender that can’t be used in a grant application,” said Dr. Earl Smith, a professor of women and gender studies at the University of Delaware.
West stated that the lagging research and support for data create a vicious cycle: without updated data, it becomes impossible to show there is a problem, she said.
“It’s almost like a willful ignorance,” West said. “If we can not collect the data, if we defund all these programs, and if nobody’s counting, then there’s the gaslighting that says, ‘Well, there’s no data to say there’s a problem.’”
This has been part of the challenge when speaking about violence by ICE agents since the start of the second Trump administration, researchers said. Without comprehensive tracking, it is difficult to demonstrate a pattern of behavior and its effects. Still, as immigration enforcement escalates to unprecedented levels during the second Trump administration, unbothered by objections and court challenges by state and city leaders, the increasing presence of online videos depicting violent ICE encounters with women has caught public attention, fueling outrage and protest that, at times, has led to more violence.
Six days after the fatal shooting of Good, a video shared and liked by thousands on the social media site Bluesky shows ICE agents in Minneapolis breaking the car window, cutting the seatbelt and forcibly removing a woman of color from her car as she screams, “I’m disabled.”
In another video, a woman can be heard saying “shame on you” to an ICE agent in Minneapolis. In response, the officer says, “Have you all not learned from the past couple of days?” presumably referring to Good’s killing. He then appears to grab the woman’s phone out of her hand.
Reflecting on this dynamic, Hillary Potter, an associate professor of Women and Gender Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, said, “I wonder how much of that culture of machismo, toxic masculinity, whatever you want to call it, is impacting how ICE agents are treating women in the field.”
Potter and other researchers agreed that violence against Black, Brown and LGBTQ+ women has been normalized for years. Good was a White queer woman who was killed while participating in a neighborhood protest to show solidarity with immigrant communities. In Minneapolis, Latinos, Somalis and Hmong people have been the main targets of ICE enforcement actions.
“This is new to the current generation of folks looking in,” Smith said. “But Black folks for sure, Somalis, for sure, Hmong people in Minneapolis — they know the deal. They’ve been abused for years.”
Trump, meanwhile, has called Good “very violent” and “very radical,” and said she was “very, very disrespectful to law enforcement” before she was shot dead. It is a similar kind of language he has used to vilify immigrants of color and justify his administration’s pursuit.
“We’ve seen countless numbers of marginalized women, transgender women, who have been brutalized by law enforcement,” West said. “So it’s really interesting to me at this time that White people are seeing that they’re not going to be protected either. Your Whiteness and your femaleness is not going to protect you, not from these systems.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_1499-scaled-e1768908616995-1024x684.jpg,,,2026-01-20 06:57:38.196710

The Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry’s Local Food for Schools Program, which launched last year, connects local agricultural producers and farms with school cafeterias.
Brady Womack, rural economic development coordinator for the Department of Agriculture and approver for the program, said one of the program’s goals is educating students about the culinary “farm-to-table or farm-to-school” movement, which emphasizes the importance of using locally sourced ingredients and supporting local economies.
Oklahoma’s program is modeled after a larger one managed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which the state participated in from 2022 through 2025. 
Oklahoma’s Legislature allocated $3.2 million for the program, which allows approved schools to use state funding to purchase minimally processed foods such as fruits, vegetables, eggs, meat, dairy products, and nuts. 
Minimally processed refers to foods that haven’t been altered in a way that significantly changes the fundamental properties, Womack said. He said his agency works directly with its Food Safety Division to choose which farmers and ranchers are approved and to ensure they have completed all requirements to be able to sell food to schools or the public, Womack said. 
“The Food Safety makes sure they have all their verifications or classes taken to be able to sell food to schools or the public,” Womack said.  
The program allows schools to request a maximum of $25,000 per month in increments of $5,000, with a limit of $100,000 per fiscal year. After the initial allocation, schools can then only apply once monthly.  
Meriruth Sellers, director of market development for the state Department of Agriculture,  said schools can choose which farms or ranches to purchase from as long as they follow the program’s requirements. 
“Many schools are able to buy from nearby farms, while others may have to travel farther,” she said.
The program reimburses schools for purchases of local food so it only saves them the exact dollar that they purchased, Sellers said. 
“This program is not intended to cover entire food costs … it is intended to help schools build relationships with local farmers by offsetting the cost of food,” she said.
To meet higher consumer demand resulting from utilization of the new program, some producers have had to adjust their production rate but most have been able to maintain their normal daily operations, according to the American Farmers and Rancher’s Cooperative. 
Katie Whitfield, a field representative and coordinator with the Oklahoma Certified Beef Association, said that the program has a significant positive impact on the Oklahoma farmers and ranchers who participate. 
“It provides them with stable, consistent buyers who purchase substantial quantities of their products, helping to create financial security while also allowing them to support their local schools and communities,” she said.
Whitfield said the biggest challenge is logistics — getting the product to the schools efficiently. Some districts require large quantities of beef, which can pose transportation or delivery challenges, but these are manageable as the program continues to grow, and infrastructure improves.”
“Programs like this shorten the supply chain, making the food system more resilient, transparent, and sustainable,” Whitfield said. “They keep food dollars circulating within the state, support local economies, and reduce dependence on out-of-state suppliers—all while giving students access to fresh, nutritious, locally produced food.”
She said her organization views Oklahoma’s Food for Schools Program as becoming an essential part of the state’s food supply chain.
“As more schools participate and more producers get involved, we anticipate expanded product offerings, stronger local supply networks, and deeper partnerships between agriculture and education,” Whitfield said. “Ultimately, the goal is for locally sourced food to become the norm in Oklahoma school cafeterias.”

Buttigieg was following in the footsteps of other Democrats who have visited Wisconsin’s closely divided 3rd Congressional District to needle Republican U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden for failing to meet publicly with his constituents who are bearing the brunt of tariffs, high prices and unaffordable health care spurred by Trump administration policies Van Orden has supported. 
In making his La Crosse appearance to bolster a Democratic candidate in a swing district ahead of the midterms — and perhaps to stick his toe in the water ahead of a potential 2028 presidential run — Buttigieg connected with rural and blue-collar Midwestern voters.That’s something Democrats arguably need to do better if they are going to overcome total domination by the party of President Donald Trump. 
The most interesting thing about the La Crosse town hall was the energized audience of rural and small-town Wisconsin and Minnesota residents worried about the the scary, violent authoritarian regime that is rapidly consolidating its power over a stunned and fractured citizenry.

Brad Pfaff, who took the stage ahead of Buttigieg, praised him as “a son of the Midwest,” denounced President Donald Trump’s gilded White House ballroom, and declared, “The rich get tax breaks and what do the rest of us get? Rising costs!” Pfaff also took a jab at “tech bros” who got front-row seats at Trump’s inauguration and are profiting from algorithms that sow “hate and distrust and division.” 
Buttigieg picked up on that theme, urging people to reach out in person to connect with their neighbors who might disagree with them. Responding to a veteran in the audience who said he was in despair about talking to people who live in a pro-Trump social media bubble and who “don’t know how close to the abyss we really are,” Buttigeig said, ”This is where I believe in the power of the offline.” 
“We are increasingly sorted into these silos where not just our opinions, but our facts, or would-be facts, are presented to us. But our relationships, our families, our neighborhoods, our communities, our churches, our little league, our sports loyalty, right? That’s where we have a chance to get through to people.”

Rebecca Cooke, who lost her challenge to Van Orden in 2024 by three percentage points and is seeking a rematch, used her few minutes on stage ahead of Buttigieg to emphasize her dairy farm upbringing and work experience as a waitress, declaring, “I’m a working-class Wisconsinite who hopes to be your next member of Congress.” Cooke touted “right to repair,” legislation, “so every time your John Deere breaks down you don’t have to go to the dealership.” Her parents, she said, were on their annual trip to Mexico to get their dental work done for an affordable price “which is ridiculous.” She described how her dad was hit with a bill for over $1,000 at Walgreen’s when he went to fill a prescription for cancer medication. She’s running, she said, to represent people who “just want to be able to put gas in the car and have a little money left over.”
Going beyond Democrats’ ubiquitous talking points about “affordability,” audience members brought up their spiritual beliefs, the meaning of democracy, how technological change is driving a growing sense of alienation, the need to reconnect with neighbors and overcome political divisions, and the horror of seeing federal agents gun down a woman in a residential neighborhood in Minneapolis.
A young woman who lives near Minneapolis broke down crying as she asked Buttigieg, “How do we deal with this attack on our community, on people that we love?”
“The only antidote to a politics of fear is a politics of courage,” Buttigieg told her, praising her compassion and her desire to work for change. “It seems like you’re alone in caring,” he added, but “the majority of Americans think what’s going on there is wrong.” He had just come from talking to farmers in a conservative area of the state, he said, who were very worried about the impact of immigration enforcement on their workers. “We can bring together strange bedfellows,” he said, “as they’re doing everything they can to pull us apart.” 
A Vietnam veteran, part of a large contingent of vets who stood to accept applause as Buttigieg acknowledged them and thanked them for their service, held up a copy of the U.S. Constitution and said he was upset by Trump’s “abuse” of the military and the National Guard. “I’m really worried that a lot of our people are going to look at our veterans, look at the National Guard — and I’ve got that same creepy feeling that we used to have when we came back before — we’re not going to get the respect for what we really are.”
“Thank you for reminding us of your experience, and I know that was an experience for, really, a generation of service members,” Buttigieg said. When he finished his tour of duty in Afghanistan, he added, “I was fortunate to belong to a generation of veterans who came home to a pretty good welcome, because our country learned the hard way how to separate its attitudes about a policy from its attitudes about the people who were sent somewhere by that policy.”
He connected that change in attitude to a general capacity Americans have for learning from their mistakes, “We learned, we grew. That’s the best thing about this country,” he said. Current efforts to whitewash U.S. history assume that “any time you talk about the things that were wrong about America, that must mean you hate America,” he said, but “some of the finest moments that brought out the greatest character of this country is how we put it right.”
There’s a long way to go before we put things right in our country now, just one year into what already appears to be the most destructive administration in U.S. history. But the feeling in the room at the town hall in La Crosse was hopeful that a new, majoritarian politics could shake off the divisiveness and fear of the Trump era and reclaim democracy and a government by and for the people.
As third-generation dairy farmer Sabrina Servais put it, describing the loss of half of dairy farms in Wisconsin since the early 2000s and her fierce love for her own family’s small, organic farm, “the most beautiful place on Earth,”  “It’s easy to feel small when you’re so far away in rural America. Will anyone listen? … But we matter. We’re a swing state. We have the power to change the outcome of elections. We are the working class of America. How dare they doubt us? … We believe that, despite everything, the world is still beautiful.”

Parks Elementary in Oklahoma City on the first day of school on Aug. 13, 2025. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma’s legislators are, once again, seeking a silver bullet to solve our complex education problems.
It doesn’t exist, and their annoying habit of trying to take shortcuts to solve complicated, intertwined problems and repeating lobbyists’ popular talking points, continue to undermine teaching and learning. 
No “miracle” is going to quickly fix our sagging literacy rates and restore reading for comprehension or simply increase our testing outcomes. 
It will take a marathon to do that.
Unfortunately that hasn’t dawned on lawmakers yet judging by the fact that they’ve become focused on a new “silverbullet” — the Oklahoma State Chamber’s education plan, called “Oklahoma Competes.” The strategy relies heavily on the assumption that retaining third graders will benefit more students than it harms.
And while there is evidence that retention improves test scores, there is also even more compelling evidence that it increases dropout rates, and that it reduces children’s earnings as adults and stigmatizes youth.
Yet, our legislators and lobbyists constantly praise the “Mississippi Miracle,” which is a policy package policy that laid a foundation for student supports, including remediation services for students, phonics, and teacher training programs, as well as controversial online tutoring. It also focuses on accountability metrics that, I believe, drove down teaching and learning over the last quarter of a century.
Those policies led to boosts in fourth grade performance on the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) tests. The test is often used as a barometer to measure how each state’s education system is performing against its peers. 
But I’m doubtful about the overall success of the program.
Sure, Mississippi fourth grade scores saw a jump in test scores, but if there had been long-term gains in reading comprehension, we would have seen that translate into the 8th grade NAEP scores by now.  
In 2024, research found that Mississippi’s eighth grade reading scores have not changed since 2002, which raises doubts in my mind about the long-term effectiveness of Mississippi’s strategy and if third grade children are actually learning the basics of reading or if they’re teaching to a test.
The other elephant in the room that Oklahoma legislative leaders seem to be avoiding is that Mississippi’s program started with a $100 million grant by the Barksdale Foundation. It was a private investment that had been successfully tested in other schools, which trained teachers in literacy instruction.
What is the chance that Oklahoma would do something like that? 
Yes, the Chamber now supports a number of programs along the lines of the services Mississippi funds. But, why are supporters so quiet about their price tags, and where the money will come from?
I’ll tell you why. It’s going to cost a ton of money to do this right, and spending that money will be a tough sell among our penny-pinching lawmakers. 
At a time when funding is being cut for a range of service providers and nonprofit organizations whose support for public education is often essential, what are the chances that we would fully invest in the more expensive parts of the Mississippi plan?
So, before we discuss retaining students, we should consider starting with win-win, long-term investments in early literacy screenings, intervention specialists, additional instructional time, structured summer programs and targeted support for at-risk students. 
Once we have those in place — and adequately funded — for several years, then we could talk about implementing retention policies.  
Instead of seeking quick fixes that will do little to address underlying problems, we should heed the wisdom of State Superintendent Lindel Fields.
He says instead of a “miracle,” we need a “marathon.”  
Indeed, there is no quick way of reversing our literacy crisis. 
It’s going to take a concentrated, long-term investment in teachers, children, and schools to improve student outcomes. 
Whether we are talking about test-driven accountability for third graders or for teachers, the supports they need, or how to fund these efforts, one thing is abundantly clear.
We need open, balanced discussions, and research on both sides of the issues that includes educators and parents.
Because there is no easy fix to our education system.

Mikie Sherrill, but New Jersey's deficit may force hard choices. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill will face growing budget deficits, shrinking federal support, and a resistance to new tax hikes as she moves to enact her first spending bill in the coming months.
But Sherrill, a Democrat who becomes governor on Tuesday at noon, will enter office with far more resources than her predecessors.
New Jersey’s reserves will remain at some of their highest levels in decades after Gov. Phil Murphy (D) leaves office. And though spending that has already been approved and expiring one-shot revenue sources stand to expand New Jersey’s deficit and shrink its reserves, experts said past treasurers and governors would envy the Sherrill administration’s position.

Rather than having to raise hundreds of millions in new revenue or cut the same amount in spending, Sherrill can decide which of her priorities she wants to pursue first, said David Rousseau, who served as state treasurer under Gov. Jon Corzine.
“Recognizing that the challenges of meeting the spending needs of the state still exist, and the need to look forward, any governor and treasurer since 2001 would love to have this situation,” he said. “This allows a more focused look at the budget, instead of dealing in a crisis situation.”
New Jersey’s current budget calls for state spending to exceed state revenue by $1.5 billion. That deficit is set to grow after non-recurring revenue that has buttressed the budget in the current July-to-June fiscal year runs dry and steep cost increases from the nascent property tax relief program Stay NJ take effect in the fiscal year that begins July 1.
Those include a $550 million transfer from a state fund meant to pay down higher-interest debt to reduce long-term borrowing costs, and the roughly $900 million increase to the annual costs of Stay NJ.
The lost revenue and added costs could speed the draining of New Jersey’s surplus, which was expected to fall to $6.7 billion by the end of June, and leave it less prepared to backfill steep reductions to federal aid, said Peter Chen, senior policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective.
“It makes sense to save up even more money in your rainy-day fund for the rainy day, the bad weather that’s yet to come,” he said. “Dipping into your savings to pay your bills now is only going to hurt you down the road.”
State officials have said federal changes to Medicaid would reduce annual federal funding for the program by about $3.6 billion. Some of those costs are likely to pass through to charity care or hospital emergency rooms, boosting some state expenses.
But with New Jersey’s surplus still near record highs, Sherrill has room to spend some down, a flexibility governors like Chris Christie and Jon Corzine never enjoyed.
“There is this structural deficit, but the discussion is ‘what actions do we have to take to maintain whatever surplus we want?’ It’s not ‘what actions do we have to take to meet our constitutional obligation and have any surplus?’” said Rousseau.
A lack of legislative support for new taxes could complicate Sherrill’s path to her own spending priorities. She’s due to deliver her first budget address in late February or March.
Democrats in Trenton homed in on affordability as a top issue following legislative losses and a narrow gubernatorial win in 2021, and they’ve credited that focus for recent election wins that delivered the party a third consecutive governorship and its broadest Assembly majority in more than half a century.
“I think we need to continue to look at ways and find ways to make New Jersey more affordable,” Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) told reporters last week.
Chen and other progressives have argued the state can boost revenue without politically costly broad-based tax hikes by creating new brackets for higher earners — at $2 million or $5 million in income, say — and for highly profitable businesses.
Reforms to the tax code that don’t alter rates, like changes to capture more business income reported outside the United States, could also boost revenue without straining New Jersey residents writ large. Either way, Chen said, something would have to give.
“The reality of the budget and of maintaining services is going to require more revenue at some point,” Chen said. “Or it will require the kinds of cuts that we’re already seeing in some districts. We’re hearing about layoffs. We’re hearing about cuts.”
New Jersey’s corporate taxes on high-earning businesses are already the highest in the nation, and its marginal rate on top-level individual incomes only lags behind rates in California, Hawaii, and neighboring New York.
Republican lawmakers who have chaffed at the state budget’s growth under Murphy — it rose from about $39 billion in Murphy’s first year to around $59 billion in the current fiscal year — said Sherrill would eventually have to make those tough budget decisions.
“We are going to reach a point where the governor’s going to have to look at the budget in total, and she’s going to have to make some hard decisions, and we’re going to have to decide what the state of New Jersey has to do, what it would like to do, and what it can no longer afford to do,” state Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris), his chamber’s minority leader, told reporters last week.

Project Jade could eventually use the same amount of electricity as produced by 10 nuclear power plants.
The post Laramie County approves construction of what could become the largest data center in US appeared first on WyoFile .","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

Wyoming is poised to become an artificial-intelligence powerhouse after Laramie County commissioners earlier this month unanimously voted to move forward with the construction of a 1.8 gigawatt data center designed to eventually scale up to 10 gigawatts, which would be the largest single AI campus in the U.S. 
The facility will include the Project Jade data center campus built by AI infrastructure company Crusoe and the BFC Power and Cheyenne Power Hub built next door by Tallgrass Energy Partners to provide it with electricity. BFC Power and Cheyenne Power Hub will provide on-site power from natural gas turbines. Matt Field, chief real estate officer for Crusoe, told the Laramie County commissioners during the Jan. 6 hearing that the first phase of the project will leverage natural gas with a potential pathway for CO2 sequestration in the future. 
Crusoe and Tallgrass announced in July that the center’s close proximity to Tallgrass’ existing CO2 sequestration hub will “provide long-term carbon capture solutions” for the gas turbines powering the data center. “Future renewable energy developments” touted by the companies in their joint statement could include solar power to augment the gas turbines in later stages of the project, according to Wyoming Energy Authority.
The companies have yet to announce the specific tech firms to benefit from the Jade data center, but the project is expected to meet the extreme power and infrastructure demands of hyperscale cloud providers and AI industry leaders, said Crusoe spokesperson Andrew Schmitt.
Both of the interconnected projects are now proceeding to the construction phase in the Switch Grass Industrial Park area, located 8 miles south of Cheyenne. With the site plans approved by the county, Crusoe and Tallgrass Energy expect construction to be completed on the first buildings in 2027.
Prior to the final vote, the Hyndman Homesites Homeowners Association, which represents a community adjacent to the project, wrote a letter to the county commissioners requesting that the site plan adhere to certain considerations. The letter details residents’ concerns with deep wells drilled into the aquifer, increased traffic and noise, light pollution, gas turbine emissions, noxious odors and the location of wastewater ponds. Additionally, the letter urged the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to ensure compliance with requirements to minimize the impacts on wildlife migration routes and sensitive habitat inside the project area. 



“We accept the inevitability of the project and want to identify and mitigate concerns before they become problems,” the homeowners’ association wrote.
The AI campus is expected to open with a capacity of 1.8 gigawatts of electricity, over five times more than the roughly 238,000 homes in Wyoming currently use, with the potential to scale up to 10 gigawatts, pending state and county approvals. One gigawatt can power approximately 750,000 to one million average U.S. homes, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. 
The Associated Press reported that electricity needed to power the first phase of the center is predicted to double the entire state of Wyoming’s current energy generation. Compared to a report listing the 15 largest data centers in the world by the information technology provider Brightlio, the Jade Project could set a global record in energy use by a single center if the planned expansion reaches 10 gigawatts. Jones Lang LaSalle’s 2026 Global Data Center Outlook projects total global data center energy capacity to rise from 103 gigawatts to about 200 gigawatts by 2030. 
“Building an American AI factory that can scale to 10 gigawatts of capacity illustrates Crusoe’s commitment to delivering infrastructure at the scale needed for the U.S. to win the global AI race,” Crusoe co-founder and CEO Chase Lochmiller stated in a July press release announcing the project. 
Jumping into the AI race
Wyoming developers and state officials have touted the projected benefits of becoming a hub for AI and high-performance computing, which they say will include job creation, economic diversification, increased tax revenue and demand for natural gas and renewable energy. The project’s construction phase is expected to employ approximately 5,000 workers at its peak, per the site plan. Field said the data center will have approximately 400 permanent jobs, ranging from janitorial positions to engineers. 
“Wyoming is pro-business and pro-growth,” U.S. Sen. John Barrasso said in a press release. “Our commitment to innovation and investment is what makes our state great. New, state-of-the-art data centers like this will bring high-paying jobs and a skilled workforce to southeast Wyoming.”
The state is also looking to nuclear energy to meet the increasing demands of the AI industry. TerraPower, the advanced nuclear reactor company founded by Bill Gates, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced earlier this month that Cheyenne is one of the sites being considered for a dual-unit Natrium power plant that could be completed as soon as 2032 to fuel the Meta AI data center already under construction there. TerraPower is building the world’s first Natrium reactor in Kemmerer.

The proposals for AI are exciting for the state’s fossil fuel industry as well.
In a statement last year when the Jade data center was announced, Gov. Mark Gordon wrote that the news was exciting for “Wyoming and for Wyoming natural gas producers.” Gordon had previously called Wyoming an optimal location for AI expansion, partly due to its energy infrastructure and cooler climate.
Wyoming Energy Authority Executive Director Rob Creager told Inside Climate News that the state needs to keep up with the world’s growing demand for AI. Creager said that the AI platform ChatGPT will eventually become as mainstream as a Google search.
“I’ve heard it as an arms race before,” Creager said. “We can’t lose track of the fact that we’re in a competition with folk in China. It is really crucial to national security that we lead on AI and that we have those technologies.” 
But Johanna Fornberg, a senior researcher at Greenpeace USA, has urged local and state governments to rein in huge AI investments. Legislators should instead focus on what directly benefits people’s lives, such as transitioning to renewable energy, Fornberg said.
“The industry has been using a lot of these big hypothetical promises about the benefits of AI,” Fornberg said. “They’re selling it for health care and curing cancer, accelerating climate action, improving well-being, even in your day-to-day life and in your job. And that’s all sort of a tactic to create demand and support for the data center buildout that’s happening.” 
Fornberg noted that the Crusoe and Tallgrass project, which will use “an unprecedented amount of power in a relatively short amount of time,” is an example of charging ahead without fully investigating the potential risks involved.
“This data center, at 10 gigawatts, is huge,” Fornberg said. “I mean, a large nuclear power plant provides about 1 gigawatt of energy. So, at the top end, we’re talking about the same energy output as 10 big nuclear power plants, which is a lot.”
AI’s opportunities and challenges for Wyoming energy 
Wyoming’s energy resources position the state to capitalize on AI, Creager said. 
“Everybody knows that there is plenty sitting in the ground that can help fuel this,” Creager said, noting that Crusoe’s plan to augment its electricity supply with solar should bring down the demand for gas. “I think it’s doable. I think as we do this … we’ll figure out how to do it more efficiently.”
Some AI data centers, including Microsoft’s facility in Cheyenne, power their servers with a mix of fossil fuels and renewable energy, and learning how to power and manage data centers efficiently is a work in progress, Creager said. 
Neither Crusoe nor Tallgrass made representatives available for comment, but Crusoe’s website stated that the center would source energy from natural gas rigs outfitted with carbon capture and sequestration technology to limit their emissions of climate-warming gases. 
But Fornberg believes using carbon capture and sequestration for data center energy generation is counterproductive.
“Carbon capture is sort of one of these techno solutions that is very energy intensive, expensive and often just increases net emissions and pollution overall,” she said. “Especially when compared to just replacing those energy sources with clean energy sources. It’s a way that we are really providing a longer lifespan for existing fossil fuel infrastructure. And in some cases, even justifying new fossil fuels.”
An August analysis from Goldman Sachs Research forecasts that about 60% of the increasing electricity demands from U.S. data centers will be met by burning fossil fuels, increasing carbon emissions through 2030 by approximately 220 million tons. Those increased emissions could also impact human health, Fornberg added. 
“Part of the nature of working with gas as an energy source is that you have these leaks and in some cases, intentional flares or releases of gas,” Fornberg said. “That is a major climate impact but can also cause well-documented health impacts for the communities that live locally to those gas generation facilities.” 
Crusoe and Tallgrass have yet to state the amount of solar power that will be paired with natural gas or at what stage in the project solar power would be included in the energy mix.
Thirsty technology in a water-stressed state
A single data center’s cooling towers can consume millions of gallons of water annually to prevent the computing infrastructure from overheating, according to Veolia Water Technologies & Solutions, which is particularly problematic for a facility as large as Project Jade in an arid state like Wyoming. 
To reduce that demand, Crusoe announced plans in its 2024 Impact Report to combat significant water loss at its data centers by implementing closed-loop cooling systems that recycle treated water and treatment fluids.
Still, there are always system losses, said Jonathan Brant, a University of Wyoming environmental engineering professor. 
“Even if it’s a quote-unquote closed loop, you’re going to have losses because of the nature of heat exchange,” Brant said. “Those computers generate an incredible amount of heat.”
To remove the most heat from computers, water must transform from a liquid into a vapor, Brant explained, and a portion of that evaporates, much like the billowing clouds that rise from the cooling towers at power plants. How much new freshwater will be needed to replace what evaporates from the cooling system is a critical question, he said. 
“It’s scary when you think about the power and the water that’s going to be consumed by these facilities,” Brant said. “That’s why they keep it secret.”
Many AI centers in Wyoming tap into brackish or alkaline groundwater, as opposed to using freshwater, Brant said, but even if the cooling water is sourced from an aquifer with water of too low quality for other uses, it could potentially impact a connected aquifer with a potable supply, so industry engineers must study how aquifers are connected before tapping into them. And safely disposing of increasingly salty water after it has undergone many cycles of heat exchange also poses a challenge, Brant said. 
“Some say they’re going to reinject it, like they do in the oil and gas field,” Brant said. “That may work. But if that’s not something that can be done, are they just going to use surface impoundments? Evaporation ponds can be an environmental hazard just like they are in the gas sector.”
If wastewater is expelled during the cooling process, it could be contaminated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals. PFAS are used to prevent the corrosion of AI electronics, which would pose other health concerns, Fornberg cautioned. Studies have linked long-term exposure to even low levels of some PFAS, also known as “forever chemicals” for their persistence in the environment, with serious health problems, including cancer and damage to reproductive and immune systems.
A lack of regulation
During the hearing to review the Jade project’s site plan, several Laramie County residents voiced concerns about the lack of water regulations.
The plan states that engineers plan to drill deep wells underneath the shale and sandstone Lance Formation to access industrial water beneath the Ogallala Aquifer’s potable water. But Randy Fox, president of Hyndman Homesites Homeowners Association, questioned whether the geologic survey of the region that will guide the drilling of the wells adequately maps the varying size and depth of the aquifer to protect the drinking-water supply.

“You don’t know until you punch a hole in it what you’re dealing with,” Fox said. “Does the state have the data to support drilling deep wells into the Lance Formation without compromising the Ogallala Formation’s [drinking water] above it?”
Resident Thomas White, who lives near the site of the Jade data center, is also concerned about water contamination. 
“They say that they’re going to drill deeper,” White said. “What happens when they punch a hole and there’s leaks that contaminate the aquifer? How much water will they be taking out of the ground? We have to take that into consideration.”
In November, the Wyoming Outdoor Council released a white paper about data center policy in Wyoming that recommends regulations for permitting, site selection and community assistance. 
Among them: mandating public energy and water use reporting “to allow regulators and communities to assess impacts of data centers and track progress toward efficiency or sustainability goals.” The report pointed to Illinois’ Data Center Energy and Water Reporting Act as a regulatory guide.
Wyoming has yet to establish laws to track the environmental and economic impacts of AI centers, and state legislators are not expected to discuss the growth of the industry during the upcoming budget session in February. 
In December, Greenpeace USA, along with over 230 environmental groups, signed an open letter to Congress demanding a national moratorium on new data-center construction until regulations address environmental and economic concerns. State and local governments, which negotiate deals with data developers, need comprehensive rules, Fornberg said—protecting consumers from utility rate hikes, requiring renewable energy and more.
“There has to be strong regulations in place in order for these companies to do the right thing,” Fornberg said. “I think the issue is not whether or not we should value innovation, it’s how we are valuing innovation.”

Punishing UW, gutting Wyoming Business Council are mistakes by power hungry budget-cutters, columnist Kerry Drake opines.
The post Wyoming lawmakers give young people more reasons to leave appeared first on WyoFile .","When my family moved to Wyoming in 1969, folks told me most young people were destined to leave this rural state. Self-deportation was often chalked up to wanderlust, but many of my friends bolted because of the lack of job opportunities after high school and college.

Opinion

I’ve watched generations of state lawmakers tearfully lament the loss of our “best and brightest” and “our future,” yet they never find ways to stem the tide. Many don’t even try. Our current crop of legislative leaders in Cheyenne — many who came from out of state — seem hell-bent on finding new ways to make Wyoming a less attractive place to live and raise a family.
What other conclusion should we reach after the Joint Appropriations Committee last week turned in a budget that punishes both higher education and efforts to recruit and retain businesses? It was loonier than any Mad Hatter’s tea party.
I can’t imagine that most Wyomingites agree with the committee’s short-sighted goal to cut budgets at all costs. A state can be fiscally conservative without making the kind of reckless, nonsensical moves that’s become our Legislature’s trademark.
There are many reasons to be proud of the University of Wyoming, which has developed a unique culture over the past 140 years as the state’s only public four-year university. But the Legislature’s budget cuts to UW show a pattern of punishing the institution for its failure to conform to lawmakers’ values.
In recent years, some lawmakers have focused on gutting the UW Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, shutting down gender studies programs and ensuring that students can’t get a state-funded abortion. They spent more time debating those issues than funding academic programs.
Last week, the Joint Appropriations Committee gave us a downright chilling preview of UW’s future. Put on a coat and take a look:
The panel slashed $40 million from UW’s block grant without even bothering to make a case for why the drastic cut was necessary. It made $21 million in other cuts to targeted programs, for a total budget reduction of nearly 13%.
Among the casualties: 

Wyoming Public Media, which saw all of its $1.69 million allocation for public radio removed from UW’s block grant.
The athletic department’s $6 million request aimed at  better compensating student athletes for their name, image and likeness, commonly known as NIL, which was made necessary by a landmark NCAA settlement in 2025.

Adding insult to injury, the committee also nixed UW’s request for $12.5 million to obtain matching donations or grants that potentially could have made up some of these losses.
The cuts to Wyoming Public Media and the athletics department are particularly egregious decisions that strike at the heart of what unites the people of Wyoming. Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, a far-right Freedom Caucus member who also brought the $40 million block grant reduction to the committee, made both motions.

Wyoming Public Media ramped up its fundraising efforts to deal with a $500,000 cut after Congress defunded the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. But if it stands, this state cut would result in eight employees losing their jobs and reduce the news reporting and local programs the station provides its statewide audience.
The athletic budget cut has sparked renewed speculation that UW might leave the NCAA’s Division 1 for inferior but less costly competition. UW sports boosters have weathered such calls from within the university and the Legislature for years, but the inability to raise NIL budgets without state assistance could be the tipping point. 
If it happens, UW’s fan base will never recover, and many donors to athletic and academic programs will disappear. Playing colleges in Montana and South Dakota can’t remotely match fans’ excitement when UW is in a football bowl game or national basketball tournament with top-notch competition.
The budget-cutters have already given Wyoming’s young adults more reasons to shun UW and look at universities beyond our borders. What about the Legislature’s failure to deliver on calls for economic diversification and higher-paying jobs?
Sen. Dan Laursen, R-Powell, led the effort to dismantle the Wyoming Business Council, proposing to reassign some of its work to agencies that haven’t even been notified and completely shut down programs like Main Street and the Small Business Investment Credit.
Why? Let’s hear Pendergraft’s explanation.
“The concept, the underlying idea behind this, is to get government out of the way and allow businesses to find their own way and work for themselves, to survive on their own,” Pendergraft said.
I agree that parts of government should get out of the way, specifically legislators who don’t believe that government should have anything to do with how the state can assist businesses and grow the economy by adding jobs and infrastructure that help communities thrive. 
Yes, if businesses somehow do find a reason to come to Wyoming, I guess they can just fend for themselves. Why care if they survive?

Randall Luthi, Gov. Mark Gordon’s policy director and a former GOP speaker of the House, had an appropriate response to the committee’s work: “This is nuts. This is crazy.”
Sen. Ogden Driskill, R-Devils Tower, former Senate president, told his colleagues that if Wyoming wants a tax base it must want businesses to come here.
“We’re doing just the opposite,” Driskill said. “We’ve openly come out and said we’re anti-wind, anti-solar, anti-carbon capture, anti-this, anti-that. Name me, around this table, what you’re for — and how do you want taxes paid in Wyoming?”
When I was a kid, I planned to leave Wyoming as soon as I could. I don’t regret my decision to stay because I grew to love this state. It’s been a good home.
But as a senior, I look at how lawmakers punish the university, push to decimate the Business Council and do virtually nothing to solve monumental problems like lack of access to quality health care and our unaffordable housing statewide, and I can’t honestly say I’d recommend my decision to any young person today.
What I would say to them is, “Will you please stay and run for the Legislature and get these dangerous people out of office before they do more damage?” Because that’s really our best hope.

He says lawmakers failed to heed his myriad recommendations.,"Kevin Walsh investigated public corruption for six years as New Jersey's acting comptroller. He says lawmakers failed to heed his myriad recommendations. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)In almost six years as New Jersey’s acting comptroller, Kevin Walsh has issued more than 100 reports and audits revealing public fraud, waste, and abuse that cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.
In each, he handed lawmakers evidence of corruption and a roadmap for reform, listing recommendations that typically require legislative action. But legislators too often ignored his recommendations and sometimes even acted to undermine his work, Walsh said.
Now, as he prepares to hand off the job to successor Shirley Emehelu — tapped by Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, who takes office Tuesday — Walsh listed that failure as among his biggest takeaways from his time as a state watchdog.
“I’m really struck by how much corruption there is and how much acquiescence there is around it,” Walsh said.
Paid family leave expands to more workers under new law

Among his allegations were that politically connected insurance brokers profited from public health plans and nursing home operators stole public funds through illicit Medicaid schemes. His recommendations on both issues went unheeded, he said.
Nursing home fraud, especially, has been well-documented for years, by his office and others. Yet policymakers enacted only “performative reform” or failed to crack down on it while continuing to give billions in public funds to operators, Walsh said.
“We’ve gone backwards in nursing homes despite the evidence showing the depth of the problem,” he said. “I do know that the Legislature has done things that have made the problem worse, and I do know that they have ignored every single recommendation that I have made in report after report that shows the degree of fraud, waste, and abuse in nursing homes.”
He pointed to a 2021 report, in which his investigators discovered state Treasury officials had a yearslong backlog of hundreds of cases of suspected pension fraud to investigate. Walsh recommended lawmakers give Treasury’s pension fraud and abuse unit subpoena power to compel the compliance of defiant local governments. That’s a bill Assemblyman Erik Peterson (R-Hunterdon) has introduced eight times since 2010, but it has never moved.
“That’s been a big focus of Governor Murphy and of the Legislature — strengthening our pension systems. So why are we tolerating that?” Walsh said. “There’s a backlog of hundreds of people for over a decade who have been flagged as requiring an investigation, but they’re being blocked because they don’t have subpoena power. Why would the Legislature not do something? It’s inexcusable.”
Spokespeople for Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin (D-Middlesex) did not respond to a request for comment.

John Donnadio, executive director of the New Jersey Association of Counties, suspects legislative inaction arose, in part, from concerns about Walsh’s methods. Donnadio said the county officials he represents were frequently frustrated by Walsh’s “salacious” reports and his failure to include in them the full responses of his targets.
“He was just an overzealous bureaucrat who injected his own opinion in legal matters that many times were disputed,” Donnadio said. “There should be some type of final arbiter before he tries these cases in the press without any due process.”
Walsh’s legacy, he added, “is that there should be some type of check and balance on giving someone that much power to say and do whatever they want.”
Donnadio’s association in 2024 urged legislative leaders to investigate Walsh’s office. That never happened, although Scutari recently tried to strip Walsh’s office of its investigatory powers before backpedaling after backlash from critics.
State senators aligned with South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross — whose allies have been targets of Walsh’s investigations — blocked Walsh’s confirmation, leaving him as acting comptroller for his entire time in office.
Walsh noted that much of the criticism has been lobbed by people he’s investigated.
“I welcome criticism. I don’t mind people saying what they have to say. It’s a good, healthy part of government, oversight, and democracy. But when that criticism comes in, especially when it is over-the-top, I see it for what it is — bluster that is intended to distract and discomfort with accountability,” he said.
Walsh added that, given how many policymakers say they want to make New Jersey more affordable, cracking down on fraud, waste, and abuse can achieve that “if we figure out the politics of it.”
“There is a playbook for the Sherrill administration in our reports and for legislators who care about affordability, especially at the local level, but also within Medicaid, about how one can protect taxpayer funds and get a more efficient government,” Walsh said.
Walsh praised Emehelu, a former federal prosecutor and ex-state executive assistant attorney general, as someone with “a great set of experiences that she’d bring to the job.”
“My sense is that the office is in great shape, and I’m looking forward to handing it off,” he said.
Walsh, a civil rights attorney who once headed the Fair Share Housing Center, considers a police accountability project he launched in 2022 to be among his more notable accomplishments. His office has exposed problematic police training, abuse of police courtesy cards, oversight lapses of police pensions, and other problems, and it annually reviews the performance of the state police.
“Reform without oversight is much less likely to be effective reform,” Walsh said. “So I’m really proud of our work in the area of police accountability, because it is work that helps policymakers and residents evaluate whether we are keeping our commitments on police reform.”
He expects he’ll continue to work in the public’s interest, and said he has ruled out a run for office (the comptroller is barred by state statute from seeking elected office for two years, though Walsh was never confirmed to the position).
“I have developed new skills in doing this work, so some combination of things for me is what I’m aiming to do,” he said. “But I have intentionally avoided engaging that just so that I could focus on this job all the way.”

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s public records watchdog is raising questions about a Republican-backed bill that would conceal the names of all law enforcement officers involved in immigration enforcement.
The Tennessee Coalition for Open Government put Senate Bill 1464 sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson at the top of its list for problematic bills this session.
“Changes need to be made in this bill. Secrecy can protect bad actors,” said Deborah Fisher, executive director of the coalition, in a release. “If identities must be confidential to protect a particular officer or official, it should be for a limited amount of time and based on real and documented threats.”
Johnson, a Franklin Republican spearheading the state’s efforts to remove undocumented immigrants, told the Lookout he’s willing to work with the Coalition for Open Government to avoid interfering with public records on law enforcement activities normally available to the public. 
Deborah Fisher with the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government says a bill to protect the identity of law enforcement officers engaging in immigration enforcement sacrifices public transparency. (Photo: submitted)
“But going out of your way to doxx or provide personal information about ICE officers with the intention of harassment or something for them and their families, that’s what we’re not going to tolerate,” Johnson said.
Johnson filed the bill in June 2025 after Metro Nashville listed the identities of some Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on its web site following a federal and state operation to round up immigrants without legal documentation in South Nashville. 
Metro Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell said the names listed inadvertently and were removed. But he still drew criticism from Republican lawmakers who are now focusing on Nashville with this measure.
Fisher said the bill also could require redaction of officers’ names from arrest affidavits, court filings and judicial records, giving “blanket” protection to state, local and federal officers who take part in immigration enforcement.
The bill contains no end date for the length of time that identities would remain confidential or a mechanism to make identities public even when it’s important for public oversight, Fisher said.
“The bill prioritizes safety of officers by redacting their names from records, but it sacrifices transparency,” Fisher said in the statement. She noted that it is possible to protect law enforcement officers without secrecy.
Republicans also introduced a separate package of bills last week designed to target undocumented immigrants statewide, mainly by requiring local and state governments to keep track of people’s immigration status.

Pete Ricketts touted provisions from Trump's tax and spending bill, hoping to be rewarded by Nebraska voters for it.","Nebraska U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts during his campaign event in Omaha on Jan. 16, 2026. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Nebraska Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts set up shop in the state’s most populous city as he faces his first real test as a Senate incumbent. 
Ricketts spoke to a crowd of 50 at the opening of his Omaha campaign office last week. He touched on similar notes to his previous campaign speeches, from “conservative leadership matters” to “conservative leadership delivers.” 
“We’re going to raise a bunch of money,” Ricketts told the crowd. “We’re going to spend a bunch of money … We’re going to be out there on TV talking about what we’re doing as Senate Republicans.” 
The former governor is in a heated campaign against former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn. The race has drawn national attention as Osborn hopes to build on his 2024 bid against U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., who beat him by 6 percentage points in a state where Republicans outnumber Democrats roughly 2 to 1 and nonpartisans make up a growing share of the electorate.

Ricketts touted President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill,” which Ricketts now calls the “working families tax cut.” The rebrand comes from the White House. He pointed to temporary provisions offering “no tax on tips” and “no tax on overtime” as examples of the Senate GOP “trying to put more money back” in people’s pockets after high inflation from the Biden administration.

The tax and spending law made most tax cuts from the first Trump administration permanent, cementing most of its benefits for higher earners. Its new work requirements for Medicaid and other social safety net programs are meant to offset the costs of the tax cuts and other funding for Trump’s domestic agenda.
Osborn has said the Trump tax and spending bill overwhelmingly benefits the wealthy “off the backs of people.” Osborn says he is campaigning on what the law actually does. He says it hurts working people.
Ricketts, like other Republicans facing reelection this year, is banking on changing public perception of the law. State and national Republican strategists are emphasizing specific provisions ahead of this year’s midterm elections. 
Ricketts highlighted a recent trip to the border in Texas. He was on in a group of GOP U.S. senators who visited the Rio Grande Valley to praise Trump’s border policies ahead of November’s midterm elections, according to the Texas Tribune. 
As he has for the past year, Ricketts painted Osborn, a registered nonpartisan, as secretly a Democrat. He describes Osborn’s nonpartisan approach as “fake.” 
Osborn and his team have laughed off the critics’ attempts, describing them as “comical.” Osborn has said he wants his campaign to connect with people who’ve given up on politics and who think the system wasn’t built for them.
Ricketts plans several campaign events this week with the Senate out for recess. The general election in the Senate race is Nov. 3.

(Photo: Getty Images)Tennessee construction companies are feeling the impact of the Trump administration immigration crackdown as workers failed to show up at job sites due to fears of enforcement activity, according to a survey by the Associated General Contractors of America.
The survey of all 50 states included responses from 22 commercial construction firms and contractors in Tennessee. Nearly a third of those surveyed reported annual revenues between $50 and $500 million; the majority were mid-sized firms, employing between 20 and 100 workers.
Over the past six months, 9% of Tennessee construction companies surveyed reported a jobsite was visited by immigration agents; 18% reported that workers failed to appear at work or left job sites “because of actual or rumored immigration actions”; and 32% reported their subcontractors had lost workers as a result of immigration enforcement actions.
Nearly one in four companies said they had adjusted project schedules or scopes due to labor or material shortages linked to immigration enforcement and other Trump policy changes.
A majority of companies listed economic worries as their biggest concerns for 2026, including fears of an economic slowdown or recession and the rising costs of labor and materials. 
The concerns of Tennessee businesses were echoed in other states.
“One reason for their lowered expectations is that contractors are increasingly worried about the broader economy, the possibility of a recession, and the outlook for materials costs amid ongoing uncertainty around tariffs and trade policy,” the survey concluded. “At the same time, many firms remain concerned about persistent labor shortages and also report plans to boost investments in artificial intelligence to improve efficiency.”

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The 2026 election cycle marks the first time a new Republican Party of Arkansas rule prohibiting registered Democrats from voting in GOP primary races will be enforced. 
The new rule has an impact in a state where Republicans hold every statewide partisan office, every seat in the congressional delegation and a majority in both chambers of the Legislature. 
This spring’s primary election features contested Republican primaries for several races, including U.S. Senate, secretary of state and some high-profile state legislative seats. The primary election is March 3 and the general election is Nov. 3.
Here’s what to know about the rule change: 
Who can participate in primary elections?
Arkansas’ preferential primary elections have been open, meaning voters can choose if they want to vote a ballot with Republican candidates or one with Democrat candidates, regardless of the voters’ registered party affiliation. 
That changed when the Republican Party of Arkansas voted at its state committee meeting in June to approve a new rule that prohibits registered Democrats from voting in Republican primaries. 
What does the new GOP rule say?
“Qualified electors shall NOT be a registered Democrat before being issued a Republican primary ballot to vote in a Republican party primary election,” according to the updated party rules.
Republican Party of Arkansas Chairman Joseph Wood said the purpose of the rule is to prevent voters registered as Democrats from participating in Republican primary elections.
Who suggested the rule?
Republican Sen. Joshua Bryant of Rogers presented the rule. Having experienced open and closed primaries living in different states, Bryant said he can see both sides and didn’t really have a stance on the issue. However, he suggested the rule in response to some “endfighting” in the party over closing primaries. 
Proponents of closed primaries are often concerned about voters changing their party affiliation to sway the results of the opposing party’s race, which could happen in races decided by a handful of votes, Bryant said. 
The GOP’s new rule makes the party’s primaries “semi-closed,” he said, because there are still ways for voters who aren’t registered Republicans to vote in Republican primaries.
“If you are convicted in your policy beliefs to be a registered Democrat, then stay as a registered Democrat, don’t vote in Republican primaries,” Bryant said. “Otherwise remove your registration to Optional or Republican or Libertarian and then come on over.” 
However, Bryant said the Democrat and Republican platforms are different enough that if someone wants to “wear that banner” as a registered Democrat, they should “just stay in your lane.”
Do Democrats have the same rule?
Democrat primaries remain open, and anyone can participate, Democratic Party of Arkansas Communications Director Micah Wallace said. 
“Any voters that wish to participate in the Democratic primary are welcome to do so,” Wallace said. “We didn’t close our primary because there’s no reason to. We want to invite more voters to participate in the Democratic primary.”
Wallace said the new Republican primary rule makes voting appear more inaccessible in a state that already has low voter participation. 
“While this does virtue-signal how exclusive and cliqueish the Arkansas GOP is, it doesn’t actually prevent many Democrats from participating in the Republican primary if they are determined to do so,” she said.
Do I have to pick a party?
Arkansans are not required to select a party affiliation when they register to vote. Arkansas voters can register as an Independent (Party Optional). Independents can choose whether they want to vote in Republican or Democrat primaries. Or they can choose to vote only in the non-partisan judicial elections March 3. 
Nearly 87% of registered voters have their party listed as Optional, according to the secretary of state’s office. 
Can I switch party affiliations?
Yes. You can change your party affiliation prior to the election by contacting your local county clerk or at the polls on Election Day. 
Chris Powell, the secretary of state’s director of public affairs, said his office doesn’t see a lot of voters switch party affiliations around election time, and they have not noticed an unusual number of changes ahead of the March primary.
What happens if there’s a runoff in the primary?
If you choose to vote in a Republican primary election, you can’t vote in a Democrat primary runoff, and vice versa. There’s no “crossover voting” between a primary and a runoff, Powell said.
Who’s eligible to vote in the March 3 primary?
Arkansans must be registered to vote by Feb. 2 to be eligible to cast a ballot in the March 3 preferential primary election and the nonpartisan judicial election. State law requires you to present a photo ID to vote. 
Details about how to register to vote are available on the secretary of state’s website.

(Photo courtesy of the Idaho Community Foundation)One thing seems certain about this year’s legislative session. With a daunting budget shortfall lying before them, it’s a good bet that trimming budgets will be high on the lawmakers’ “do” list.
That means saying “no” to a lot of heart-wrenching causes in state government and, perhaps, to nonprofits as well. Kevin Bailey, who heads the Idaho Community Foundation’s Nonprofit Center, is well aware of the challenges and lends a sympathetic eye to legislators who have to make hard decisions.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little wants more Medicaid cuts, but not to repeal expansion

“It’s a difficult job,” he says. “There will be around 700 bills introduced, along with dozens and dozens of special interests making requests.”
The community foundation is one of the groups with a “policy agenda” for this session, but it’s one than legislators might be receptive to in this cost-cutting environment. Nonprofits receive almost no general fund dollars.
 “It’s largely maintaining appropriations for grants that are paid with federal dollars, such as Meals on Wheels for seniors,” Bailey says. 
The center’s wish list includes maintaining property tax exemptions for nonprofits, supporting appropriations that enhance nonprofits’ ability to provide essential community services and keeping the federal and state tax codes friendly toward charitable giving. The agenda also backs initiatives that promote increasing the supply “of high-quality affordable child care, policies that allow for innovative/pooled employee benefit solutions, and policies that ensure a stable and affordable health insurance market for employers, which affects all businesses (nonprofit and for-profit alike).”
Bailey says that Idaho legislators generally are supportive of nonprofits, and for good reason. “Idaho runs on nonprofits,” he says.
He makes a good point. Something I have learned in my 10 months writing about nonprofits is that this state is full of good people doing good things – with minimal, if any, help from the government. And this is what Bailey sees every day in his job.
“I think about it from the aspect of my own family life,” Bailey says. “Nonprofits are places of worship, after-school programs, child care, places we send our kids for summer camps, the Discovery Center, the performances we see at the Morrison Center. Nonprofits are like oxygen … we take them for granted, but people will notice if you take them away and our communities will die off.”
For conservative-minded legislators, nonprofits help keep government small by providing social services that substantially are not paid by taxpayer dollars.
“Nonprofits are a good deal for the taxpayer because in many ways, they save the state from having to create its own programs,” Bailey says. “Not all nonprofits are perfect, certainly there are exceptions, but nonprofits are local, generally small and are well managed. Almost all have 10 to 25 board members who make decisions about the community and organizations that they shepherd. If that’s not democracy in action, then I don’t know what is.”
As with other groups, Bailey says, there are advocates at the Statehouse lobbying for the center’s policy agenda and other issues of interest to nonprofits. As Bailey sees it, there’s a critical need for having that presence.
“Nonprofits should be at the table when it comes to public policy,” he says. “If you are not at the table, then you’re on the menu.”

Michael Bennet are raising campaign funds at a roughly equal clip in their head-to-head contest for the Democratic nomination for Colorado governor, but a billionaire-funded group backing Bennet is amassing a cash advantage as the primary election heats up.
Weiser, who launched his campaign on Jan. 2 last year, raised a total of over $4.6 million over the course of 2025, according to campaign finance disclosures filed with the secretary of state’s office last week.
After entering the race on April 10, Bennet raised about $3.5 million, about three-quarters of Weiser’s total, in the last three quarters of the year.

Both candidates said their fundraising numbers demonstrated strong grassroots support, including from small-dollar donors. Colorado’s campaign finance laws limit direct campaign contributions to $725 per individual, and corporate contributions are prohibited.
“Michael is running for Governor to protect Colorado from Donald Trump’s chaos and deliver a stronger, more affordable future for our state — and his robust grassroots support shows that Coloradans are behind him,” Nellie Moran, Bennet’s campaign manager, said in a statement.
Weiser’s campaign highlighted its $3.4 million in cash on hand at the beginning of 2026 — more than double the Bennet campaign’s figure of just under $1.6 million.
But Bennet stands to benefit from millions in spending by an independent expenditure committee, better known as a super PAC, that is supporting his campaign. Super PACs can raise unlimited sums of money from individuals, corporations and nonprofits, but they are barred from coordinating directly with candidates.
Rocky Mountain Way, the super PAC supporting Bennet, has raised over $3.3 million from 82 donors who have contributed an average of nearly $44,000 each. The group’s top donors, accounting for half of its total receipts, are former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Brighter Future for Colorado, a so-called dark money nonprofit that does not disclose its donors.
“We don’t have out-of-state billionaires behind us,” Weiser said in a press release. “We have the people of Colorado powering our campaign and responding to our commitment to fight for Colorado and to always show up, listen, and deliver results.”
Weiser also has super PAC support from the group Fighting For Colorado, which has raised $562,651 since it was registered in August 2025. Seventy-one donors have contributed an average of $7,947. Its top donors — Jason Mendelson, Tom Ray, Arthur Reimers and Jim Kelley — are all venture capitalists or private equity investors who have contributed $50,000 each.
Weiser, a former law professor, is serving his second term as attorney general after he was first elected in 2018.
Bennet is a former Denver Public Schools superintendent who was appointed to the Senate by Gov. Bill Ritter in 2009. He ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020 before winning reelection to a third full term in 2022.
The winner of the primary between Weiser and Bennet will be heavily favored to win the general election in November. Coloradans have elected only one Republican governor in the last 50 years. Democrats have won every statewide election held in the last eight years by an average of more than 10 percentage points, and are widely expected to gain ground in a favorable midterm election year.
Democratic Gov. Jared Polis is term-limited. The primary election is June 30.

Patrick Morrisey is asking lawmakers to increase funding for the federal food assistance program SNAP by $13.5 million. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Patrick Morrisey is asking lawmakers to increase funding for the federal food assistance program SNAP by $13.5 million in fiscal year 2027 to make up for changes brought about by federal legislation, state budget officials said this week.
Currently, the federal government pays 100% of SNAP benefits, and the state and the federal government evenly split the administrative costs of the program. 
Beginning Oct. 1, under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law July 4, 2025, states will take on 75% of the program’s administrative cost, while the federal government will cover 25% of those costs.
The $13.5 million increase would cover the state portion of the administrative costs for the first nine months of 2027, budget director Mike McKown told the Senate Finance Committee Thursday. It will cost $18 million to cover the state portion of the administrative costs for the entire year, he said. 
Lawmakers would have to approve the request. 
Generally, Morrisey has directed state agencies not to try to replace lost federal funding. McKown said of the $21 billion appropriated in the proposed budget bill, half are federal funds.
“West Virginia relies very heavily on federal funds. There is no way we could supplement or replace all those federal dollars if that ever happens,” he said. “There’s questions about how certain programs are going to be affected in future. It’s way too early to determine some of those, but we do have some answers on some of that.”
Each federal program will be looked at separately and some exceptions will be made, McKown said. 
Angel Hightower, a communications specialist for the state Department of Human Services, told West Virginia Watch that the administrative costs for SNAP include personnel, technology, operations, informing the public about SNAP and detecting fraud, and direct program support. 
About 275,000 West Virginia residents — or one in six — rely on SNAP, commonly referred to as food stamps. 
McKown said the state could also be on the hook to pay for some of the cost of SNAP benefits beginning in 2028 unless it decreases its SNAP payment error rate, a measure of accuracy of each state’s eligibility and benefit determination. 
The federal government currently pays the entire cost of SNAP benefits, which equal $565 million in West Virginia, McKown said. 
Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, beginning in 2028, states that have a SNAP error rate of more than 6% will be required to take on between 5 and 5% of the cost of SNAP benefits in their states, depending on how high their error rate is.  
For West Virginia, that would amount to approximately $28 million on the low end, and about $84 million at the highest, based on McKown’s estimate of the cost of SNAP benefits paid to West Virginians. 
In 2024, the latest numbers that are available, West Virginia had a SNAP error rate of 9.43%. In 2023, the error rate was 10.98%.
In 2024, only eight states had error rates below 6%. 
Hightower said the agency has developed a “multifaceted approach” to address the payment error rate. 
The plan includes enhanced local monitoring, increased quality control and targeted training. The plan also includes changing most SNAP cases with a 12-month reporting period to a 6-month period, which provides greater flexibility and coordination for the Department of Human Services, while reducing required paperwork for most SNAP households, Hightower said. 
Since the plan was implemented, the state’s payment error rate has decreased from 9.43% to 6.37% for fiscal year 2025, Hightower said. 
“This strategic rollout is designed to establish a continuous improvement loop, using weekly accountability reports and monthly timeliness data to track progress and enforce corrective actions across all local offices,” Hightower said. 
Caitlin Cook, director of advocacy and public policy for Mountaineer Food Bank, told West Virginia Watch she’s “delighted” the governor included the $13.5 million SNAP increase in his proposed budget. 
Without the additional funding, Cook said she’s concerned the agency may not be able to lower its payment error rate.
“By fully funding that additional administrative cost share that the state will be on the hook starting Oct. 1, that puts us in a better position to lower the error rate, and hopefully be below 6% so the state share of those whose benefits is zero,” she said.

Josh Stein's State of the State address on March 12, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)One supposes that it’s not an especially unusual phenomenon for politicians who ascend to power to do everything they can to cling to it. Between the ability to shape public policy and the trappings that come with inhabiting high office, political power is almost always an addictive drug that’s hard to kick. That said, it’s also one of the hallmarks and great strengths of American democracy that, for most of the last 250 years, politicians of all parties have accepted – usually honorably – the will of voters.
Tragically, however, this great tradition of honor and discipline was egregiously abandoned by Donald Trump in the aftermath of the 2020 election – an action that led directly to the infamous January 6, 2021, insurrection. And now, five years later, it’s clear that this new practice of, when necessary, taking every conceivable step to evade the will of the citizenry in order to cling to power, has become the new modus operandi of Trump’s party in North Carolina.
We, of course, should have seen this coming. That the fear of voter decisions and the willingness to subvert them had become a new Republican tactic of choice was first made blatantly obvious in 2013 when the GOP-dominated General Assembly began enacting election law changes (like the infamous Monster Voting Law) that went to extreme lengths to both suppress the vote of disfavored groups – most notably voters of color – and rig electoral outcomes through the use of  extreme partisan gerrymandering.
The practice continued in the weeks immediately following the 2016 election. That was the period during which the lame duck GOP-dominated General Assembly hastily convened to enact laws stripping the newly elected Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, of an array of basic powers long and logically attached to the office.
Never mind that voters chose Cooper with the eminently reasonable expectation that he would wield authority – like numerous important appointment powers — long and naturally associated with the role of a state’s chief executive. Ignoring the obvious will of voters, GOP legislators moved quickly to remove them, and in most instances, seize them for themselves.
And in recent years, sadly, this trend has only continued to metastasize and become even more ingrained.
See, for example, the ongoing effort to take gerrymandering to ever greater depths by, quite literally, rendering the results of almost all legislative elections foreordained and rigged to elect large Republican majorities. Late last year, the GOP took this practice to a new and truly preposterous level when, heeding the dictates of Dear Leader Trump, it further rigged the state’s congressional elections so that our deeply purple state will almost assuredly be represented by a U.S. House delegation of 11 Republicans and 3 Democrats.
And then of course, there was the almost laughably bizarre move to, in the aftermath of Democrat Josh Stein’s landslide victory in the 2024 election, seize even more gubernatorial power – like appointing the state Board of Elections – and hand it to, of all people, the state’s accountant (i.e. the auditor). It was move so blatant and utterly contemptuous of the will of voters that it left many observers to conclude that Republicans would have gladly handed the seized power over to whatever GOP office holder happened to be handy – the Labor Commissioner? Agriculture Commissioner? – if the new GOP auditor, Dave Boliek, hadn’t been so cynically ready and willing to play along.
But wait, there’s more. As NC Newsline’s Brandon Kingdollar reported on January 19, the governor’s office isn’t the only one from which Republicans have shown themselves more than willing to seize powers in contravention of the voters’ judgment. Newly elected Democratic Attorney General Jeff Jackson is also a target.
Despite ample evidence that Jackson has worked hard to approach the task in a nonpartisan manner guided by the letter of the law and the likelihood of demonstrable harm to our state, Republican legislators advanced legislation last year that would strip the AG’s office of one of its central and most important constitutional duties – to challenge unlawful presidential executive orders that harm the state. One GOP lawmaker even promised he and his colleagues would wreak vengeance and render Jackson’s office “a feckless, empty shell of a position that has no authority to do anything,” if he dared to contest their action. Try to imagine that such a move could have occurred if Dan Bishop were AG and Kamala Harris in the White House.
All these moves come on top of many years of repeated legislative microaggressions toward Democrats elected to Council of State offices like the Superintendent of Public Instruction and Secretary of State via budget cuts and other power grabs.
Will this trend continue in the New Year? It’s hard to imagine that it won’t. While gerrymandering and political power jockeying has always been a feature of American politics, the modern, Trumpified Republican Party has taken both phenomena to new and extreme levels never seen before in American history. The only question that remains at this point is how much longer voters will stand for the fear and contempt directed their way by politicians supposedly sworn to serve them.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0870-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 06:57:38.196710

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee electric vehicle owners — and those passing through the Volunteer state — could find themselves paying a little extra at public charging stations if state lawmakers approve a new bill meant to mirror a gas tax.
As introduced, the bill would institute a tax of $0.03 per kilowatt-hour on public charging stations. The tax would apply to DC fast chargers, which have a charging capacity of 20 kilowatts or more. Residential chargers and those with charging capacity of less than 20 kilowatts would be exempt.
This new tax would be in addition to annual extra vehicle registration fees that began in 2024: $200 for electric vehicle owners and $100 for hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle owners. Registration rates will rise to $274 per year for electric vehicles starting Jan. 1, 2027.
Sen. Page Walley, a Savannah Republican, introduced the bill. He said Tennessee levies a gas tax as a revenue source for maintaining roadways, and instituted the electric vehicle registration fee in 2024 to contribute to road maintenance, since electric vehicle owners do not pay gas tax.

“One of the shortcomings, though, we have discovered, is that all these tourists and folks traveling through our state who are using our roads, many of them obviously will pay the gas tax when they stop and refuel, but those that are using hybrids or EVs and are charging those at charging stations — let’s say, at Buc-ee’s or somewhere else — are not contributing anything to the maintenance of our roads,” Walley said.
But layering a new tax on top of the registration fee is punitive for EV drivers, according to Anne Blair, vice president of policy and freight at the Electrification Coalition, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization that promotes electric vehicle adoption.
“Even with just the registration fee that Tennessee EV drivers pay, that is already much more than what your typical gasoline driver pays in gas tax,” Blair said.
In Tennessee, gasoline-powered vehicle drivers pay 27.4 cents per gallon in tax. The amount of tax paid depends on a vehicle’s fuel efficiency and miles of travel, but generally ranges from $115 to $280, according to various estimates from the U.S. Department of Energy, The Sycamore Institute, and Drive Electric Tennessee.
Walley said his bill is modeled after the electric vehicle charging tax instituted in Kentucky.
A handful of states, including Kentucky, have both additional registration fees for electric vehicles and taxes on publicly available chargers. Kentucky passed legislation approving a $0.03 per kilowatt-hour tax on high-capacity charges in 2024, exempting lower-capacity chargers and free-to-use chargers at churches, libraries, parks and other places likely to have slower chargers.
Walley said he believes most EV owners in Tennessee charge their vehicles at home, or when they visit friends or family. 
“But folks that are traveling through typically are going to be using, as Kentucky has found, these more publicly accessible (chargers), so that’s the logic,” he said.
The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that among EV owners, about 80% of charging happens at home. 










We need funding for our roads, but we need to holistically think about what those opportunities are to change the collection mechanism that is not reliant or not tied to a fuel type … but rather the use of roads.


– Anne Blair, Electrification Coalition


Tennessee had 64,910 electric vehicles on the road as of September 2025, according to an Atlas Public Policy analysis of state registration data. 
In Montana, which has a $0.03 per kilowatt-hour tax, an EV driver with no access to a home charger would pay an estimated $120 per year (assuming they use 4,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity and drive 12,000 miles annually), according to an Atlas Public Policy study released in September 2025. An EV driver with access to a home charger would pay closer to $24 in annual charging tax.
Electrification Coalition Policy Manager Skye Golann cautioned that a “large contingent” of people rely on public charging, including residents of multi-unit dwellings and rideshare drivers, who are disproportionately likely to drive electric vehicles due to cost savings compared to gas.
“It’s a broader group of drivers that are using those than people might think when they’re imagining just people coming through from out of state,” Golann said.
Blair said the Electrification Coalition is not completely opposed to fees for EV drivers, but “there should be some account for those EV drivers in the state that are needing to use the charger.”
Better yet, she said, the state and the nation could consider broad-scale changes to how governments pay for transportation infrastructure.
“We need funding for our roads, but we need to holistically think about what those opportunities are to change the collection mechanism that is not reliant or not tied to a fuel type … but rather the use of roads,” Blair said.

Patrick Morrisey gives his State of the State address in the West Virginia Capitol in Charleston, West Virginia, on Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026. (Photo by Perry Bennett/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Gov. Patrick Morrisey gave his second State of the State address last week, and the speech failed to touch on some of the state’s biggest problems.
Many of West Virginians’ issues stem from poverty, yet Morrisey only mentioned a 3% raise for state employees. Why not raise the state minimum wage? The last time West Virginia saw an increase in the minimum wage was in 2015. The $8.75 an hour isn’t even half of the $19.43 living wage that a single person with no children needs to support themself.
West Virginia has the highest average utility bill in the nation, with residents paying about $42 more per month than they were last year. WTOV talked to Delaney Eddy, state coordinator for West Virginia 211, who said there’s been an increased demand for utility assistance.
Morrisey did acknowledge “significant increases in all forms of energy” prices for West Virginians, but didn’t share any plans on how West Virginia can control those costs.
Health care costs are increasing and people who rely on the Public Employee Insurance Agency or use the Affordable Care Act Marketplace to purchase insurance are particularly feeling the pain. Morrisey said that instead of a 14% increase in premium rates for PEIA users, this year they would only see a 3% increase, and that in order to fix PEIA the “Legislature will need to work with me on real reforms.” He gave no hint on what his ideas for reform were.
People who use the ACA Marketplace are seeing their premiums increase by 133%, because of expiring premium tax credits that Congress hasn’t renewed. West Virginians already have poor health; in 2021, the state per capita led the nation in deaths caused by cancer (184.7 deaths per 100,000), drug overdoses (90.9), diabetes (47.6) and kidney disease (25.8), according to mortality data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
This won’t change if people can’t afford to go to the doctor. They’ll suffer, get worse, self medicate or die. When we already have such a severe drug problem, we can’t afford to let our people continue to self medicate.
West Virginia is losing more than $1 billion per year in Medicaid funding for its hospitals under cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The Rural Health Transformation Program will only provide the state $199 million for 2026 — and some of that money is going to go to salaries of temporary state employees. 
So what did Morrisey have to say about our health crisis? He talked about his Mountaineer Mile initiative, which encourages everyone to walk one mile a day, last year’s law to remove artificial food dyes from food — which is now being held up in court — and banning SNAP recipients from buying soda with their benefits. He also mentioned the reinstatement of the Presidential Fitness test, a way to make children hate gym class by making them feel bad for not being able to climb a rope.
Thousands of West Virginians don’t have access to clean drinking water, but there was no mention of a solution for that. At least Morrisey did ask lawmakers for $10 million to fund a flood preparation initiative. The state’s flood fund has been empty since its creation, and multiple devastating floods happen each year in the state.
There wasn’t a single mention of schools closing and consolidating.
According to the state Department of Education, at least five public schools closed in 2025, and 16 closed in 2024, up from nine in 2023 and five in 2022. 
Instead, Morrisey focused on the state’s school voucher program, the Hope Scholarship, which is expected to cost around $230 million. Morrisey said that the state has “built it into our baseline so that Hope funding is not dependent upon surpluses.” He also said the state is “pre-paying” all of next year’s Hope Scholarship “as a commitment to this policy.”
Some Republicans have raised concerns over the increased costs of the program, and House Democrats are expected to introduce bills to put guardrails on how the money can be spent. 
I will give Morrisey credit for addressing two issues — bridge infrastructure and literacy.
Morrisey said he wants to give $100 million to supplement road and bridge repair work. About 17% of the state’s bridges are in poor condition, about 56% are in fair condition, and only about 27% are in good condition. This money is desperately needed.
He also said the state will implement LETRS, a program that Mississippi used to go from being ranked at the bottom in public education to the top. In 2024, 75% of West Virginia’s fourth graders were not proficient in reading.
We’re only a week in, but hopefully soon we’ll get more details on how Morrisey hopes to tackle some of these issues.

There were balloons, a DJ playing uptempo music, a line of people waiting with plates at the buffet. A table was piled with boxes and wrapped gifts, including Nike sneakers, restaurant gift cards, and bottles of whiskey and tequila. 
And there was Olivia Detsavanh carrying her phone around the room so people could offer greetings to the two guests of honor who couldn’t be with the 100 or so people in attendance.
Olivia’s father, John Detsavanh, 52, and her uncle, Mike Detsavanh, 50, were calling from custody at the Wyatt Detention Facility, the maximum security federal detention center in Central Falls. They had been held at the Wyatt since Sept. 11 when ICE agents picked up the brothers separately in Providence. Olivia’s dad John was on his way to work; her uncle was driving Olivia’s younger sister to school. 
The gathering at the Brightridge Club was a fundraiser for the brothers. All the items on the table were prizes in a raffle to raise money for their legal advocacy and other expenses. At one point, the music stopped, and Olivia took the microphone. She described her father as a funny and generous man who is quick to offer help. Her uncle, Mike, she said, was “selfless, dependable and loyal.” 
Their detention had shattered her family, she said. Her younger sister will now have to finish high school and navigate life without two strong male figures. Her older sister canceled her upcoming wedding because her father wouldn’t be able to walk her down the aisle. Their grandmother, in ailing health, no longer had her son Mike to diligently take care of her.
“This fight is not over,” Olivia said. “We can’t give up on trying to get them, not only back home, but justice.”
But three weeks after the fundraiser, the brothers were deported to Laos, a country that they left as child refugees.

Lao community in shock
In the first year of the second Trump administration, the United States deported more than 100 people to Laos, the rural, mountainous Southeast Asian country where the U.S. conducted a “Secret War” from 1964 to 1973. During the entire four years President Joe Biden was in office, the number was just six, according to data from the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center in Washington, D.C.
In Rhode Island — which has been a settlement area for Southeast Asian refugees since the 1970s — at least six Rhode Island men of Lao descent were deported by immigration authorities in 2025. All of them arrived legally in the U.S. as children and were granted refugee status. All of them were subsequently convicted of crimes that led to removal orders. 
But those orders were never carried out for years, even decades. 
In the 1990s, the Detsavanh brothers pleaded guilty to felony charges for their part in a series of gang-related robberies of local restaurants as teenagers in Florida. They moved to Rhode Island after prison, started fresh, and settled into lives with regular check-ins with enforcement authorities. Neither has had a run-in with the criminal justice system since. During that time, John got married, had kids, and volunteered with PrYSM, a Providence  advocacy organization focused on the Southeast Asian community. Mike became a popular barber in Providence. All told, 29 years passed between their deportation orders and actual removal from the country in November.. 
The wave of recent deportations to Laos has left Rhode Island’s Southeast Asian community reeling. Supporters have held protests, and launched fundraisers. They have held campaigns to call and email ICE and elected officials to urge intervention in these cases. Family members of deportees — pressed unexpectedly into public positions of advocacy —  have participated in interviews, forums, and documentaries to try to raise awareness. 
“Everybody’s scared,” PrySYM Deportation Defense Director Theary Voeul told Rhode Island Current. “I get calls every day from folks that [ask], ‘Theary, is it safe for me to even go outside?’” 
It no longer mattered that these deported men had come to the United States as refugees from the most bombed country in the world per capita. And that the United States is the very country that dropped more than 2 million tons of bombs on Laos, more than were dropped on Germany and Japan combined during World War II.
And it no longer mattered that they had turned their lives around. The Detsavanh brothers had the longest stretch between their deportation orders and their removals among other recent Rhode Islanders deported to Laos. The others had remained in the U.S. between five months and 18 years since their ordered removal.

‘Ripped out from under them’
The deportations reflect what Providence-based immigration attorney Zachary Lyons calls a new “extreme enforcement posture” by the Trump administration. Previously, various factors, including limited ICE resources or a lack of a formal repatriation agreement between countries, might keep a person in the U.S. years after their ordered removal, Lyons says. (The U.S. still has no formal repatriation agreement with Laos, according to the Asian Law Caucus.) Now, people are being arrested in the streets, at work, or detained at check-in appointments with ICE they went to for years without incident.
Because those targeted had been here for so long, the impact of their removal has been more pronounced. The U.S. government has allowed them to remain and have children, go to school, perhaps marry or start a business. “Now all of that is being ripped out from under them…in an instant,” Lyons said.  
In May 2025, community members rallied at the Wyatt Detention Facility to call for the release of three Laotian men – Khek Choummala, Manoutham Phommachan and Vanhhatdy Souvannaxa – who had recently been detained. All had previous convictions for criminal charges, but had served their sentences. In each case, supporters launched fundraisers and petitions to try to stop their loved ones’ deportation. But all three were eventually deported.  
In response to questions about their cases, ICE spokesman Christopher Celozzi stated that the three men had “entered the United States lawfully; however, they violated the terms of their lawful admissions.” Phommachan’s charges included felony firearm possession and felony possession of a controlled substance. Souvannaxa had been convicted for knowingly receiving and possessing a pipe bomb and maliciously damaging by means of fire and explosive materials a building resulting in personal injury, both felonies. Celozzi confirmed all were deported on May 25, 2025. 
Rhode Island Current reached out to Souvannaxa and Phommachan, as well as their spouses, but received no response. In an August 2025 interview with Ocean State Media (formerly The Public’s Radio), Souvannaxa’s wife, Cassie, described her husband as “somebody who has already done their time, and they’re still treated like a criminal.” In a short documentary film released in October, Phommachan’s wife, Saroeur, described him as a “great husband” and “wonderful father.” Rhode Island Current was unable to contact Choummala or a representative.
‘Dropped into poverty’
Southeast Asian refugees landing in Rhode Island after the Vietnam War ended in 1975 primarily settled in Providence and Woonsocket. In 2022, the Rhode Island Laotian population was 2,890. New arrivals faced a long list of challenges, including separation from family members, memories of horrific violence, a new language and culture, and dramatically different climate.

Phaykham Phrachanhsiri, 46, grew up in Providence after his family arrived in Boston legally as refugees in 1981 when he was 2 years old and his sister Phayvanh was 5. Their father had fought against Communism in Laos during the Vietnam War. When the war ended and Communists took over the country, his dad was arrested and beaten and tortured in custody. 
Phaykham went by the nicknames “Ai” and “Eggroll.” His parents struggled with English and worked a lot, sometimes two jobs. His sister, Phayvanh Phrachanhsiri, who now works as an emergency department nurse in Houston, said she and her brother were essentially left to navigate this new country alone. 
“We were dropped into poverty,” she said. 
In 2005, in Texas, Ai Phrachanhsiri pleaded guilty to one federal charge of involving use of a phone in connection to a drug deal, as part of a broader sting related to the trafficking of ecstasy. He served two years of a 37-month sentence and was released from prison in late 2007. As part of his punishment, he was also ordered to be deported. The order was never carried out. 
Eighteen years passed between his ordered removal and his arrest and deportation by ICE in 2025. In that time, he moved back to Rhode Island and stayed out of trouble. He found work at various body shops in Rhode Island. He most recently worked at a West Warwick shop where he ran a concierge collision recovery program that handles pick-up and drop-off for the damaged car, rental car arrangements, and logistics coordination with insurance providers. 
On Aug. 18, ICE agents arrested Ai Phrachanhsiri at his job. He was deported in early November. 
“Ai is not just someone being deported,” read a testimonial on a GoFundMe campaign launched after his arrest. “He is a brother, a son, a friend, and a man with a heart of gold.”

The GoFundMe campaign ended, and the page has since been taken down. 
When Phayvanh heard the news of her brother’s deportation, she said she couldn’t stop crying. Her brother had come to the U.S. legally, as a toddler. Now, he was “leaving America in shackles,” she said.
In a statement, ICE Boston spokesman James Covington acknowledged that Ai Phrachanhsiri entered the country legally, but violated the terms of his lawful admission. 
“Phaykham Phrachansiri is an illegal alien from Laos whose criminal history includes a conviction for using a communication facility during the commission of a drug trafficking crime,” Covington said.
In a phone interview Monday from Laos, Phrachanhsiri said he considers himself lucky to have an uncle and cousins in Laos who have helped him with the transition.
But his new life remains difficult. He has no citizenship and no driver’s license. He cannot read or write in the local language. He hasn’t yet landed a job. And he misses his family and friends in the U.S. An avid fisherman who loved to fish for striped bass and flounder off the coast of Rhode Island, he’s tried fishing in landlocked Laos but said it’s not the same.
“There’s no ocean over here,” he said. “It’s just all ponds.”
 Legislation aimed to offer special case exceptions
In recent years, members of Congress introduced legislation that would carve out deportation protections for certain Southeast Asian refugees, acknowledging the population’s unique experiences and their reasons for living in the U.S. 
Minnesota U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum introduced the “Hmong and Lao Refugee Deportation Prohibition Act of 2020,” which called for a six-year stoppage of deportations to Laos so that people with final orders of removal could have their cases reassessed. Two years later, California U.S. Rep. Alan Lowenthal introduced the “Southeast Asian Deportation Relief Act of 2022,” which aimed to establish limits on DHS’s authority to deport refugees from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia who arrived in the U.S. before 2008.
Neither bill passed. 
Quyen Dinh, the executive director of the Washington-based Southeast Asia Resource Action Center (SEARAC) recommends legal representation for Southeast Asian folks facing deportation. “The odds of success really increase,” she said. “But the legal field has been so inundated that it’s really hard to find an attorney, period.” 
Dinh calls the jump in deportations to Laos from the Biden administration to the first year of Trump’s second term an “exponential” and “astronomical” shift.
In Rhode Island, PrYSM has published a Google doc called the “Lao Deportation Toolkit: A Guide for Lao Individuals Facing Deportation,” outlining what to expect upon arrival in the country. It includes information about the state-run compound in Laos where U.S. deportees are held until securing a sponsor to officially enter the country, the sponsorship process, and warnings on how to avoid exploitation.
The toolkit links to Facebook groups for deportees and their families; shares a visitor’s guide to the country’s capital, Vientiane; and offers guidance on local access to transportation, housing, banking, and health care. One section advises that many employers in Laos are hesitant to hire people over the age of 40. “Many folks are finding jobs in the service industry,” the toolkit said. “Our advice is to look into getting certified as an English teacher.”
The document states it was developed “out of PrYSM’s experience in supporting Rhode Island community members as they’ve navigated detention, deportation, and resettlement in Laos.”

‘Prioritizing public safety’ vs. social justice concerns
The Department of Homeland Security says detentions and deportations during Trump’s second term are about keeping people safe. 
Asked to comment on the deportation of the Detsavanh brothers, Covington pointed to their convictions on three counts of armed robbery and noted that the felonies violated the terms of their admission as refugees. Mike’s deportation order was in 1995 and John’s in 1996.
John Detsavanh’s daughter, Olivia, says her father and uncle were wrongly convicted. 
In an interview posted to Instagram, she said as teens her father and uncle were “nerds” who were bullied and threatened into participation in the crimes for which they were convicted. When they were interrogated by the police, they weren’t offered the presence of a lawyer or parent, she said. 
In her view, there were three stages to the injustice her father and uncle endured at the hands of the United States. The first was the country’s military intervention in Laos that made them refugees in the first place. The second was what she believes was their wrongful conviction. The third is their detention and deportation by ICE.
Olivia described herself as normally private and reserved. But because her father and uncle would do anything for anybody, she feels compelled to do anything she can for them. 
“I had to speak out for at least my father and my uncle, since they don’t currently have a voice,” she said.

(Getty Images)Less than a year ago, the General Assembly created the Kentucky Film Leadership Council, giving it the responsibility of reviewing and approving taxpayer subsidies for projects filmed in the state. The film council held its first meeting in July.
The owner of the Lexington-based studio Wrigley Media, Misdee Wrigley Miller, was out front advocating for the council’s creation. In 2017, Wrigley Miller acquired a majority share of Post Time Productions, renamed it and transformed a former multiplex movie theater into a 50,000-square-foot production studio.
Wrigley Miller has been a generous campaign contributor, donating a total of $44,800 to various Kentucky political campaigns and legislative caucus committees since 2020. So, when it came time for Gov. Andy Beshear to appoint the film council’s new members, it should come as no surprise that she got the gig. 
One of the film council’s first actions was adopting bylaws that prescribe how it would conduct its business. A standard feature of an organization’s bylaws is a conflict-of-interest policy, which the film council included as part of theirs. 
The policy states that no member of the film council “shall have ownership in any firm … interested in a contract or agreement with the council.” Pretty strong stuff — negated, more or less, by the next provision requiring only that a member with a financial interest in a project being considered for subsidies disclose their interest and refrain from discussing or voting on the project’s application.
The film council’s meeting packets and minutes are posted online. Twenty-nine projects have been approved for financial awards since August. Of those, Wrigley Miller disclosed a financial interest in eight of the projects and left the room while they were being discussed and voted on. All eight were approved, qualifying for a total of $8,318,260 in subsidies. 
Another film council member, Jeremy Winton, the co-founder of the Kentucky Sound Stage in Owensboro, appears to be feeding from the same trough. In accordance with the bylaws, Winton has removed himself nine times from the council’s discussion of projects he was involved with.
I’d say this kind of thing happens all the time in Frankfort, but this is pretty brazen. The film council has only seven members. Three are state employees — political appointees working in the Beshear administration.  
To be clear, nothing about this is illegal. The General Assembly could have prohibited people who own production studios and are interested in qualifying for the incentives from serving on the film council but chose not to.

I have no doubt that a number of legislators will find it troubling that two board members are reaping substantial cash awards paid for by their constituents’ tax dollars. But the train has left the station.
The legislation’s sponsor, Sen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, would almost certainly fight against any changes aimed at putting a stop to this kind of thing going forward. And, as chair of the Senate Economic Development Committee, Wheeler controls which bills are heard in his committee.
The best thing taxpayers might hope for is greater scrutiny on new economic development incentives in the 2026 session. At a minimum, the General Assembly should slow down the process, allowing for more input and scrutiny of any proposal. 
The film council legislation could have been brought forward during the interim period and would’ve benefited from transparency and time. Unfortunately, legislators often want to keep the public from knowing too much about anything that would prove unpopular if it was vetted in the open.
Something else caught my eye while reviewing the projects approved by the film council. Paramount Pictures won approval for a film budgeted at $24 million, qualifying for a $7.8 million subsidy.  
The film council’s vision is “to make Kentucky a leading hub for innovative entertainment production.” Paramount’s film will be a good test to see if we can compete against states like Georgia and attract a project from a major studio.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Standing just outside the iron fencing surrounding Virginia’s Capitol in downtown Richmond on Monday, Alexandria resident Gerald Vandendries hoisted a semi-automatic rifle and scanned the crowd gathering for Lobby Day — an annual ritual for gun rights supporters that carried renewed urgency this year.
“We’re hoping to just kind of give Democrats a friendly reminder that this is our right,” Vandendries said. “Our Constitution very specifically says our rights shall not be infringed. They do not have the right in any way, shape or form to dictate to us, the civilian population, what we can or cannot own.”
Monday’s pro-Second Amendment rally, organized by the Virginia Citizens Defense League, drew nearly 1,000 people to the Bell Tower in Capitol Square. 
Attendance was noticeably higher than in recent years, reflecting concerns among gun owners as Democrats once again control both chambers of the General Assembly and the governor’s office — a political alignment many supporters said felt familiar.
In early 2020, when Democrats  gained unified control of state government for the first time in more than two decades, lawmakers enacted sweeping changes to Virginia’s gun laws, including universal background checks, a one-handgun-a-month purchasing limit and a red-flag law allowing courts to temporarily remove firearms from people deemed a danger. 
The legislation, signed into law by then-Gov. Ralph Northam, triggered fierce opposition and drew tens of thousands of gun rights supporters to Capitol Square for Lobby Day that January, though the demonstration remained peaceful.
That history framed much of the message Monday, as speakers and attendees warned that a similar legislative push is again taking shape — and urged supporters to respond not only through rallies but by engaging in elections, local government and the courts.
Several speakers emphasized that even if new restrictions are enacted, gun rights advocates still have avenues to fight back.
Longtime VCDL coordinator Brendan Mooney, who now lives in Idaho, returned to Richmond to address the crowd. He urged attendees to run for or seek appointment to local offices, including school boards and planning commissions.
“There’s a lot of offices in your county that are probably filled with people that got there because they showed up,” Mooney said.
U.S. Rep. John McGuire, R-Goochland, also took the stage, urging supporters to mobilize ahead of this year’s congressional elections.
“We need all hands on deck. We’ve got the midterms coming up,” McGuire said. “I need 10 people to get 10 people to get 10 people to vote. We need your prayers. We need your dollars. We need you out there knocking on the doors now.”

Later Monday afternoon, a counter-protest gathered at the Bell Tower for an annual gun violence prevention rally that doubles as a day of remembrance for Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Friends and family members of gun violence victims joined advocates from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, forming a crowd of a few hundred. 
About 100 attendees wore blue Superman-themed beanie hats honoring Adam Turck, a Richmond-based actor who was shot and killed last summer after intervening in a domestic dispute while walking his dog.
“While we understand and even admire what Adam did, we’re also angry it wasn’t Adam’s job to protect the vulnerable from an act of violence,” said CJ Bergen, a friend of Turck’s who spoke at the rally. “That was the commonwealth’s job.”
The contrast between the two events was stark. While the VCDL rally centered on frustration and resistance to anticipated legislation, the gun safety gathering emphasized remembrance, gratitude and persistence.
According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1,237 Virginians died from gun violence in 2023. Nationwide, the agency reported roughly 48,000 firearm-related deaths in the same period.
Del. Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, who chairs a House Public Safety subcommittee, said at the later rally that addressing gun violence is personal for him after losing a family member.

Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, also attended the afternoon rally and expressed hope that legislation previously vetoed under Youngkin — including a safe storage proposal — could now advance under Gov. Abigail Spanberger.
 Virginia lawmakers set to debate these gun bills this session

Democrats have already filed a broad package of firearm-related legislation this session, signaling that gun policy will again dominate debate.
One proposal would impose an 11% excise tax on retail firearm and ammunition sales, directing the revenue to a state gun violence intervention and prevention fund. 
Other measures would establish standards of responsible conduct for gun manufacturers and dealers, allowing enforcement actions by the attorney general, local prosecutors or individuals harmed by violations.
Several bills focus on domestic violence, tightening firearm relinquishment requirements for people convicted of assault or subject to protective orders by adding age, residency and reporting standards designed to ensure guns are surrendered.
Lawmakers are also revisiting so-called ghost gun legislation, strengthening penalties for manufacturing, selling or possessing undetectable plastic firearms, unserialized guns and unfinished frames or receivers, with updated language reflecting modern security screening technology and delayed effective dates beginning in 2027.
Another proposal would narrow exemptions allowing firearms in Capitol Square and other government buildings, particularly on public college campuses, limiting them to approved academic or institutional activities.
Democrats have also revived an assault weapons ban, introduced by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, a measure supporters argue would reduce mass shootings but which gun rights advocates say would outlaw commonly owned firearms.
Republicans have countered with more limited proposals, including a bill that would exempt women with active protective orders from restrictions on carrying firearms in certain locations and another that would lower fees charged by local law enforcement for processing concealed handgun permit applications.
But their prospects may be limited after losing all three statewide offices and seeing Democrats expand their majority in the House.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Shortly after being sworn in on Saturday, Gov. Abigail Spanberger appointed members to the Boards of Visitors for George Mason University, the University of Virginia, and Virginia Military Institute. She also ordered a review of the higher-ed board confirmation process, which was the center of contention between lawmakers and the previous gubernatorial administration last year.
Spanberger’s actions come as the schools face multiple vacant seats on their governing boards and as the state weathers scrutiny from the federal government over its higher education institutions, which Democratic lawmakers pledged to protect from partisan influence. Spanberger’s nominees, like those of all governors, are subject to confirmation by the General Assembly.
On Saturday, Spanberger directed the secretary of education, in consultation with the secretary of the commonwealth, to submit a report detailing the procedures for board appointments, including member term lengths, reappointments, term start dates for new members, and the evaluation process used by the Virginia Commission on Higher Education Board Appointments.
“Under the current federal administration, Virginia colleges and universities have faced unprecedented challenges from shifts in federal policy to attacks on institutional autonomy and mission,” Spanberger said in Executive Order No. 6. “These pressures underscore the urgent need for the commonwealth to reevaluate how governing boards are appointed, ensuring they are composed of individuals dedicated to upholding the quality, independence, and reputation of our institutions.”
Last year, Democratic lawmakers clashed with Gov. Glenn Youngkin over his nominations to Virginia’s colleges and universities, with the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee rejecting 22 nominations largely because of conflicting ideals over diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. 
Lawmakers also questioned some boards’ decisions to align their policies more closely to ones outlined by the Trump administration and said they threatened Virginia institutions’ autonomy. 
“Strong governance is essential not just for protecting academic excellence, but for ensuring that our colleges and universities continue to prepare students to thrive in an increasingly complex and competitive world,” she wrote.
University of Richmond School of Law professor Carl Tobias interpreted Spanberger’s order as an opportunity to better the appointments process, put forward by a leader mindful of the current political environment.
“The governor is aware and has witnessed … the apparent politicization of the boards especially at UVA and George Mason and so, I think this is her effort to see if there can’t be a better way to have the governor select these people to serve on the boards,” Tobias said, “and hopefully, in that way, improve the process of selection and then improve the governing capabilities of of the boards.”
Tobias also said he is interested in whether the forthcoming report will address staggered terms. In Virginia, some K-12 schools use this method to keep some continuity on the board when the terms of members end before new members’ terms begin.
 New appointees join boards at universities facing federal investigations, racism allegations

Spanberger’s administration on Saturday announced 27 nominees to college boards — 12 to George Mason University, 10 to the University of Virginia and affiliates, and five to the Virginia Military Institute. 
Senate Democrats rejected 22 of Youngkin’s appointees to these boards, sparking a months-long battle that culminated in a Supreme Court appeal. Ultimately, the case became moot after the change in administration.
Former Congressmen Tom Davis, a Republican, and Jim Moran, a Democrat, top the list of Spanberger’s new nominees for George Mason’s Board of Visitors. The institution is under an ongoing U.S. Department of Justice civil rights investigation and faced allegations of racial discrimination in its hiring and admissions policies.
Amid federal investigations, George Mason leaders say negotiations continue with Dept. of Justice

Recently, Charles Stimson, who had been appointed as rector by Youngkin, stepped down, creating an opening on the board.
Last week, Spanberger shook up the University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors by asking several members to resign. She has nominated Carlos Brown, a former vice-rector, as well as Elizabeth Hayes, a UVA alumna and foundation board member. Mike Bisceglia, a business executive who served on Spanberger’s transition team, and Victoria Harker, who was nominated by former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell in 2012, also received nominations from the new governor.
Despite calls from Spanberger and others to suspend its search for a new UVA president, the board moved forward with selecting a leader, a decision leadership told lawmakers they weighed as necessary considering the time required to convene the full board and as they balanced the need for stability and leadership. 
The president search stemmed from a DOJ investigation that spurred former UVA President Jim Ryan’s resignation in June. Ryan wrote in November that Rector Rachel Sheridan and Vice Rector Porter Wilkinson worked with the DOJ and Youngkin’s office to pressure him to resign.
Sheridan neither disputed nor endorsed Ryan’s account at a Senate hearing on Jan. 12; instead, she focused on her own memory of the proceedings and said she and other leaders did what they believed was best for the institution.
Va. senators grill UVA leaders over DOJ deal, leadership search, diversity programs

The DOJ and UVA signed an agreement to suspend five of the seven investigations, which center on the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion policies and allegations of antisemitism on campus. The agreement sparked concerns about federal overreach from Democrats and the UVA community. Two of the investigations have been closed.
Spanberger also nominated former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam to join VMI’s governing board. Northam previously served on the board and completed his term in 2022. 
A 2021 state report noted that “racial and gender disparities exist and that improvement is needed” at VMI, and said racial slurs and jokes are “not uncommon” on campus. The same report found the state’s oldest public military school “lags behind other Virginia institutions of higher education and other military academies in race and gender metrics and diversity efforts.”
Simultaneously, the governing board selected Ret. Maj. Gen. Cedric Wins, the institution’s first Black superintendent, in April 2021. Four years later, Wins was ousted by the governing board composed of mostly Youngkin’s appointees. 
In addition to being a new appointee to VMI’s board, Northam was the first governor in the commonwealth to create a DEI office in the executive branch.
The remaining appointees are a mix of alumni, business and civic leaders.
 Next steps

The review of the boards and commissions’ nominations process, including a report and recommendations, is expected to be submitted to the governor prior to March 18 to inform decision-making and strengthen future appointments.
The House and Senate Privileges and Elections Committees are likely to take up the list of nominations by Feb. 17, the day of crossover when successful legislation is considered by opposite chambers.
Lawmakers will also consider Senate Bill 49, which changes the nomination process by requiring that only fully confirmed individuals may serve in positions requiring General Assembly confirmation. The bill would end the current practice of allowing nominees to begin serving before confirmation, ensuring that only those who have received General Assembly approval hold such positions.

(Photo courtesy of Henrico County Public Schools)If at first you don’t succeed with legislation at the Virginia General Assembly, try, try … wait for a new governor.
That’s the lesson for local officials, educators and state lawmakers when it comes to winning a reliable stream of money for major school construction projects around the commonwealth. It’s been well worth the fight.
Glenn Youngkin, whose term just ended, repeatedly vetoed proposals that would have allowed localities to add a one-cent sales tax earmarked for school construction and major renovations. (I chalk this up to Youngkin, a Republican, being able to say he didn’t raise taxes as governor when he inevitably runs for another electoral office.)
Only the city of Danville and the counties of Charlotte, Gloucester, Halifax, Henry, Mecklenburg, Northampton, Patrick, and Pittsylvania now have – following a voter referendum – the state’s blessing to raise the sales tax for capital school projects, due to the Dillon Rule. Those nine localities gained that ability before Youngkin became governor in 2022.
Localities can raise real-estate tax rates on their own, but many other essential services like public safety and garbage disposal gobble up the money from that source. Officials who want to borrow money for school construction often run into bonding limits in their cities and counties.
Democrat Abigail Spanberger, who was sworn in Saturday as governor, has said she would sign the latest legislation if it passes both chambers this session. The measure, in the state House and Senate, likely will win approval given the current Democratic majorities in both chambers, and because previous versions of the bill garnered bipartisan support.
“The need is only growing” in communities around Virginia, Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, told me. The sales tax option “adds a tool to help localities tackle the issue.”
McPike is the chief sponsor of the Senate bill and has waged a long battle to make it a law. He also knows about the crumbling conditions in so many ancient buildings around Virginia.
He sits on the Assembly’s Commission on School Construction and Modernization. In a report released in 2021, the panel found the total replacement cost for the 1,000-plus buildings then over 50 years old was nearly $25 billion. Many school structures have gotten worse since then.
I’ve written before about some of the woeful conditions that existed: a collapsed 750-pound section of an auditorium ceiling in Norfolk; air ducts that operated so loudly in Portsmouth they competed with the voices of teachers; worn-out HVAC systems; roofs, floors and windows that are deficient in Stafford County.
To Youngkin’s credit, in his first year in office in 2022, the General Assembly approved a historic $1.2 billion investment in school construction, aimed at modernizing facilities and reducing funding disparities among school divisions. The plan had grants and loans.
Loans, of course, have to be repaid. Besides, the needs across Virginia dwarf the amount of money the state has offered.  
Youngkin had previously claimed that, if the sales-tax increase became law, citizens would be on the hook for additional taxes of $1.5 billion annually. But as critics noted, you get to that figure only if voters in every locality approved the measure. Some of the state’s richer localities have enough revenue streams that they wouldn’t need the additional taxes.
That’s why so many communities are desperate to add this option for school construction. Several have publicly supported the one-cent sales tax in recent years – especially those with modest enrollments and limited tax bases.
“Given the magnitude of the issue, it requires a holistic approach to solve it,” said Jeremy Bennett, director of intergovernmental affairs with the Virginia Association of Counties. The group supports the proposal.
Some officials told me they currently must borrow money to complete major projects – which is part of the reason they often delay new construction and sizable renovations.
“It would be vital for us” if the tax proposal passed, said Zebedee Talley Jr., superintendent of the roughly 2,000-student Martinsville City Public Schools. Some sections of their five school buildings date to 1949.
“The kids are deserving of this 1% tax,” he added.
Prince Edward County also is among the places favoring the proposal. The Board of Supervisors in December there cited estimates that the tax could raise $3 million in annual revenue based on recent collections. The division has about 1,850 students.
“No one likes new taxes. I get that,” Donald (Chip) Jones Jr., superintendent of county schools, told me. But “this would allow us to take another revenue source. Anybody who shops or eats in Prince Edward County would contribute.” 
It never made sense that the Assembly granted nine localities this option but denied it elsewhere. Legislators and Spanberger should approve the measure for the rest of the state.
Students, educators and administrators would thank them.

(Photo courtesy Dominion Energy)Construction has resumed on the $11.2 billion offshore wind project by Dominion Energy three weeks after the federal government called for a pause on the work citing national security concerns.
A federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia ordered a preliminary injunction on Friday for Dominion to continue work while the company’s lawsuit challenging the U.S. Department of Interior’s 90 day stop order continues.  
Dominion said in a statement that the company would continue working with the federal government on a solution while work restarts.
CVOW is anticipated to bring on 2.6 gigawatts of energy — enough to power 660,000 homes at a time when the need is critical in the commonwealth. The project is already near completion with the first power expected to come online at the end of the first quarter of this year. That timeline is still on track despite the nearly three week delay in constructing the turbines.
The first of the 176 turbines were delivered by ship to the leasing area Saturday. The foundations for the turbines have already been installed and power will be rolled out on the project as the turbines are built. The entire project is anticipated to be completed by the end of 2026.
Members of Virginia’s congressional delegation applauded the court’s decision to allow the project to move forward and accused the pause of being politically motivated. The Department of the Interior’s stop work order did not specify the national security risks and the defense department reports were classified. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine along with Reps. Bobby Scott (3rd-District) and Jennifer McClellan (4th-District) — all Democrats — released a joint statement.
“(This) ruling is a victory for Virginians, who otherwise would face increased energy costs as a result of the Trump Administration’s shortsighted opposition to clean energy,” the statement read. “We will continue to work to protect this critical and growing industry and to ensure clean energy projects that have met every legal and regulatory requirement can move forward without undue political interference.”
This is not the first federal intervention that has targeted offshore wind projects. Funding for multiple offshore wind related projects was pulled last year including an attempt to cut funds for the Norfolk Offshore Wind Logistics Port, also known as Fairwinds Landing, and the Portsmouth Marine Terminal Offshore Wind Development Project which aided the CVOW project. However, the funding had already been spent for those port upgrades.
Attorneys general in multiple northeastern states have filed lawsuits against the federal government to push back against funding cuts and similar pauses on renewable projects in their states. Virginia Attorney General Jay Jones stated in a release when he took office over the weekend, “My office will fulfill its duty to protect ratepayers and ensure the completion of Virginia’s landmark offshore wind energy project and ensure this federal overreach does not drive up energy costs for Virginians.” 
Jones’ office did not respond immediately when asked if Virginia would officially enter into the lawsuit filed by Dominion.

Brown,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2026/01/20/severe-flu-surge-may-be-dropping-but-not-before-putting-4000-in-the-hospital-killing-14/,"As quickly as it arrived, state data shows Maryland may now be on a downward trend of a “severe” influenza surge, which has already led to 14 deaths and put more than 4,000 in the hospital. But now is not the time to relax our guard, experts say.","A flu shot is administered in this file photo from October 2024. Maryland may be on the downhill side of what experts are calling a ""severe"" flu season, which has already let to 14 deaths and 4,000 hospitalizations, but they warn that the season is far from over. (Photo by Jerry Saslav/U.S. Air Force)As quickly as it arrived, state health data shows that Maryland may now be on a downward trend of a “severe” influenza surge occurring over the winter holidays and early January.
But public health officials say now is not the time for Marylanders to let up on protective measures and public health practices, as the season is not over yet. There have already been 14 flu-related deaths in Maryland so far this year, already doubling last year’s death toll, with weeks left in the current flu season. Last year’s season did not peak until February.
“We’re seeing a bad flu season,” said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
“It’s not too late to get your flu shot…. People who are symptomatic should not go to work or school, they should stay home,” he said. “And then you do all the other things — washing your hands frequently and wearing a mask when you’re around others and have symptoms.”
Early in the flu season, which starts in the late fall, public health officials and health researchers warned that an emerging variant of influenza called subclade K was behind significant surges in flu cases across the world and would have similar impacts in the United States.
The current vaccine formula for the 2025-26 flu season is not as effective against troublesome flu variant, leading to greater transmission this year.
“We are seeing a more severe flu season than we traditionally have,” Benjamin said. “And the vaccine, while certainly effective, is not as great a match as it could have been.”
Benjamin also said that messaging from the Trump administration is stoking confusion around the efficacy and safety of vaccines, leading to reduced vaccination rates.
Moore administration wants health secretary to issue vaccine recommendations, apart from feds

“The federal government really has been asleep at the switch on this,” Benjamin said. “And they recently changed the recommendation for routine flu vaccination for kids. Which is a problem.
“Kids should still get their flu shots,” he said. “And if people have any questions, they should consult with their clinicians.”
Meanwhile, Maryland’s Combined Respiratory Illness Dashboard reports that there had already been 4,202 hospitalizations from late September through last Friday. The total number of hospitalizations during last flu season was more than 8,000, health officials say.
The current flu surge may have peaked during the last week of December, with 1,079 people hospitalized for flu-related reasons. Last year, which was already considered a fairly severe flu season, weekly hospitalization peaked in February at 1,044 people hospitalized for flu.
That said, hospitalizations have quickly dropped, according to state data. During the first week of January, there were 493 people hospitalized.
Andrew Pekosz, professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who researches respiratory illnesses, hopes that the flu surge continues to drop.
“The initial signs that we are seeing here is that it’s a steep flu season, but it seems to be going away as quickly as it came,” Pekosz said. “I caution that every flu season is a little bit different, and there are two influenza viruses – we call them H1N1 and Influenza B virus – that can cause influenza. And it’s not uncommon to see a late-season surge with a different type of influenza.”
But this year’s flu deaths, while high, are still trailing far behind another severe seasonal respiratory illness – COVID-19. In the 2025-26 respiratory illness season, COVID has been responsible for 99 deaths this year. That’s significant because state data shows that current COVID-19 activity is “low” though it is increasing.
“When you look at COVID-19 numbers, there still is a significant danger of severe illness that is sometimes much higher than what we see for influenza,” Pekosz said. “So, while we don’t see as much COVID right now, it’s still a disease that is dangerous, if not maybe a little bit more dangerous, than influenza. Particularly in the high-risk groups.”
Those high-risk groups include people who are over the age of 65 and immunocompromised people.
Pekosz says that for both COVID and the flu, regular hand washing and staying home when sick will help prevent the spread. Antivirals are also available for those who get sick to help protect from severe illness.
He also urged people to get vaccinated to protect themselves from the rest of the respiratory illness season, and wear masks if they are around others while experiencing symptoms.

(Photo by Seksan Mongkhonkhamsao/Getty Images)In the weeks after the assassination of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk last year, online speech became a battleground. Commentators sparred over Kirk’s legacy; supporters of Kirk, urged on by Vice President JD Vance, sought to pressure employers to fire those who mocked or celebrated the event. In many cases, they succeeded. 
The furor was intense, but the techniques were nothing new. For years, the rise of social media has empowered new forms of backlash against both elected leaders and civilians over their political views. 
Now, one New Hampshire lawmaker is pushing to criminalize similar acts of retribution.
A pair of bills introduced by Rep. Terry Roy, a Deerfield Republican and the chairman of the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, would explicitly prohibit people from “doxing” people’s personal information and prevent employers from hiring or firing someone because of political opinions.
The bills would explicitly prevent behavior that has until now been handled through a patchwork of criminal statutes on harassment and stalking. But Roy argues the tense national political environment and unique force of social media necessitate explicit action. 
 “We’re all of a sudden going after people and hurting people and intimidating people — and this is not one party or the other, it’s the entire country — based on their political beliefs and what they express,” Roy said. “These are things that we used to celebrate in this country.” 
But some lawmakers are less sure about the approach, raising questions about the scope of the laws and their potential interpretation. And some outside experts say any new laws should be mindful of freedom of speech considerations. 
“There are problems with doxing,” said Belmont University Associate Professor of Law David Hudson Jr., who has studied anti-doxing laws across the country, in an interview Friday. “There are people that truly do have a nasty intent to cause harm to others. On the other hand, people do have the right to engage in free speech.” 
Roy’s first bill, House Bill 1464, would prevent employers from firing, refusing to hire, barring from employment, or discriminating against a person because of “that person’s political affiliation or opinion.” It would also expand the state law against harassment, which currently prohibits abusive phone calls, insults, taunts, threats, and other behavior. 
The bill would also criminalize harassing, annoying, or alarming another person based on their political affiliation or opinion. The law would apply if the behavior “would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress or fear for their safety, employment, or economic well-being.” If the behavior actually resulted in the victim losing their job or suffering economic harm, the perpetrator could face a Class B felony. 
Some fellow members of the Criminal Justice Committee questioned the definition of “political opinion.” Rep. Buzz Scherr, a Portsmouth Democrat, asked whether the law would protect someone who denied the Holocaust. Roy said he thought that would be a historical belief, not a political one, and thus would not be protected. But he said the scope of the law in individual instances might be a question for courts to decide. 
Roy has also proposed a bill criminalizing “doxing” — the practice of releasing someone’s personal information online to allow people to intimidate or harass them.
House Bill 1367 would define the offense as the “intentional” publication of a person’s identifying information “without their consent” and with the intent to “threaten, intimidate, harass, or cause substantial emotional distress or physical harm” to the person or their family. Doing so would be a Class A misdemeanor, according to the bill, which could lead to up to a year in jail and up to a $2,000 fine. 
The proposed law would carve out exceptions for information obtained from public records and “published for a lawful purpose,” reports of suspected criminal activity, and constitutionally protected speech such as journalism or “commentary on matters of public concern.”
Like many states, New Hampshire prosecutors instead rely on existing criminal statutes to punish harassing behavior. A 2021 review from the Network for Public Health Law found that only a handful of states had statutes specifically criminalizing the act of doxing.
For instance, New Hampshire’s existing stalking law punishes someone who “purposely, knowingly, or recklessly engages in a course of conduct targeted at a specific person which would cause a reasonable person to fear for his or her personal safety.” The law applies to family members, too. And it extends to actions that might not make a reasonable person fearful, but which the perpetrator “knows will place that individual in fear.”
Federal law is also limited. One federal statute prohibits the disclosure of personal information about a grand juror, witness, federal informant, or a public employee assisting in a federal investigation. That information includes phone numbers, addresses, and Social Security numbers. 
Roy said his bill would empower New Hampshire law enforcement to specifically investigate doxing. But other lawmakers again asked questions about scope. Rep. Jennifer Rhodes, a Winchester Republican, asked about the limits of the proposed new law. If someone disclosed another person’s personal information, and did not know it would later be used to harass them, would they be liable, she asked?
“The intent has to be established that the person doing the doxing and the posting — that that was their intent to cause” the harassment, Roy said. He added that the law would not apply to someone posting another’s phone number that they found in the White Pages, unless they were doing so with the intent to threaten or intimidate.
“It’s a relatively high bar that I’m setting here,” Roy continued. “So it’s only going to (affect) the egregious people who basically out themselves because they can’t help themselves.”
Some national groups disagree that doxing should be specifically prohibited. In a 2024 essay for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, the pro-first amendment institution known as FIRE, Hudson argued the laws can interfere with free speech protections for publishing truthful information, as well as protections for “offensive, obnoxious, and even repugnant speech.”
“It’s very dangerous to criminalize any speech that refers to expression that’s in the public domain, or that is in the public record,” he said. “It truly needs to be private information, I think, to have a better chance of being constitutional.”
Hudson said Roy’s anti-doxing bill appears better tailored than other states’ laws, given its exception for public information. “The general pattern on these things is when we start getting laws like this, they tend to get narrower as people learn you can’t (enforce them otherwise),” he said.
The Legislature has tried regulating doxing before; in 2020, a Democratic bill to crack down on cyberbullying, cyberstalking, and doxing, House Bill 1159, was sent to an interim study. 
Now, the effort has returned under a Republican banner. Speaking in favor of the bill. Rep. Henry Giasson, a Goffstown Republican, recounted a personal instance.
In 2025, a person angry about his votes as a lawmaker wrote a social media post calling for his house to be burned down, Giasson said. A second person then listed Giasson’s address in a comment, he said.
“I was concerned about going to vote in the next (session day) because I was concerned about leaving my house,” he said. “A job that pays me $100 a year cost me a security system,” he said, referring to the annual salary for New Hampshire lawmakers. 
“We need to make this illegal,” Giasson said. “We need to make this a backable law.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/doxing-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 05:56:28.118664

“Individual rights are constantly under attack in this country, and Ohioans deserve protections that cannot be taken away by shifting political winds,” said Susan Appel, Volunteer Campaign Manager for Ohio Equal Rights.
“We cannot trust that the government will always do the right thing simply because it should. So we’re doing what Ohioans have always done—we’re taking matters into our own hands.”
Ohio Equal Rights, a grassroots organization, will need to collect about 413,487 signatures from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties — 10% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election — for each amendment in order to get on the ballot. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose will then need to verify the signatures. 
Because they are trying to get two amendments on the ballot, volunteers are trying to circulate both petitions at the same time, said Lis Regula, Ohio Equal Rights Executive Co-Chair. 
Hocking County is the county that is closest to completion with signatures, he said. 
“The narrative that rural Ohio is less concerned about rights at this point does not seem to be the case,” Regula said. 
Ohio Equal Rights originally had one proposed amendment, but the Ohio Ballot Board decided over the summer their proposal actually contained two amendments. They could have challenged the ruling in the Ohio Supreme Court, but decided to move forward with two amendments. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost certified the summary language for both amendments in August. 
“This certification should not be construed as an affirmation of the enforceability, constitutionality, or wisdom of the proposed amendment,” Yost said in both of his Aug. 8 letters. “Those matters are left for a different forum and another day.”
Ohio’s constitution includes a ban on same-sex marriage after 61.7% of Ohio voters approved an amendment in 2004 that says marriage is only between one man and one woman. The United States Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015 through the Obergefell case originating out of Ohio. 
However, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas called on the justices to revisit Obergefell after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.
“Ohioans deserve a Constitution that reflects the will of the people—not outdated laws or political agendas,” Appel said. “These amendments are about protecting families, protecting freedom, and protecting the basic principle that government should not be telling people how to live their lives.” 
The 2026 ballot will also include the governor’s race and other statewide executive offices.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)In a win for President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, a recent court ruling has cleared the way for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to resume using states’ Medicaid data to find people who are in the country illegally.
The case is ongoing. But for now, immigrants — including those who are in the country legally — will have to weigh the benefits of gaining health coverage against the risk that enrolling in Medicaid could make them or their family members easier for ICE to find.
Last summer, 22 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration to block information sharing between ICE and Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program that primarily covers people with low incomes. But at the end of December, a federal judge ruled that ICE can pull some basic Medicaid data to use in its deportation proceedings, including addresses, phone numbers, birth dates and citizenship or immigration status.
The court ruled that in the states that sued, ICE is not allowed to collect information about lawful permanent residents or citizens, nor records about sensitive health information. In the 28 states that didn’t sue, however, the court did not place any limits on the Medicaid information ICE can access.
The U.S. District Court in San Francisco essentially said that government agencies can share some data, including basic identifying information. “That kind of data sharing is clearly authorized by statute,” the decision states.
But the court also ruled that agencies can’t share more sensitive data without adequately explaining why they need it. In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria wrote that ICE and federal Medicaid information-sharing policies were “totally unclear and do not appear to be the product of a coherent decisionmaking process.” He said the states had shown they would “suffer irreparable harm from these vague and likely overbroad” policies.
Worried about surveillance, states enact privacy laws and restrict license plate readers

By law, federal Medicaid money cannot be used to cover people who are in the country illegally.
But in recent years, nearly half of states, including some led by Republicans, have chosen to use their own Medicaid money to extend coverage to certain groups of people, such as children and pregnant women, regardless of immigration status.
Advocates for immigrants and some state officials worry that ICE’s use of Medicaid data will cause widespread fear among immigrant families, keeping them from seeking the health care that states have said they’re eligible to receive. California’s health department recently called the administration’s actions “a grave breach of public trust.”
“States have constantly reassured people that their health care information won’t be used against them, and that’s changed,” said Tanya Broder, senior counsel for health and economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization focused on immigrant rights.
Court filings in the lawsuit illustrate the potential impact of the ruling.
In Chicago, for example, a patient at an Esperanza Health Center delayed her first prenatal visit until her third trimester because she worried enrolling in Medicaid could put her husband at risk of deportation, the clinic reported in a December court filing. By the time she received care, she had complications that could have been addressed with earlier health visits. Another patient refused to apply for Medicaid for her child, a U.S. citizen, because she worried that seeking benefits would allow ICE to locate her.
“The expectation of privacy that we all have when we seek to enroll in a health care program has been compromised,” said Broder.
“Not only undocumented immigrants but people who live in families with immigrants and the broader community are going to feel less comfortable in applying for these health programs, over concerns their information is going to be weaponized against them or their family members.”
An about-face
Several months into Trump’s second term, ICE gained access to the personal data of 79 million Medicaid enrollees as part of its efforts to find people who may be living illegally in the United States.
Data on Medicaid enrollees is routinely exchanged between states and the feds, including to verify eligibility to receive federal funding. But the new agreement marked an about-face from past federal policies of not using such information for immigration enforcement.
The effort is unprecedented at the national level, said Medha Makhlouf, a law professor at Penn State Dickinson Law who specializes in health and immigration.
“Previously the federal government has balanced immigration enforcement interests with the protection of health-related interests,” she said. “Now they’re weighing much more heavily the interests of immigration enforcement.”
That puts the federal government at odds with states that have expanded health coverage as a matter of public health and economic policy, she said. Many states have extended coverage to a wider swath of people on the premise that broader coverage helps prevent the spread of disease, prioritizes preventive care over more costly emergency treatment and reduces economic losses when employees miss work because of illness.
The judge’s order will stand until the case is resolved, as the judge considers what kinds of data can be released for use in immigration enforcement.
ICE courthouse arrests meet resistance from Democratic states

California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, said in a July statement that the Trump administration’s data-sharing move was illegal and “created a culture of fear that will lead to fewer people seeking vital emergency medical care.”
Federal officials say they’re allowed to use lawfully collected information for immigration enforcement purposes.
The Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to requests for comment.
Broder, of the National Immigration Law Center, said it isn’t clear whether the limited information the court has allowed the Department of Homeland Security to use can be cleanly separated from data belonging to citizens and lawful permanent residents. The ruling says that if that basic data can’t be separated from data that’s still protected, Medicaid can’t share it with ICE.
California’s Department of Health Care Services, which administers the state’s Medicaid program, emphasized that concern in a statement updated earlier this month. The department said the feds haven’t provided any information about how they plan to implement the court’s order.
Meanwhile, some states are looking at their options for protecting their Medicaid data. Oregon Health Authority Director Dr. Sejal Hathi called the move to use Medicaid data for immigration enforcement “disappointing, to say the least” in a public board meeting earlier this month.
She said her agency is “committed to doing all that we can within our authority to protect the health privacy of our members” and is working with health providers to “ensure that Oregonians, no matter their background, can continue to seek and receive quick and responsive health care without worrying about the safety of their health information.”
States step up
In recent years, an increasing number of states have used their own money to extend health insurance coverage under their Medicaid programs to some noncitizens, such as people with green cards, refugees and those with temporary protected status.
For example, 14 states and the District of Columbia cover income-eligible children regardless of immigration status, while seven states and the district offer state-funded coverage to some adults with low incomes, regardless of immigration status. Nearly half of states — including a handful of red states — cover income-eligible pregnant women, regardless of their immigration status.











It should be an easy decision for families to accept help, but it’s not easy anymore.


– Medha Makhlouf, a law professor at Penn State Dickinson Law



Makhlouf, of Penn State, directs a legal clinic at her law school where law students assist people who face legal barriers to getting health care and other public benefits. The students have fielded questions from parents — even those who are in the country legally — who have asked if applying for Medicaid for their children, who are U.S. citizens, jeopardizes their own legal status or exposes household members to scrutiny from ICE.
“We see the chilling effects directly,” Makhlouf said. “Folks have many more questions about the risks versus the benefits of applying for government programs. It should be an easy decision for families to accept help, but it’s not easy anymore.”
In the past year, the Trump administration also has ordered states to hand over personal data from sources including voter rolls and food stamps, even as it consolidates information held across federal agencies into a trove of information on people who live in the United States.
In November, a federal judge blocked the IRS from sharing taxpayer information for immigration purposes.

Alander Rocha/Georgia RecorderA surge in data center development has turned Georgia into a national hotspot while raising fresh concerns about the state’s energy landscape and natural resources.
After a massive request from Georgia Power to expand its energy capacity by about 10,000 megawatts due to unprecedented growth driven largely by a rise in data centers and a recent focus on energy affordability, particularly after Democratic successes campaigning on the issue in 2025, lawmakers seem likely to consider legislation that could help regulate the power-hungry, massive facilities.
The 2026 legislative session started last week.

Ratepayer protections
Rome Republican Sen. Chuck Hufstetler. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, a Rome Republican, is renewing his effort on Senate Bill 34, a bill designed to protect residential ratepayers from costs associated with data center infrastructure by prohibiting costs associated with fuel requirements, generation and transmission from being included in general rates.
Hufstetler said in a recent interview that, despite the Public Service Commission passing its own rule to address costs after his bill was introduced last year, his legislation still needs to pass. He said the current rule is insufficient and lacks the permanence of law.
“Their rule has enough loopholes in it to drive a truck through, so we need it codified into law,” Hufstetler said.
The commission’s rule could also be easily bypassed, said Amy Sharma, executive director of Science for Georgia. Sharma said the current PSC framework is “littered with loopholes” that give utilities too much flexibility.
“I do think that something more ironclad from the Georgia General Assembly is definitely needed,” Sharma said in a recent interview.
Data center ‘gold rush’ pits local officials’ hunt for new revenue against residents’ concerns

A central concern for Sharma is what she called vagueness in determining which infrastructure projects are actually for data centers. She pointed to a controversial project in Fayetteville in which high-voltage transmission lines were run through residential yards, and to the mixed messaging that followed about whether it was intended to serve data centers or residential customers.
“Who’s determining if this is needed for a data center, or if they can just be like, ‘Oh, this is grid strengthening,’” Sharma asked.
Tom Krause, a spokesperson for the PSC, said in a statement that the commission “philosophically agree(s) with Sen. Hufstetler’s bill because it mirrors the rule we had already put in place for Georgia Power,” but did not say if the commission supports or opposes the bill.
“Other states have since adopted their versions of the Georgia PSC rule. All the feedback we have gotten from other states is that Georgia’s rule very effectively protects existing ratepayers from data center costs,” Krause said.
Mandating disclosures
While Hufstetler’s bill addresses the costs associated with data centers, House Bill 528, sponsored by Junction City Democratic Rep. Debbie Buckner, focuses on the natural resources these facilities consume. The bipartisan bill would require facilities with a peak demand of 30 megawatts or greater to submit annual public disclosure reports on their energy and water usage.
Rep. Debbie Buckner. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Buckner described the measure as a “communication bill” intended to help local governments understand the impact of developments that often arrive under non-disclosure agreements.
“A lot of times, development authorities are the ones that recruit these kinds of industries, and that information about what they’re going to use is not always fully disclosed to the local governing authorities,” Buckner said.
Sharma said that understanding the current state of natural resources and the overall impact from development is essential for future planning, saying that Georgia currently lacks even a uniform system to track exactly how much power and water these centers use.
“Step one is understanding the problem,” she added. “We don’t know what the situation is on the ground right now.”
The data center industry, however, maintains that data center activity is a net positive for the state’s economy and its energy grid. Khara Boender, director of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, an organization representing the data center industry, said in a statement that the industry is already meeting its obligations and even helping to stabilize costs for other Georgians.
“Across the country, states are recognizing the critical role data centers play in the 21st-century economy and the many benefits they provide to local communities,” Boender said in a statement. “Data centers are committed to being responsible neighbors in the communities where they operate. The industry employs sustainable water practices in its operations and remains committed to paying its full cost of service for the energy it uses.”
Boender pointed to a rule adopted by the Public Service Commission aimed at helping ensure data centers pay for the energy infrastructure they need and Georgia Power’s 3-year rate freeze, saying the industry “will continue working with policymakers to ensure responsible, equitable treatment so Georgia can compete for this investment, supporting jobs, strengthening local tax bases, and positioning the state to lead in a modern, data‑driven economy.”
Re-examining tax incentives
Georgia regulators approve massive power grid expansion to serve data centers

A December audit by the Carl Vinson Institute of Government at the University of Georgia examined the state’s sales and use tax exemption for data centers and concluded that the policy has cost the state at least $1.5 billion in lost revenue since its inception, including nearly $500 million in fiscal year 2025 alone. The audit found that about 70% of data center investment in Georgia would likely have occurred regardless of the tax break because of the state’s existing fiber infrastructure, low risk of natural disasters and utility reliability.
The fiscal impact of the credit is also projected to increase, potentially reaching an annual loss of $800 million for the state by 2030. The audit also concluded that the facilities create relatively few permanent jobs, typically fewer than 50 per center, once operational, after employing about 1,500 employees at peak construction. The audit’s authors estimated that the number of permanent data center jobs in 2025 was just under 1,900.

House Speaker Jon Burns, a Newington Republican, said at a recent press conference that while the credits helped attract the industry, clawing back the tax credits could be considered in the future.
“A lot of people have made decisions based on those tax credits, but that’s a discussion we’ll have on down the road,” Burns said.
The Georgia Assembly passed a bill in 2024 pitched as a pause on the tax credits to allow the state to assess the data centers’ impact on the grid, but it was ultimately vetoed by Gov. Brian Kemp. Now, some lawmakers are gearing up another push to reconsider the tax credit given to data centers.
Lawmakers on Friday introduced two bills to at least in part end the tax credit. Senate Bill 410, sponsored by Newnan Republican Sen. Matt Brass, would allow tax credits for data centers that have already been approved to remain in place, which could address Burns’ concerns. And Senate Bill 408, sponsored by Atlanta Democrat Sen. Nan Orrock, would sunset the tax credit incentive in 2027, five years ahead of the original date. In an interview Friday, Orrock said that her bill is aimed at reeling in the “mega installations” that have massive energy consumption, water usage and a lack of significant job creation.
“The public opinion, the public reaction to the data centers marching into the state, consuming all that electricity, all that water, and all that real estate — they’re vast installations, and oftentimes it plays very inappropriately in terms of their proximity to neighborhoods. It’s going to be a big issue that you’ll see us dealing with in this session,” Orrock said.
Sharma suggested that if the credits remain, they should be repurposed and granted only if a facility minimizes water use or invests in energy-saving technologies.
“You should use tax incentives to incentivize good behavior,” she said.
Rep. Ruwa Romman. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
A statewide moratorium?
Also on Friday, Rep. Ruwa Romman, a Duluth Democrat and 2026 candidate for governor, introduced House Bill 1012, which would place a statewide moratorium on the construction of data centers until February 2027. She said the intent of the bill is to give local governments time to develop local policies that better serve their communities. Romman said the bill has bipartisan support, with Woodstock Republican Rep. Jordan Ridley as a co-signer, and that “people are filling city halls and county meetings, saying ‘we don’t want this.'”
“You can’t really restore the land to what it used to be. And a lot of these counties and cities have been very overwhelmed, trying to figure out what is the best policy,” Romman said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-20 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT official: $70M in health care subsidies coming, despite delays",Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/ct-health-care-subsidies-delay/,Prices quoted by CT's health exchange don’t reflect $70 million in pledged assistance yet — and might not until late March.,"Though Gov. Ned Lamont pledged $70 million in early December to partly offset vanishing federal aid for health insurance, prices quoted by the state’s health exchange don’t reflect that assistance yet — and might not until late March.
A high-ranking state budget official said this weekend that while it could take months to deliver the planned relief, the administration is committed to making this process work.
“It is one of the unfortunate things when you set up a brand-new system,” Claudio Gualtieri, a senior policy advisor at the Office of Policy and Management — Lamont’s chief fiscal and policy planning agency — told the Connecticut Mirror. “We’ve moved with lightning speed to try to get this done.”
Lamont announced Dec. 11 that he would dedicate $70 million in state funds to assist Connecticut families and individuals who collectively lost $295 million in federal tax credits on Jan. 1 that could have been used to help purchase health insurance.
Access Health CT, the state’s health insurance marketplace, typically opens enrollment on Nov. 15 each year, with the goal of getting most consumers into new or renewed plans effective Jan. 1.
The exchange has extended enrollment through Jan. 31 with the goal of getting most customers into policies by Feb. 1, and another extension is possible, Gualtieri said. And its website does include a page that outlines the income categories for customers eligible for the assistance Lamont outlined last month.
Households with yearly income between 100% and 200% of the Federal Poverty Level could receive a state subsidy equal to 100% of expired federal aid.
And those between 400% and 500% of the FPL could receive state assistance equal to half of expiring federal credits.
But the actual prices reflecting those discounts haven’t been added to the system yet. Connecticut also must develop new contracts with the insurance companies that will receive these new state subsidies, though Gualtieri said that process nearly is complete.
Still, could consumers — particularly those not aware of the governor’s plan — opt not to purchase coverage, believing it to be unaffordable?
James Michel, chief executive officer for Access Health CT, declined to be interviewed, but he wrote in a statement that “IT system changes will take a bit longer to implement.”
Michel added that his organization is taking several outreach steps to eliminate confusion.
Tens of thousands of people currently enrolled, or who were enrolled last year, will begin receiving letters or emails soon with information about the new state subsidy plan. Brokers and program counselors also are prepared with this information and will explain it to customers.
Access Health CT “is working as quickly as possible with the state of Connecticut, the Office of Policy and Management and the insurance companies to put these changes in place and to help Connecticut consumers,” Michel added.
Those who already purchased policies for 2026 but subsequently have learned they’re eligible for the governor’s relief plan can amend those applications online, Gualtieri said.
Both new applicants and those filing amendments should check the appropriate box indicating they are seeking financial help and should include their income information, he added. 
To be eligible for the new state assistance, applicants also must enroll in a “Bronze,” “Silver,” or “Gold” coverage plan. They cannot select a minimal coverage, “catastrophic” plan.
And while consumers could pay higher monthly premiums that don’t reflect Lamont’s assistance plan between now and the end of March, state officials are optimistic those customers would be fully reimbursed through premium discounts later in the year.
“Access Health CT, the state and the insurance carriers’ expectation is an individual will be able to fully maximize the savings,” Gualtieri said, though “there may be a lag to make someone whole.”
Connecticut officials have been scrambling for months to respond to massive changes in federal assistance, both to state governments and directly to households.
The GOP-controlled Congress and President Donald Trump agreed last July to eliminate health insurance tax credits and to cut deeply into Medicaid and nutrition assistance to help finance big federal tax cuts aimed chiefly at high-income households.
Though the U.S. House voted earlier this month to revive those credits, no agreement has been reached yet in the Senate.
“We want to do everything we can to … mitigate the pain and confusion that could impact a lot of people,” Lamont said on Dec. 11.
In a November special session, the General Assembly dedicated $500 million from last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion state budget surplus to mitigate federal cutbacks to health care and other human services, granting the governor broad discretion to assign those funds.
Besides tapping $70 million for a one-year plan to offset eliminated tax credits, Lamont also has assigned $168 million from that reserve to bolster nutrition assistance, Planned Parenthood, programs to combat homelessness and other human service initiatives.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/42992454-8AFD-4D81-A9CA-D704DC2E59E9-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-20 05:56:28.118664

(Getty Images)Some state officials and lawmakers are concerned that New Hampshire’s incoming Medicaid premium system may conflict with provisions in Congress’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
In June, New Hampshire lawmakers passed legislation to begin charging premiums to some New Hampshire Medicaid enrollees. Under the new system, enrollees earning 100% or more of the federal poverty level — which is $15,650 for a single person and $26,650 for a family of three, per 2025’s federal standards — will be required to pay a fee in order to receive health coverage through the program starting later this year.
Meanwhile, Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July, a sprawling law that impacts myriad segments of the federal government, including Medicaid, which is run jointly by the state and federal governments. One of the bill’s provisions institutes a cost-sharing program for some Medicaid enrollees in all states. That cost sharing, which goes into effect October 2028, will require enrollees to pay $35 per service for most services (substance use disorder treatment, primary care, institutional long-term care, and others are exempted). But it also caps cost sharing at $35 per service.
In New Hampshire, state officials and lawmakers are concerned the cap would prohibit New Hampshire from charging its premiums.
“And I think there’s open questions about whether you can have both (state premiums and federal cost sharing),” Olivia May, New Hampshire’s director of Medicaid enterprise management, told the Bulletin. “The concern is how to implement them (premiums) while remaining compliant with the cap.”
The state would have until October 2028, when the cap goes into effect, to resolve the issue if it is determined the cap conflicts with the premium system.
May said the state Department of Health and Human Service is asking the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services whether the premiums run afoul of the new law, both because the premiums could exceed the cap and because the department is unsure the state is legally allowed to do both under the law.
“We would need federal permission, basically, to do premiums instead of the cost sharing,” May said. “That’s what we’re seeking CMS guidance on.”
Democrats, who oppose both the state premium system and the federal cost sharing, have used the potential conflict as evidence that the premium system is flawed. Democrats have long opposed the system on grounds it will be a financial burden for low-income families.
“Last spring, the budget enacted premiums for Medicaid before we knew what Congress was going to do,” state Sen. Cindy Rosenwald, of Portsmouth, said at a legislative hearing last week. “The sensible thing for us to do now is to change course and not waste money on a system we can only use for 18 months.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/medicaidkff-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-20 05:56:28.118664

(Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan Advance)The Trump administration notified agencies last Tuesday night that it was suddenly terminating $2 billion — including millions in Ohio — for programs supporting vulnerable people. Amid a powerful backlash, it reversed itself a day later.
The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, Tuesday night sent letters to public and private providers of services to support children’s mental health, prevent teen suicide, help the homeless, assist the addicted, and other services. 
Across the country, workers in those programs were left to wonder how they’d pay their own bills — and to worry what would happen to those who had suddenly lost their help. 
Even with the reversal of the cuts, the chaos further demoralized social-services workers already reeling from deep Republican cuts to Medicaid and federal food assistance that Trump signed last summer, NPR reported.
SAMHSA is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human services. That agency is led by Robert Kennedy Jr., himself a recovering drug addict who has made highly controversial changes to health policy.
The agency’s letter notified providers that it was terminating programs “if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” 
Mental health and substance-abuse recovery programs were among those being cut despite those priorities being in the agency’s name.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The letter said it wanted to promote “innovative programs and interventions that address the rising rates of mental illness and substance abuse conditions, overdose, and suicide and their connections to chronic diseases, homelessness, and other challenges our (n)ation’s communities face.”
It didn’t address the potential harm that eliminating existing programs with no warning might do to people suffering from those problems. 
The Ohio Children’s Alliance partners with local groups to help young adults aging out of foster care, provide behavioral health care to children, support to vulnerable families, and to provide other services. 
Funding for a program to provide extra help to families caring for children with special needs fell under Tuesday’s sudden budget ax.
“Like many charitable nonprofits across the country, we were caught in the rapid changes around SAMHSA’s grant decisions this week,” Children’s Alliance CEO Mecum said in an email Thursday. 
“One of our major initiatives—focused on building respite care capacity for children and families—was directly affected by the uncertainty. We appreciate our state partners at the Department of Behavioral Health, who have been transparent as we await formal federal guidance.” 
He added, “Regardless of the final outcome, this episode highlights how essential it is for federal funding decisions to be stable and predictable so that states and community organizations can provide reliable, sustainable programs that empower families.” 
Asked for comment on Wednesday, the office of Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and the Department of Behavioral Health said they were monitoring the situation and couldn’t comment further. It’s unclear whether DeWine registered any protest with the Trump administration. 
SAMHSA didn’t respond to a request for comment.
NPR reported an immediate, bipartisan backlash to the sudden cuts, which might explain why they were so quickly rescinded.
But while groups working with vulnerable populations might be breathing a sigh of relief, Tuesday’s cuts weren’t the first the Trump administration made to SAMHSA. 
Early last year, an Elon Musk-led group cut 100 workers at the agency, including some helping to run a 988 suicide and crisis hotline. 
Musk’s group also cut resources to fight the opioid crisis in Ohio.
“Overdose and substance misuse prevention has been particularly targeted by the (Musk) cuts, threatening recent progress in the fight to end the opioid epidemic…” Policy Matters Ohio reported in April. 
“SAMSHA staff also provide the expertise, support, and data tracking to manage the State Opioid and Stimulant Response Grant, a key part of Ohio’s response to the opioid crisis.“

More than three dozen child care organizations around the country signed on to a letter urging the federal government to continue funding child care resources like the Child Care Development Block Grant, and bring back funding that was taken from certain states as fraud allegations in Minnesota circulated.
Ohio’s early childhood advocacy group Groundwork Ohio was one of the groups who signed on.
In the letter, the organizations ask the federal Administration for Children and Families to disburse the funding “without further disruption,” and for Congress to “protect and prioritize child care investments” as they continue to debate the next appropriations bill.
The letter said fraud “at any level is unacceptable and takes valuable child care away from eligible families,” and any funding should be used “wisely and as intended.”
“Simultaneously, it is essential that the strong oversight and internal controls already in place to govern these resources are ensuring the funding is being used properly, and that it continues to reach hard-working, eligible families,” according to the letter.
The Minnesota fraud allegations, first made by a right-wing social media influencer, were parroted by the Trump administration, to the point that the administration froze $10 billion in federal child care funds to select states: Minnesota, California, Colorado, Illinois, and New York.
The move caused leaders in other states, including Ohio, to make statements defending their child care systems, the audits and oversight that happen in their systems, and the need for the federal funding to sustain them.
Gov. Mike DeWine joined with Ohio Department of Children and Youth Director Kara Wente to lay out the verification processes used in the state, and fraud investigation methods that can be used, should any legitimate information come to light.
State data showed nearly 20,000 inspections of licensed child care providers in fiscal year 2025.
A federal judge temporarily blocked the funding freeze to the five states on Jan. 9 as a lawsuit continues, but advocates are still nervous about the future of child care funding.
The fraud allegations and funding freeze come as the child care sector in Ohio and nationwide is still strapped with high demand and high worker turnover, combined with low wages and a lack of access in many areas of the country.
Funding freezes related to fraud are just the latest in a heap of financial issues created on the federal level, from Jan. 2025’s fund-freezing executive orders, to congressional Medicaid cuts, and the impact the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history had on Head Start programs and SNAP benefits.
“Any delays in funding would be catastrophic to a sector already in crisis,” said Ali Smith, of Policy Matters Ohio, in a research brief on the situation.

National groups agreed in a Jan. 13 press briefing that the unpredictability and uncertainty of the sector is already causing problems that will ripple out for years to come, and continuing the losses will only further challenge a system in the country that parents rely on to stay in the workforce, and help families thrive.
“Shutting down federal social services and income assistance funding to selected states will hurt babies, and not fraudsters,” said Melissa Boteach, chief policy officer for Zero to Three, a national non-profit early childhood advocacy group.
Phil Fisher, director of the Stanford Center on Early Childhood said the most recent of the annual national surveys the center conducts shows record rates of hardship for those already struggling to afford what they need.
The center’s RAPID Survey Project was started in April 2020 to study the impacts of policy and programs on child care and early childhood education.
Fisher said in Oct. 2025, the research showed the highest rates of “material hardship,” with 60% of families saying they couldn’t afford at least one of their basic needs, which include utilities, food, health care, housing, and child care.
“At present, we’re actually seeing rates that are considerably higher than we ever saw during the pandemic, with more than half of all families consistently reporting that they can’t pay for things,” Fisher said.
As affordability continues to be a problem in America, the child care funding challenges will continue to impact family decisions on what they can and can’t pay for, according to Fisher.
“And yet, we know that policy, from what we saw during the pandemic, can take a big bite out of these issues if we show the self-discipline to really make sure that things happen,” Fisher said.
At the local level, Smith and Policy Matters Ohio argue that the child care crisis could be helped by moving to an enrollment-based payment system, rather than the attendance-based reimbursement that’s currently in place for Ohio’s Publicly Funded Child Care.
The Administration for Children and Families in 2024 pledged to implement a nationwide payment requirement that would be prospective (pre-paid) and enrollment-based. The Ohio General Assembly put $89 million into the state operating budget to implement the federal rules, but that implementation hasn’t happened yet.
Now, the Trump administration has pushed back the deadline to make those changes into 2028.
Since pushing back the deadline, the federal agency has also introduced a new rule that would rescind that requirement, and maintain the attendance-based rules. Public comment on the federal proposal lasts until Feb. 4.
Smith argued taking away the future enrollment-based payments “will continue the crisis in the child care sector” by maintaining financial instability for providers.

(Photo via Maine Dept. of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife)A family of dedicated spin anglers are taking the state to court, arguing that fly fishing only regulations impede their freedom to harvest fish under Maine’s constitutionally protected right to food. 
The lawsuit, filed last month by Joe and Samantha Legendre in Kennebec County Superior Court, marks the second time Maine’s court system will be asked to interpret whether the Right to Food Amendment supersedes the mandate of the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to “preserve, protect, and enhance the inland fisheries and wildlife resources.”
It also marks the second time out-of-state funding has been used to target Fish and Wildlife’s regulatory authority, with lobbyist Jared Borenstein again serving as the lead public spokesperson.
A 2022 lawsuit filed by a different Maine family tried and failed to overturn the state’s centuries-old Sunday hunting ban, arguing the controversial blue law violated the Right to Food Amendment, passed by voters in November 2021.
The latest legal challenge is backed by the International Order of Theodore Roosevelt, a self-described “proactive hunting and conservation foundation” headquartered in Wisconsin. 
Fly fishing only regulations, known throughout the department as FFO, mandate that anglers only use unbaited artificial flies and that those flies be propelled using the weight of the fly line. 
The time and money required for the Legendres and other spin anglers to purchase fly gear and become proficient is an unfair barrier, according to the lawsuit — an impediment Borenstein says prevents Joe, Samantha and their son Justin from accessing some of the most pristine trout waters in the state.
Method-based rules, whether dictating fishing tackle or hunting weaponry, are an oft-deployed tool for regulators tasked with protecting vulnerable species and ecosystems. The earliest FFO regulations were put in place on Yellowstone National Park’s Madison and Firehole Rivers in 1950. Over the last several decades, FFO rules have become more frequently deployed by regulators both out West and here in the East, including in Maine.
Out of Maine’s roughly 6,000 lakes and ponds and over 32,000 miles of rivers and streams, just 200 are listed as fly-fishing-only waters, a small fraction of the state’s total freshwater resource. 
Defenders of the state’s rules say it is no coincidence that those 200 bodies are some of the state’s best trout fishing.
“The reality is, it’s the best fishing because it’s fly fishing only,” said author, registered Maine guide, and avid fly angler Bob Mallard. “These laws were made 40 years ago or more, when there was an abundance of great fishing.”
Now, Mallard said, marginal fishing is the norm in Maine, with the state’s FFO waters serving as some of the best remaining refuge for native brook trout as well as landlocked salmon, the official state fish.
“These regulations were decided by concerned sportsmen that saw cherished resources dwindling away,” Mallard said.
“For a long time in America, we had no regulations,” said Greg Labonte, CEO of Maine Fly Guys, a company focused on education, conservation and affordable fly fishing gear. “And what quickly happened was the extirpation of all kinds of trout populations.”
“Trout are extremely fragile fish,” Labonte said. “If you go below a certain threshold in lakes and rivers, the population simply can’t sustain itself and it collapses.”
Comparing impacts of fly v. spin
The reason fly fishing only rules have helped stave off the destruction of Maine’s brook trout, landlocked salmon and other native species populations is a combination of biological and behavioral science.
Numerous studies have found barbless, single hook flies do less damage to a hooked trout than larger, heavier spin lures, which often feature barbed treble hooks. Part of it is the simple robustness of the tackle, and part of it is the fact that fish tend to attack spin lures, which more easily imitate fleeing bait fish, with more gusto, leading to more deeply set hooks. The research suggests injuries sustained during the catch-and-release process, as well as time spent out of water, are the major drivers of whether a released fish survives.
How Maine’s ‘right to food’ laws clash with tribal food sovereignty

But Mallard, Labonte and others contend that it’s more than the type of interaction that can be studied in a lab. It’s behavior, too.
“In practice, there’s a bigger difference [than in the lab],” Mallard said. “Fly fishing is less impactful than lure fishing. It’s more than just incidental mortality. It’s also a harassment factor.”
“Lure fishermen generally aren’t in the water,” he added. “They’re on the rocks, casting out, bringing fish up onto the rocks and handling them more than they should be.”
Lure fishing isn’t just more burdensome on fish, it’s also simply more efficient.
From a stationary spot on a river bank, the spin angler can rather quickly and easily cast a lure to the majority of places a trout or salmon might be holding. The fly angler, without momentum provided by the heft of an artificial lure, is limited in range and must account for more variables, such as the wind, or the space needed to propel the fly line back and forth while avoiding entanglement in branches and brush. Given these limitations, the fly angler must also change positions to target new spots, sometimes revealing themselves to fish that have evolved a healthy fear of large moving objects.
While an expert fly angler can go toe-to-toe with a competent spin angler, most agree that the average fly angler is much less effective than the average spin angler.










These regulations were decided by concerned sportsmen that saw cherished resources dwindling away.


– Bob Mallard, author and registered Maine guide


Labonte joked that even his young son can cast a spin rod easily — a contrast, he says, to the learning curve many anglers face with fly gear.
“The people who can be a competent rod and reel angler is pretty much everybody,” Labonte said. “Conversely, even people who fly fish are often not very good at it.”
Borenstein, the lobbyist representing the Legendre family, agrees that fly fishing is less efficient, and that’s part of the problem he says.
“You have to have a lot of free time to get good at fly fishing,” Borenstein said.
In other media appearances, Borenstein has emphasized the class dynamics at play, claiming he and the organization he represents would like to see “Maine’s working class have access to all the best waters in Maine.”
The Legendres’ lawsuit describes fly fishing as “a discipline dominated by the wealthy.” It’s a contention that some anglers bristle at, including Mallard, who ran a fly shop in Central Maine for 15-plus years.
“My customers were not wealthy, they were common people, people who worked in the woods, people who worked in the trades,” he said. “This [FFO] is not a matter of class warfare or elitism, it is done for biological reasons.”
Borenstein acknowledged that method-based rules can help relieve pressure on vulnerable fish populations, but argued that fly-fishing-only regulations shouldn’t be used in places where the state is stocking fish and allowing anglers to keep one or more of the fish they catch.
“If these places can sustain a harvest, if you are allowing a take, then the place should not be restricted to fly-fishing-only,” Borenstein said. “You’ve created a resource for them [fly fishers] that’s not available for other people, and we think that’s unjust.”
Asked about the lawsuit, Fisheries and Wildlife said it doesn’t comment on pending litigation. But should the Legendres’ succeed, Borenstein said he expects state regulators to expand catch-and-release-only regulations – rules that prohibit anglers from keeping, or harvesting, any of the fish they catch – in order to keep most of the current FFO rules in place.  
Balancing access with stewardship
The International Order of Theodore Roosevelt mission statement calls for “expanding accessibility” to hunting and fishing, and the group’s flagship policy initiative is advancing right to hunt and fish amendments at the state level. Its materials argue that “hunting is conservation” and that access restrictions weaken America’s conservation funding model.
In addition to invoking the legacy of Teddy Roosevelt, considered by many to be the father of the modern conservation movement, the group’s website features photos of big game hunters and language emphasizing “small government.” In that framing, hunting is presented not only as an expression of personal freedom, but as one of the cultural and economic foundations of conservation itself.
In a follow-up email, Borenstein admitted that the Legendres’ lawsuit could ultimately curtail harvest access, should Fish and Wildlife choose to expand catch-and-release-only regulations, as predicted.

“We would understand that the state was managing the resource in accordance with their mandate contained in the Right to Food Amendment,” he wrote.
Like the national group, the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine, known as SAM, is concerned about outsider groups and animal rights activists influencing how Mainers use and manage their natural resources, pointing to the failed 2014 bear trapping referendum that saw significant outside spending. 
The organization, with a mission to “enhance and preserve Maine’s outdoor heritage,” was intimately involved in the conception of the state’s Right to Food Amendment, and previously pushed for the lifting of Maine’s Sunday hunting ban.
But SAM and its leadership argue the Legendre’s lawsuit runs counter to their own mission.
“This is a direct assault on the management of the resource,” said David Trahan, SAM president and an avid hunter and angler. “We did not want the Right to Food Amendment used in this manner. We see this as a frivolous lawsuit.”
Trahan said he’s concerned efforts to undermine the state’s ability to manage natural resources could embolden ongoing efforts across the country to privatize natural resource access.
“We understand private property rights, but when you start selling the resource, you cross the line in my mind,” Trahan said. “The deer, the moose, the bear, the fish, they belong to all of us. But when you start piecemealing it, saying only the wealthy or large landowners can have access to the resource, that’s unjust. I think that’s what the Right to Food Amendment is trying to prevent.”
Every conservation group has a different set of priorities, but most see access not as primary but as one part of a complex whole – an important need that must be considered and weighed against others’ needs, such as the biological and ecological needs of a healthy trout population.
Maine Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Winthrop), one of the original sponsors and primary driver of the Right to Food Amendment, said no right is absolute and that competing interests must be balanced against one another. But he sees his amendment as a way to reframe the state’s public policy toward seriously addressing the problem of hunger and the cause of food autonomy.
“I see the Right to Food as a way of making the entire state more food self-sufficient,” Hickman said.
Hickman was complimentary of the court’s deliberation and ultimate determination that Maine’s longstanding ban on Sunday hunting did not violate the state constitution. Though Hickman and his colleagues deployed intentionally broad language when writing the amendment, they worked with state regulators to ensure they would protect the state’s ability to effectively manage shared resources.
Hickman doesn’t view the latest lawsuit as helping his cause or honoring its intent, nor does he expect it to be successful.
“I think it is people using this shiny new tool to advance their own agenda,” he said. “Courts see patterns, and I don’t think they’re going to go for it.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/595199729_1265284278966490_5813244131989111576_n-1024x677.jpg,,,2026-01-20 04:57:39.701568

(Photo by Christina Frazier)Ten years ago this January, I began to worry about my upcoming birthday.
It was one of those ages that sits neatly on a ten, and as a computer scientist who pays attention to numbers, that symmetry carried weight. At the same time, I was looking forward to the April publication of my first book, “The Last Wild Places of Kansas: Journeys into Hidden Landscapes,” a project I had been wandering toward long before I ever wrote a word of it.
While I was working on the book, as I began finding places so remarkable I couldn’t believe they were in Kansas, I was at a loss for what to call them. They weren’t wilderness in the academically charged sense of the “Wilderness Act of 1964.” I decided to call them simply “wild places.”
This spawned the question that shaped the book: What do we mean when we call a place wild? The environmental poet Gary Snyder describes it as a place where nature is in charge, a system self-regulated by nature processes. But what does natural even mean as we slog our way into the Anthropocene? Descriptions always fall short. It is better to take someone by the hand and point.
One frigid March night in ye gone days, my friend Alan and I were in a downtown Lawrence bar. We were both graduate students at the University of Kansas. While the Replacements and Husker Du played on the jukebox, we pored over a new publication on the status of greater prairie chickens in Kansas.
Tympanuchus cupido populations had been declining for 50 years. The main reason was habitat loss. More than 95 percent of the tallgrass prairie that the birds rely on had been plowed in the 150 years since Euro-Americans began carving farms from Midwestern grasslands. The Kansas Flint Hills and central Nebraska held the only remaining healthy populations. A time series of maps in the paper animated this shrinking territory at roughly 10-year spans.
As far as we knew, nobody had seen a prairie chicken in Douglas County, where Lawrence is located, for years, but a faint cross hatching in one of the maps teased that prairie chickens had been present in southwest Douglas County, near the hamlets of Worden and Globe, as recently as 20 years earlier.
Could prairie chickens still be hanging on near Lawrence, we wondered? They were the closest thing to free-roaming bison or buffalo wolves left in the eastern prairie. I had never seen a prairie chicken, but Alan grew up in the Flint Hills and knew what to look for. Tortured by the possibility, we left the bar, loaded up my car with camping equipment, and drove off into the night in search of ghosts.
At about 2 in the morning, we stopped beside a small lake to make a fire and rest. We slept on open ground, in bivy sacs instead of a tent. A screech owl purred somewhere in the pines. Occasionally the moon peeked through the clouds in bursts of amber.
Well before first light, a park officer woke us with the beam of his flashlight. We were sleeping in an area off-limits to camping and had to leave. As we packed up our gear, the officer shared his coffee with us. He lived near Globe. We told him our plan, and he said he had heard there were still a few prairie chickens in a pasture near US Highway 56, a two-lane road built on the ruins of the old Santa Fe Trail. Back in the car, we spread out road maps but eventually just began driving mile after mile on dirt roads.
Eventually we reached a large pasture in the general area the officer told us about and parked in a cemetery. A perimeter of section roads, each a mile long, bounded the prairie. We left the car and started hiking along the roads in a quagmire of mud and melting snow.
As the eastern sky began to soften with violet light, we noticed wallows in the prairie, ovals of earth compacted centuries before by buffalo rolling in the mud. They stood out from the taller grasses.
Walking once more, I saw what I thought were a dozen geese coming to land about a quarter mile from us in the pasture. Alan shouted: “Prairie chickens!”
The birds landed in a squat patio of trampled grass. As we watched through field glasses, the males began to drone like Tibetan monks and promenade in an ancient springtime mating ritual. It felt like we were in a dream.
Others had rediscovered these last Douglas County prairie chickens, in the finest remaining large prairie in the county. Three years later, the birds disappeared and today there are no prairie chickens in Douglas County. But on that cold spring morning, their booming incantations and the spooky heebie-jeebies of ghost buffalo made us feel like we’d tumbled into a wormhole connecting the past and a remnant of an ecosystem that we hoped teetered on the brink of renewal, part of the remaining wilderness heritage of the once vast American interior grassland.
There are no maps for these kinds of experiences.
In my travels, I found hundreds of similar places, where the vortex of history blooms in a great collision of nature and folklore. I wrote “The Last Wild Places of Kansas” not as cartographical exercise, but to share a process, a methodology for others to create their own maps. I have continued the work in a second book, “Riverine Dreams: Away to the Glorious and Forgotten Grassland Rivers of America.”
Ten years on, as another birthday approaches, I’ve met hundreds of people who feel as strongly as I do that Kansas wild places are unique in the pantheon of American wilderness. They are as important as redwood groves, Yellowstone geysers, and Rocky Mountain fourteeners.
My fellow Ad Astrians, never let anyone scoff you into believing that Kansas doesn’t have wild places worth fighting for. If you read my books, I hope you will form your own opinions about what does and does not qualify as wild in the Midwest and that you will come to better appreciate the singular natural legacy of places like Kansas.
If you already understand the subtle beauty and biological complexity of one square meter of prairie, or visit a cat run of wild pawpaw groves each September, or have wandered, awe-soaked, in centuries-old pecan groves along the Missouri or Marais des Cygnes rivers, or have consulted Amtrak schedules to see if you could hop out at Cimarron National Grasslands and catch a ride back after three days camping in the sand sage, then you already understand the central premise of my writing: Kansas and the Midwest still have wild places that matter.
For everybody else, read the book and get ready to change the way you feel about Kansas.

The basketball action around the state is ramping up with a little over four weeks until the regular season comes to an end. Here’s a quick recap of what happened in Delaware high school girls basketball between January 12 and January 18. 
 
Concord’s winning streak increases to five games
The Raiders finished a stretch of three straight road games earning victories over Hodgson and Glasgow, last week. Four different Raider players scored in double digits in their win over the Silver Eagles on Tuesday and junior Angelena Gabrysh scored 22 of Concord’s 52 points in its win over the Dragons, Thursday. The Raiders are undefeated against in-state competition this season with their only losses coming against a pair of Pennsylvania schools. Since then, the Raiders are on a five game winning streak scoring 50 or more points in each win. The Raiders next game will be at home against Archmere, Thursday afternoon. 
Sanford continues its strong season with two wins
The Warriors continued their impressive season with a pair of wins against Wilmington Friends and Smyrna, last week. Sanford scored over 60 points in both games continuing a stretch of four straight games scoring 60 or more points. Sophomore Aslyn Merrell led the team in scoring against Friends putting up a game-high 22 points. Junior Asia Adams led the team in their game against Smyrna, scoring 22 points in that win. The Warriors are 9-1 this season with their only loss coming against Bishop Ireton in Virginia. Bishop Ireton is the third ranked school in the state, according to Sports Illustrated. 
Odessa wins two straight continuing its winning streak

The Ducks continued their strong stretch of play with two victories last week defeating St. Andrew’s School and Hodgson. Odessa scored 39 points in a close game against St. Andrew’s that ended with the Ducks winning by four points. Junior Tori Richardson led the team with 14 points in that game and on Thursday, scored a game-high 21 to help Odessa defeat the Silver Eagles. The Ducks haven’t lost in over a month and are on a nine game win streak that began December 6, 2025. 
Tatnall bolsters record with undefeated week
The Hornets defeated Newark High School and Tower Hill last week, increasing their record to 7-4 this season. Tatnall’s defense played well in both games, holding its opponents to a combined 52 points across the two games. The Hornets held the Yellow Jackets under double digit points in each quarter of their win Tuesday and allowed only two points in the second quarter in their win against the Hillers, Thursday. Senior Jordan Cooke and Freshman Eva Baxter paced the offense scoring a combined 64 points across the two games. Tatnall will play twice this week taking on St. Georges on the road and Brandywine at home.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_fki0hwfki0hwfki0.png,,,2026-01-20 00:57:36.698503

His office has been an active participant with other Democratic attorneys general challenging the Trump administration. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)To Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D), it’s about stopping the “chaos coming from Washington” since President Donald Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, 2025.
Brown was reflecting last week on his part in the push by 23 attorneys general from Democratic states and the District of Columbia to challenge Trump administration policies in court. Planning for the lawsuits began after Trump’s election in 2024 and were guided by policies outlined in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, which served as a policy roadmap for the administration and the Republican-controlled Congress.
The first suit was filed the day after Trump’s swearing-in, challenging his attempt to end birthright citizenship. All told, the attorneys general have filed 71 lawsuits against the administration over the past year, with more to come this year.
Brown’s office has led, co-led or joined in more than 100 legal actions – taking part in 51 of the lawsuits, with the rest in briefs filed in support of others’ suits.
“I told Marylanders that I believe that chaos was coming from Washington, and it was putting Marylanders and Americans at risk. Well, chaos came,” Brown said.
Democratic state attorneys general will continue to lead opposition to Trump in new year

In the state’s legal fight against the Trump administration, Brown said during a press briefing the office’s Federal Accountability Unit has helped to preserve billions of dollars in federal funding toward transportation, education, environmental protection and other services.
Maryland sued to restore nearly $400 million for the AmeriCorps program (nearly $15 million in Maryland), to stop the administration from laying off thousands of employees with the federal Department of Health and Human Services and to ensure funding is provided for residents to receive gender-affirming care.
Brown’s office led in an amicus brief filed in October that called the Trump administration’s attempted deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois “unlawful, unconstitutional and undemocratic.” Two months later, the U.S. Supreme Court kept an injunction in place to block from the administration from deploying the troops.
Federal judges did grant preliminary injunctions on several cases filed by the attorneys general, such as the administration refusing to release about $5 billion under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, and not allowing the Trump administration to block Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood and other health care providers.
Various lawsuits are pending, including a claim by the state and Prince George’s County in November against the administration’s plans to cancel an apporved plan to move the FBI headquarters to Greenbelt, and instead keep the agency in downtown Washington, D.C.
Maryland is leading a lawsuit filed three weeks ago against the U.S. Department of Education. That suit, joined by attorneys general from D.C. and North Carolina, challenges what it calls “unlawful cuts” to congressionally approved funding for Full Service Community School (FSCS) programs.
“We protected rights such as Maryland’s voting rights, whereby executive order that the administration attempted to restrict voting rights in Maryland and around the country,” he said. “So, these are issues and matters that … Marylanders care about.
One year of Donald Trump: Alarms sound over relentless expansion of presidential powers

“I would invite anyone to point to a specific action we brought [against the administration] … when we’re bringing back and saving hundreds of millions of dollars for Marylanders,” he said.
Lawsuits against an administration by the party out of power are hardly new: Republican attorneys general filed scores of suits against President Joe Biden (D), with Texas alone filing more than 100.
But not everyone in Maryland agrees the legal battles are necessary or advisable now, especially with the state facing a $1.5 billion budget deficit.
“There’s been numerous lawsuits over the Trump administration on what I think, on many subject matters that the overwhelming majority of Marylanders agree with,” said Del. Matt Morgan (R-St. Mary’s), chair of the seven-member House Freedom Caucus. “Years ago, politicians used to put the country ahead of their own ambitions and political parties. I’m not sure that’s happening in Maryland.”
But House Majority Leader David Moon (D-Montgomery) said Brown and other attorneys general are just doing what they have to do to challenge the Trump administration’s actions.
“I feel really bad for the attorney general because I’m not sure if he knew he was signing up when he ran for office to be a debt collector,” Moon said. “The attorney general is in court simply trying to get the administration, which is tasked with enforcing the laws, to follow the laws.”

In a world that feels louder, faster, and more divided by the day, it’s easy to believe that meaningful change requires massive effort, deep pockets, or heroic sacrifice. It doesn’t.

Ken Engelman

Sometimes, all it takes is 30 minutes.

Thirty minutes a week.
Thirty minutes a month.
Even thirty minutes once a quarter.

That small window of time – often lost to scrolling, streaming, or worrying – can become one of the most powerful investments you’ll ever make when given to a local community nonprofit.
The value to the community: Small help, real impact
Local nonprofits are the quiet backbone of our communities. They feed families, support veterans, protect animals, mentor students, care for seniors, and respond when government systems fall short. Yet most operate with limited budgets, skeletal staff, and volunteers who are already stretched thin.
When someone offers even a short, consistent block of time, it matters more than most people realize.
Thirty minutes might mean:

Updating a flyer or social post that brings in new donors
Making a few thank-you calls that strengthen donor relationships
Helping organize supplies, files, or schedules
Sharing professional insight that saves a nonprofit time and money

These organizations don’t need perfection – they need participation. And when communities step up, local nonprofits become stronger, more sustainable, and more responsive to real needs.
The value to the volunteer: Purpose you can feel
Volunteering isn’t charity – it’s connection. It’s pro bono services that helps everyone. People who give their time often discover something unexpected: they receive just as much as they give.
Volunteering restores perspective. It reminds us that our skills matter beyond paychecks and job titles. It reconnects us to neighbors we may never have met. It provides a sense of purpose that no algorithm can deliver.
For professionals especially, volunteering offers:

A renewed sense of meaning and fulfillment
Opportunities to use talents in creative, human-centered ways
Reduced stress and increased mental well-being
Stronger ties to the community they live in – not just pass through

In a culture that measures success by income and status, volunteering reframes success as contribution. That shift is powerful.
The value to humanity: Sharing what made us successful
Every skill you used to build your career – communication, organization, leadership, creativity, strategy – was shaped with the help of others: teachers, mentors, communities, opportunities.
Volunteering is how we pay that forward.
When people share their hard-earned abilities with local nonprofits, something profound happens: experience becomes legacy. Knowledge becomes service. Success becomes shared.
Caring about local nonprofits isn’t just about helping “others.” It’s about reinforcing the idea that we belong to one another. That progress isn’t individual. That humanity works best when compassion and contribution are normalized – not exceptional.
Thirty minutes won’t fix everything. But multiplied across neighborhoods, towns, and cities, it creates momentum. And momentum creates change.
The ask is simple:

You don’t need to overhaul your life.
You don’t need to volunteer forever.
You don’t need to do it all.

Just show up – briefly, consistently, and sincerely. Give a little time. Share what you know. Care where you live.
Because when people choose to give back – even in small ways – communities grow stronger, individuals grow more fulfilled, and humanity becomes a little more human.

Cochrane,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/20/childcare-is-essential-infrastructure-for-connecticut/,There is no functioning economy without childcare. It is a load-bearing support for the workforce.,"YWCA Hartford Region is deeply concerned by recent federal actions that delay or disrupt childcare funding. 
Childcare is not a discretionary service — it is essential infrastructure, as critical to family and economic stability as housing or transportation. When childcare funding is weakened, families, employers and Connecticut’s economy feel the impact immediately. 
These effects are not abstract; they are visible every day in the lives of working parents who rely on safe, stable, and affordable care to maintain employment.
What happened?
Recently, federal officials announced new documentation and verification requirements connected to the Child Care and Development Fund  (CCDF). Although described as a procedural review, the practical effect is that states must complete additional verification steps before federal dollars are released. This has resulted in funding freezes or delayed reimbursements in several states. More than $10 billion affecting California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and New York was held pending intensified review. 
A federal judge has since temporarily paused parts of this freeze, allowing funding to resume in those five states while the legal challenges move forward.
Connecticut was not on the list of states where funds were withheld, reflecting strong state compliance and robust fiscal oversight. At this time, Connecticut has not experienced documented, statewide childcare service disruptions. However, the uncertainty itself is destabilizing. Because reimbursements rely in part on federal systems and timelines, any national delay or administrative slowdown can affect Connecticut providers’ confidence and planning.
Childcare is essential infrastructure
Even without active disruption, the instability created by federal shifts is harmful. Childcare providers operate on thin margins; delayed payments, added paperwork, and unclear timelines place strain on their capacity to maintain staffing ratios, program hours, and classroom safety. Connecticut’s families depend on federal and state partnership functioning smoothly. Sudden changes — even if temporary — place pressure on the entire system.
Federal instability threatens local stability
While Connecticut remains operational, the heightened federal verification requirements have created anxiety among providers who worry about future delays. The state must continue monitoring federal guidance closely, as disruptions in neighboring states can spill into Connecticut through regional workforce ties. Many Connecticut families work across state lines, and staffing shortages or closures in bordering communities could affect Connecticut’s labor force, particularly in health care, transportation, retail, and service industries.
Childcare is the load-bearing support of the economy
Connecticut has been proactive in strengthening childcare infrastructure. State actions include targeted operational grants during the pandemic, expansions in Care 4 Kids eligibility, and ongoing Office of Early Childhood (OEC) reforms to streamline oversight and improve access. Additionally, the state has developed workforce initiatives such as scholarships, credentialing supports, and compensation enhancements to stabilize the educator pipeline. These efforts have positioned Connecticut ahead of many states — but they remain vulnerable to federal funding uncertainty, which directly impacts reimbursements and long-term financial planning.
Connecticut’s working families depend on childcare 
In the Greater Hartford region, many families already live on the edge of economic insecurity. Single parents, women, families of color, immigrant households, and ALICE families — Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed — rely on stable childcare to stay employed in jobs that rarely offer flexibility or remote options. 
Research shows that childcare upholds parental employment. For example, Head Start participation has been tied to children meeting age-appropriate expectations and parents gaining or maintaining employment, with 90% of surveyed families reporting that the program helped them keep or get a job. When childcare is disrupted, consequences are proven to extend beyond individual families. 
Workforce and economic impact 
Childcare is a cornerstone of workforce participation. According to economic analyses by Bipartisan Policy Center, gaps in childcare access could cost the U.S. economy up to $329 billion over the next decade in lost productivity, labor shortages, and reduced income.  
Even before this latest funding threat, childcare was already stretching many families’ budgets. National data show that childcare can cost families as much as 10–13% of household income, making it one of the largest household expenses after housing. Meanwhile, the childcare workforce — overwhelmingly women — is paid significantly less than the average worker, and many childcare workers themselves struggle to make ends meet.  
In Connecticut specifically, these economic pressures are real. When childcare fails as a support structure, workforce participation suffers. Employers experience higher absenteeism and turnover; productivity decreases, and business operations — especially in health care, hospitality, and manufacturing — face instability. Childcare is not a support service — it is a workforce necessity. 
Children lose too 
Children are directly impacted by childcare instability. Early childhood is a critical period of brain development. Staffing shortages, reduced classroom hours, or turnover can disrupt routines and affect cognitive, social, and emotional growth. Even perceived instability can raise stress levels for both children and families.
We must act now
Although Connecticut is not experiencing active disruption today, the national uncertainty surrounding childcare funding is a clear warning sign. Federal instability can quickly impact state systems, and Connecticut’s progress must be protected. Ensuring uninterrupted funding, maintaining state-level investments, and safeguarding access for every family are urgent priorities.
A stable childcare system is the foundation of a strong and equitable future for Connecticut.

Western civilization is littered with rulers who convinced themselves that “there is only one person who is master in this empire and I am not going to tolerate any other” – Wilhelm II, Germany’s Kaiser from 1888 to 1918. 
Numerous wildly misguided European kings and one Fuhrer led their countries into war with neighboring states throughout the 19th and 20th centuries – with disastrous consequences: Napoleon III initiated the Franco-Prussian war, which was a disaster for France. Kaiser Wilhem II of Germany banked his country’s future on its ability to overpower France in 1914.  We all know how that turned out. Spoiler Alert: it was not good – and definitely not to the benefit of Germany.
So, when a U.S. president says something both belligerent and strange to the leader of a European NATO nation, one is inclined to take more than passing note: 
“Considering your country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped eight wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace…” President Donald Trump, to the Prime Minister of Norway, Sunday, January 18.
 If this is a threat, it is hardly veiled. Wars between European trading partners began on grounds of considerably less during the 19th and 20th centuries.
Whatever his motivations, beyond being obsessed with militarism, Kaiser Wilhem II was more than a tad myopic in waging war against the neighboring nation of France. In 1914 France “was a top destination for German exports”  –  ahead of Russia. France contributed to Germany’s balance of trade, positively and significantly. The Kaiser’s Germany was the direct beneficiary of multiple millions of dollars in trade with France, which plummeted, disastrously, after Wilhelm’s declaration of war in August of 1914, after declaring war on Russia three days earlier.
Presently, there can be no disagreement over the fact that the European Union is a “premier trading partner for the U.S.; it is the largest trading bloc and a top destination for export of U.S. goods and services – exceeding $1.5 trillion in trade.” The reality that the EU has “a massive, deeply integrated economic relationship with the U.S., underpinning millions of jobs” cannot be denied. The EU trade deficit with the U.S. can hardly be grounds for grievance worthy of unsettling the peace between Europe and the U.S. –  unless the U.S. State Department and the Department of Commerce are totally inept. (Quotes from an AI overview.)
Where is the fly in the ointment that could undermine peace between two longstanding compatible nations? Alain Berset, secretary general of the Council on Europe says, “I did not think that I would ever have to write about the possibility of the United States taking military action against a member state (of NATO). Yet, here we are. President Trump has vowed to make Greenland – a semiautonomous territory of Denmark….part of the United States, and that he will do so ‘the easy way’ or “the hard way.”
Wake up people!
This fight is not necessary. This fight is more than dangerous; this fight would be deadly. To be over a perceived slight? What’s not ridiculous about that?
A rather extraordinary similarity of personality characteristics exists between Germany’s Kaiser of 1914 and America’s president of 2026. Based on English historian M.J. Carter’s consequential historic analysis, none are flattering. As Carter says, “You don’t really want a narcissist in control of global power.” (See The New Yorker, reprint, “What Happens When A Bad-Tempered Distractable Doofus Runs an Empire.” By Miranda Carter,  June 6, 2018.

There was plenty of action on the court throughout the state last week including an undefeated week from St. Georges, Smyrna and others. Here is a quick recap of what happened in Delaware high school boys basketball between January 12 and January 18.
 
Hawks bounce back with two win week
St. Georges entered last week following a pair of losses the week prior, but it bounced back with road victories over Appoquinimink and Burlington City High School — located in New Jersey. The Hawks scored 21 points in the fourth quarter against the Jaguars and 21 in the second quarter against the Burlington Blue Devils in their pair of wins. Senior Joshua Obiora led the team in scoring both games with 18 and 15 points respectively. Obiora is the team’s leading scorer this season with 216 total points through 11 games.
Smyrna earns big win in undefeated week
The Eagles started their week with a big matchup against Cape Henlopen. The Vikings entered the game as Delaware Online’s third ranked team in the state with eight wins and only one loss. Smyrna delivered Cape Henlopen’s second loss of the season beating the Vikings, 49-43, Tuesday night. Seniors Chase Sullivan and Logan Shaw paced the Eagle’s offense with a combined 30 points and the Smyrna defense played well holding Cape Henlopen to its lowest point total this season. The Eagles finished their week with a double-digit victory over Caesar Rodney to bring their season record to 7-3.
Concord starts five game homestand with a pair of wins
The Raiders won two of their three games this week beginning their five game homestand with wins over Hodgson and Glasgow. Four Concord players scored in double figures in its first win against Hodgson on Tuesday and a 21-point performance by senior Carlin Hollis helped Concord to its third win in a row, Thursday. The Raiders one loss this week came against Appoquinimink on Saturday, disrupting the Raiders’ win streak. The Raiders begin this week with an 8-3 record and will conclude their homestand with games against Christiana and John Dickinson.
Dover increases its winning streak to eight
The Senators won all three of their games this week by double figures staying undefeated in the month of January. Dover scored 90 points in its first game of the week with over half of those points coming in the second half. The Senators scored 29 points in the second quarter of their win over Sussex Tech and in their final game of the week senior Tarrance Williams led all players with 21 points, defeating Howard. Dover’s only loss this season happened in mid December against Bergen Catholic in New Jersey — the 77th ranked program in the country by MaxPreps. Since then, the Senators have scored 90 or more points twice and won by double digits all but twice.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_kr8773kr8773kr87.png,,,2026-01-19 23:56:46.278677
