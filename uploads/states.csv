Collaborative processes structured to include the needs and expertise of citizens can lead to sustainable and effective outcomes when paired with clear policy goals, firm process constraints, and effective leadership. 
The post Abundance with input: We can build housing and energy systems without ignoring community concerns appeared first on CommonWealth Be[...]","In their new book Abundance, Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson make the case that laws and regulations designed to block the government and private sector from doing bad things have now made it far too expensive to do good things, especially to build what we need the most: housing and clean energy. They put the challenge starkly: “Changing the processes that make building and inventing so hard now requires confrontations with whether the systems liberals have built really reflect the ends they’ve sought.”   As public policy mediators, we share Klein and Thompson’s view that there is a need to reform unbalanced approaches to public input, requirements for many agencies to sign off on the same project with a myriad of permits, and legal challenges that focus on procedure rather than impacts.  But in our view, Klein and Thompson don’t spend enough time highlighting strategies that can work. We have been working for more than 30 years in Massachusetts and across the United States with government agencies, communities, and interest groups. We know that collaborative processes structured to include the concerns, needs, and expertise of citizens can lead to wise, sustainable, and effective outcomes when paired with clear policy goals, firm process constraints, and effective leadership.   Massachusetts is a case in point. It’s a blue state with plenty of obstacles to development. But state and local government, housing and energy developers, and environmental and community advocates have begun serious work on reforms that can make it easier to build while still providing for meaningful community input. Experience here offers three practical lessons on getting to more abundant housing and energy supply while ensuring public input and influence.  The first is to set clear goals in legislation and agency policy, and to constrain the opportunity for excessive procedural and legal challenges to those goals. Elected officials must set the “what” — what change in the world we are trying to make — while communities should have a say in the “how” — how that change can come about. In Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker and the Legislature passed the MBTA Communities Act, with quantified multi-family zoning requirements for each of the 177 communities served by the greater Boston transit system. The act also allowed each community flexibility to decide where to put multi-family zoning districts, enabling residents to draw on their local knowledge and experience to help shape the future of their community. Most of the designated MBTA communities have responded positively, using their planning boards, town meetings, and citizen input to find good sites and avoid places where multifamily housing would not be viable or desired. At the same time, the courts have made it clear that creating these multi-family districts is a mandate that all towns must meet.      The Healey Administration has gone further with two recent multi-stakeholder groups. The Housing Advisory Council has just produced the first statewide housing plan with a target of 220,000 new units of housing by 2035, allocated across the state. The Unlocking Housing Production Commission (whose work our organization facilitated) has recommended additional, state-wide reforms of zoning and other regulations to remove barriers to housing development, while still giving local communities a significant voice in deciding where those developments are sited.  Both of these bodies represented diverse interests in housing and started with the premise that the need for more housing is not up for debate. Both have the backing of the governor. Now the Legislature needs to decide how much further it wants to go in addressing state and local barriers to housing production while continuing to allow communities a role in development decisions.  The second step is to reduce the number of veto points in new infrastructure development while providing better public processes. For many years, the conventional wisdom was to engage local communities early and deeply in big development projects, aiming to meet as many of their concerns as possible, and then secure the necessary public permits. That approach has reached a dead-end in the face of overwhelming, politicized “not-in-my-backyard” opposition to almost any new infrastructure project in most of the country. Instead, legislators can consolidate infrastructure permitting at the state level, provide funding for meaningful community input, and then decide on larger scale projects – without an option for opponents to mount legal challenges on issues already decided by the permitting authority. These authorities must still take and respond to input from individual citizens, local governments, interest groups, and state agencies. But they should ultimately make decisions on issues that the stakeholders cannot resolve.   Michigan, Illinois, Massachusetts, and other states are heading in this direction with new state energy siting legislation. While this approach does constrain avenues for participation, it provides far more clarity, predictability, and accountability than the typically convoluted multi-stage, multi-agency infrastructure permitting process. With a more consolidated siting approach, citizens actually know where to go to make their case, instead of chasing multiple authorities and jurisdictions.  In Massachusetts, the Commission on Energy Infrastructure Siting and Permitting brought together representatives from state agencies, municipalities, electric utilities, agriculture, labor, and others to hammer out an approach to energy siting that would expedite and streamline permitting. The approach would also constrain the ability of local interests to stop energy projects of a certain scale that would benefit the commonwealth as a whole, while providing more technical and financial support for affected parties to participate in the process. The commission’s recommendations, themselves a collaborative effort, led to the 2024 Climate Bill codifying these recommendations in law.  Finally, we must avoid over-representing those whose main goal is to oppose new housing or infrastructure efforts. We can do so by making sure that those who have something to gain also have a place at the table and support for being there. For example, we can find ways to give voice to young people who are not currently residents of a community but would wish to live there; those who grew up in the community but were displaced by high housing costs; or the policemen, teachers, and firemen unable to live in the communities where they work. We can bring representatives of these groups into local advisory bodies, to balance the voices of those who resist change to their neighborhoods. To enable working families to participate, we can use social media, surveys, games, hands-on tools, and online meetings. When we need in-person meetings, we can hold them where these residents live and provide childcare stipends or on-site day care for parents.    As Massachusetts’ experience has begun to show, communities and states across the country can overcome the obstacles making life less affordable and restricting opportunities for change. As mediators and facilitators, we have seen that people can and will get creative to solve problems if they’re given a mandate to work together and help to seek common ground. Diverse groups representing all the key interests at stake can produce broadly supported recommendations for the elected leaders who will make final decisions. We now need to apply that insight systematically in our municipalities and our state — and across the country — to create the abundant housing and energy supplies we need for the next generation.   David Fairman and Patrick Field are senior mediators with Consensus Building Institute, a nonprofit that helps leaders solve complex problems.The post Abundance with input: We can build housing and energy systems without ignoring community concerns appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Development.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-27 05:57:34.235030

Some lawmakers quibble with calling that a cut, and there’s a logic to their argument. The additional funding was a one-time supplement, approved in 2023, while the state was flush with federal COVID relief dollars. Now, some argue, the economy is back on its feet, there are plenty of job openings, and it’s time for the state to dial back assistance programs.
But the people maintaining that safety net say the need is greater than it’s ever been.
Gardens, pantries and food banks: How Ohio tries to keep pace with hunger

There’s an echo of the 2024 presidential election in that disconnect. The economy might look good on paper, but many are still struggling to make ends meet. Housing costs are rising. Wages aren’t keeping up. Inflation rates have come down. Grocery bills haven’t.
People who work in the food assistance system regularly point out that when money is tight, food is the first place families cut back. You can’t reduce your rent or electric bills, but you might be able to save some money leaning on canned goods or mac and cheese.
The state budget maintains food banks’ core appropriation of about $24.5 million year. But Mike Hochron from the Mid-Ohio Food Collective explained that’s the same funding they received in 2019. Back then his organization fed about 50,000 families in Franklin County each month. Now it’s 100,000.
“I don’t know how you’re supposed to serve twice as many people with the same amount of resources,” he said. “It means being really creative. It means being really efficient, and it also means figuring out how to make do with less.”

Faith Fellowship in Circleville 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
For a couple hours every Saturday, Pastor Susan Roark’s Faith Fellowship congregation runs a pop-up up food panty in an empty lot on Circleville’s Court Street. This is the front line of Ohio’s food assistance system. In communities all over the state, pantries provide households with groceries like meat, dairy, fruits, vegetables and grains.
An hour before they open, workers are lugging banana crates packed with food from a box truck and trailer. They’ve got a ring of folding tables steadily filling up with canned goods, produce and bread. A man pulls out a step stool to hang a large blue Faith Fellowship sign on the truck. Nearby a few workers are laying out used clothing.
There’s already a line of people waiting.
At one end of the lot there’s an old motor home. Inside Cecilia Seckman and Mary Martin are filling Styrofoam trays with food. This sets the Faith Fellowship pantry apart from many others. Visitors can pick up the typical panty basket, but they can also leave with a hot meal.
“We’re gonna have ham and potatoes, green beans, rolls, and cake,” Seckman says as she dips food out of a couple of crock pots. Tomorrow is Easter; a man from another church donated 17 hams.


The germ of Faith Fellowship’s pantry came from one of their congregants, William Michael Brown. He worked with a street ministry in nearby Chillicothe and wanted to bring the idea to Circleville.
“The Bible says you’re supposed to feed and clothe the needy,” Brown said matter of factly. “We all do what we’re supposed to do, it’s all trying to follow the Bible.”
He’s proud of how their effort has grown — “It’s just been a bloom,” he said — but the demand worries him a bit, too.

“I don’t know if it’s the wages, if it’s the cost of living, or what it is,” Brown said.
“They come from everywhere,” he added. “It’s a need.”
Eric and Ashley Wharton made the drive from Chillicothe. Eric said the pantry gives them some breathing room amid the rising cost of living. “I’m door dashing, but I’m barely surviving,” he said. Getting a hot meal on top of the pantry basket makes a huge impact for them.
“If you put the price on that, that’s $8-10 if we’re gonna go buy it,” he said. “So, I mean, that puts $10 back in my pocket that I can use for gas or use for something that’s a little bit more important.”
Talisha Myers said the extra meals take a lot of work off her plate.
“I have five kids, and then plus my father-in-law lives with us, so it’s like, it’s really hard,” she said. “We don’t qualify for food stamps or anything, because they say me and my husband make too much together.”
Roark’s congregation is only about 50 people, but they serve a couple hundred pantry visitors and give out about 250 meals each week. After only half an hour they’d given out 125 meals.
“I think the need is greater than our capacity to meet that,” she acknowledged. “And there are other organizations in town that are working to meet different needs, but all of us together still can’t meet the need.”

The Mid-Ohio Food Collective
Standing behind organizations like Faith Fellowship are the food banks. While pantries operate like a storefront, food banks serve as distribution centers. Ohio has regional 12 food banks, and with a 20-county footprint, the Mid-Ohio Food Collective is the largest.
“We’re sending food every day out as far as Steubenville — a three hour drive each direction,” Hochran explained. “So, whether that’s as far north as Marion, down south to Chillicothe and all the way out east to the West Virginia border, that’s all our territory.”
Mid-Ohio supplies food to more than 600 support organizations from a warehouse in Grove City. The building is the size of three football fields; think Costco but crawling with forklifts instead of shoppers looking for samples. Fully stocked, the warehouse can hold roughly 7 million pounds of food. But the goal, Hochran explained, is to move that stock out rapidly — sometimes the same day it arrives.
“Almost two thirds of what we distribute at Mid-Ohio is fresh food,” he said. To get produce out the door they proactively send out fresh food alongside the items pantries have ordered.
“We know you’re going to serve a couple hundred families today, that’s going to be about —make up a number — four pallets worth of fresh produce,” Hochran said. “We’ll pick from what we have and send out a good variety of it, because we don’t want this stuff sitting in our cooler for three days.”
A case in point is stacked up five feet tall on about twenty pallets.

“This is a good example of perfectly wholesome, delicious cabbage,” Ohio Association of Food Banks Executive Director Joree Novotny explained. “But it’s not going to have a retail market. It’s not up to size, up to snuff, in terms of what a retail customer is looking for and what our traditional grocers are looking for.”
That cabbage was purchased through an Ohio program helping farmers recoup their investment in produce that doesn’t quite make the grade for your local grocery store.
“So rather than see this all end up staying out in the fields or end up in a landfill, we’re able to bring it in at pennies on the pound,” Novotny added.
As she’s explaining that, forklifts are filing up and carrying away one pallet after another. While Hochron shows off a large display where they track delivery trucks in real time, more forklifts start unloading a new shipment. This time it’s pallets of yellow squash.

Statewide perspective
Novotny explains food banks around Ohio are getting squeezed in multiple ways. More people need their help, support programs are holding steady or rolling back and the money food banks have doesn’t go as far as it once did.
She points to seniors as an example. The Ohio Association of Food Banks estimates 70,000 Ohio seniors receive the minimum $23 benefit through SNAP, the federal food stamps program. But during the pandemic, the minimum SNAP benefit was more than $200. So where do they turn to make up the difference?
“Well, a good example, if you look right over here on these shelves,” Novotny said, “these are some of the raw products that come directly from the USDA for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which is a small but mighty program that food banks operate in Ohio.”
The problem is funding for that program has remained flat. The cost of groceries certainly has not.
“It’s a good sort of microcosm,” Novotny said, “of how that purchasing power that’s been more limited means less food for vulnerable people.”
Novotny said they’re seeing similar funding challenges at the state level. To explain their current circumstances, she reaches all the way back to the Great Recession. It took food banks a decade to settle at a “new normal” in 2019. At that point, she said, they were delivering take home groceries to about 850,000 times a quarter.
“Since then, putting all increases in need aside, if we were serving the same number of people today, we have significantly reduced purchasing power,” Novotny said. She noted the consumer price index for food has risen almost 24% in the last four years, and they’re not serving 850,000 households a quarter — they’re serving 1.4 million.
“We need some help,” she said, “to help adjust to that inflationary pressure.”
In their budget request, the Ohio Association of Food Banks asked for an inflation supplement of about $5 million on top of the $24.5 million they’ve been receiving since 2019. That request fell on deaf ears.
In February, House Finance chair, state Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, predicted that his caucus would keep historical funding in the budget but “maintaining a level of funding that we had at the worst economic times we’ve had is just probably not gonna be what we do.” That prediction held.
Novotny insisted “we will always have some food to provide,” but with government support at the state and federal level standing still while prices rise and more families seek out support, something’s got to give.
“We are already lightening the load significantly to each person who’s coming to us for help,” she said.

Nearly 1 in 5 Connecticut lawmakers are also landlords, far outweighing the number of renters in the General Assembly, according to an analysis by The Connecticut Mirror of the most recent financial disclosure reports.
While the majority of the 187 members of the state’s Legislature are property owners, the CT Mirror’s review shows that 35, or 18.7% of lawmakers, are also landlords. In the United States, closer to 7% of the population are landlords.
There are only 19 legislators who reported not owning any property, meaning they most likely rent. About a third of Connecticut residents are tenants.
The most recently available forms reflect last year’s legislature, although there are only 22 freshman lawmakers this session. Only four of those who left were landlords, and two were renters. It’s not clear which of the freshmen lawmakers are landlords because their financial disclosure reports won’t be available until May.

The landlord-tenant relationship has been one of the chief concerns of the Housing Committee for the past several legislative sessions. In 2023, adjustments that expanded renter protections accounted for most of the Democrats’ signature housing bill.
The issues have also drawn some of the fiercest debate and most-attended public hearings of the past three legislative sessions, with meetings lasting into early mornings. 
While lawmakers hold mixed opinions about whether and to what degree a legislator’s status as a landlord affects public policy, lawmakers from both parties have cited their experiences as landlords during discussion on bills that would alter the landlord-tenant relationship. 
Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, a landlord and Housing Committee ranking member, said he considers his experience an asset.
“I’ve got significant amount of experience in this,” Sampson said. “My interest is completely on the side of making good public policy. I’m not picking a winner or loser in this situation. I want all sides to prevail, and that, in my view, is less government intervention.”
Sampson has historically opposed bills that are supported by tenant union members and tenants rights advocates, such as bills to reform eviction law and cap annual rent increases. 
Meanwhile, some lawmakers said their colleagues who are landlords are prioritizing personal income over Connecticut residents.
“I was taken back. I just didn’t think there would be so many landlords voting on issues, voting to put profits over people,” said Housing Committee co-chair Sen. Martha Marx, D-New London. Marx said she asked to be put on the committee because, in her experience as a home health care worker, she’s seen many people living in bad conditions.
“When I voted on housing issues, it’s through their lens. Those are the people that I’m thinking of,” she said, adding that she doesn’t believe many of her colleagues are thinking of renters.
Lawmakers rarely mention their experiences as renters during public debate on housing bills, according to longtime members of the Housing Committee and advocates.

Over the past couple of years, lawmakers have considered bills that would cap annual rent increases and another that would largely end no-fault evictions, which haven’t passed.
The evictions bill is back this session and passed the Housing Committee last month. It would end evictions that typically occur at the end of a lease for apartments with five or more units, if the renter has lived at the property for at least a year.
There is disagreement about whether this bill — and its amendments — is an example of pro-tenant or pro-landlord sentiment on the committee.
Committee ranking member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe, pointed to the bill as a piece of pro-tenant legislation that has gotten attention over measures he thinks would be beneficial to landlords.
Marx said the fact that the bill also includes a caveat requiring a tenant to live at a property for a year before the protections kick in is an example of legislation that’s been watered down by landlords in the legislature.
Other lawmakers said the portions of the state’s tax code that benefit homeowners and a bill that would make it easier for police to quickly remove people from rental properties if they don’t have a lease are other examples of policies that prioritize property owners over renters. 
“If your financial interest depends on squeezing more rent out of the citizens of our state, then you’re not voting the way I think you should be voting,” Marx said. “Housing is a right. Everybody deserves stable housing, and everybody deserves a home.”
Financial disclosure forms
Lawmakers who own rental properties span across parties and chambers. Fourteen are Republicans, and 21 are Democrats. Nine are in the Senate, and 26 are in the House.
About 40% reported owning more than one property, including vacation homes and timeshares.
CT Mirror’s analysis classifies lawmakers who reported owning multiple properties and collecting rental income as landlords. CT Mirror also included lawmakers who report rental income, but their properties were listed as rentals on sites such as Zillow, and one who is a property manager.
Lawmakers who are involved in the real estate business or those who serve as attorneys for landlords are not classified as landlords in the CT Mirror analysis.
Lawmakers also varied widely in how thoroughly they filled out their financial disclosure forms. Some listed companies that own property but didn’t include the property on their forms, while others listed out each property and the income from that property individually. This could mean that there are rental properties that went unlisted on financial disclosure forms, in which case the CT Mirror’s analysis is an undercount.
Several lawmakers listed multiple properties in Connecticut but didn’t list rental income.

Advocates say the disproportionate number of landlords often means that tenants’ experiences don’t hold as much weight in public debate.
“There are so many conversations I’ve had with legislators where the first frame of reference is, ‘What I’m hearing from landlords,’ or, ‘My friend is a landlord,’ or ‘Myself as a landlord.’ Just anecdotally, that discourse is so often defaulting to a landlord perspective,” said Luke Melonakos-Harrison, vice president of the Connecticut Tenants Union.
State ethics rules require that lawmakers abstain from voting only if the legislation would disproportionately affect their business, compared to others in the industry. But advocates say public policy, particularly in the area of rental properties, is still shaped by the professional and financial goals of members of the General Assembly.
Advocacy groups that represent landlords and several legislators said they don’t think the impact is so obvious. They say state policy is usually more pro-tenant and that housing providers are best equipped as experts to craft policy.
The majority of landlords were also homeowners. For many legislators, it’s been years since they were last renters, and they might not know what it’s like to be a renter in today’s economy, advocates said.
“Much of the work that tenants have to do participating in the process is just providing a basic education of what it’s like to be a tenant,” Melonakos-Harrison said.

Shaped by personal experience
Connecticut has a part-time legislature, meaning the elected officials are typically either retired or hold other jobs because lawmakers only meet for part of the year. Several said they can’t help but be shaped by their experiences, and those experiences help color policy debate.
“I would love to see those folks take a little bit more of a step back and understand it from a holistic perspective,” said Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport. Felipe is one of few renters in the legislature. “But when you have personal experience, that personal experience is going to weigh in, and I think it might have overweighed itself in certain situations, but it’s kind of the name of the game.”
Felipe added that a lawmaker’s salary at a base of $40,000 annually makes it hard for people who work hourly jobs or don’t have passive income to run for office. He added that he hopes lawmakers understand that access to passive income isn’t the typical experience for Connecticut residents.
“You cannot support a family, or let alone yourself, on a legislator’s salary without some other income, whether it’s pension, retirement benefits, or a second job,” he said. “You have to figure out a way to pay the bills.”
Scott said he’d talked to many landlords in the legislature who have said they think the legislation is “going against them.”

Former Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Geoff Luxenberg, D-Manchester, said separating from personal experience often comes down to research. Lawmakers are barraged with sometimes hundreds of bills to consider and often don’t have time to research all the topics, he said.
That means they often lean on their own experiences, he said.
“When you’re lacking expertise in a certain area, as an elected official, I think there’s a tendency to rely on your values, your experiences, your life experiences, to shape how you might view a particular issue,” he said. “And that’s probably where it seeps in the most.” 
Luxenberg reported owning close to 60 properties — the most in the legislature — and draws rental income from most of them. He said his policy views have been shaped by the number of people who come to him desperate for housing.
“It’s like a harrowing front row seat to the most painful part of the housing crisis,” he said.
He added that it can go the other way — that lawmakers shape policy without an understanding of what it’s like to be a landlord. But he thinks it more frequently disadvantages tenants.
“It has been my experience, frequently, that policies that specifically help renters economically face a hurdle in the legislature, and I suspect part of that hurdle is a disconnect between the lived experience of legislators and the lived experience of extremely large number of people in Connecticut who are struggling to pay their rent,” he said.

Legislation proposed
Luxenberg said he’s proposed policy that would offer tax relief to renters, and the attempts have been shut down. Most housing-related tax relief programs for residents aim to encourage homeownership in an effort to help people build wealth.
But researchers have said this approach essentially rewards wealth, offering tax breaks on mortgage interest to people who are able to afford to purchase a home, while people who rent are left without much aid.
“All the benefits in the tax codes at every level of government are for ownership,” he said. “All the things we discuss expanding or increasing are about real estate ownership.”
Lawmakers and advocates also pointed to a bill from Rep. Minnie Gonzalez, D-Hartford, as one driven by her experience as a landlord. In her latest available financial disclosure form, Gonzalez, who is on the Housing Committee, reported that she owns three properties, including her own home.
She earned rental income from one, and her husband earned it from the other. During committee meetings, she’s talked frequently of an experience she described as a “nightmare.”
Gonzalez said she was driving by her rental home one night and saw that the lights were on, even though no one was supposed to be living there. She stopped by and found someone had moved in. 
It’s not clear why the person believed they had a right to be in the property, but Gonzalez says the person was squatting. It took her four hours to resolve it, and she’s since gotten out of the landlord business.
So, this session, she proposed a bill that would allow police to remove squatters from homes without going through a court eviction process.
“They’re not going to grow up, those people, they’re not going to have any responsibility at all,” Gonzalez said during a public hearing. “And it’s very hard to say, maybe very difficult for you to accept. Squatters are illegal, and it should be criminal, and they should be sent to jail.”
But attorneys, other Democrats and tenants rights advocates have raised concerns that the bill would violate due process. Some tenants say they have oral agreements with their landlords but nothing in writing, and it would be hard for police to decide who is telling the truth.
Rafie Podolsky, a longtime housing attorney, said the legal question isn’t whether breaking into a property is illegal but what to do in more complicated situations in which tenants don’t have a lease.
“There are also circumstances where people are living there on oral leases and do not have a single piece of paper that show that they are there with the landlord’s consent,” said Podolsky, during a public hearing. “And if a landlord says to the police, ‘I want this person out. I never agreed to this. Tell them to show you anything in writing,’ they may have nothing to show you, but it doesn’t resolve the question.”
The bill passed the Housing Committee 12-6, with several Democrats voting against it.
In response to the opposition, Gonzalez said in an interview that tenants should make sure they get written leases.
“We have to stop babysitting people,” she said in an interview. “We have to do what we’re supposed to do. Yes, let’s help people, if we have the way to help people, but allowing other people to go out there and take advantage? I don’t think it’s right.”

Eviction reform
Gonzalez also voted against the no-fault eviction bill and said in an interview that she doesn’t believe that there is a housing crisis. She often sees signs advertising apartments for rent or homes for sale, she said.
Data and research have shown that Connecticut lacks tens of thousands of units of housing that are affordable and available to its lowest-income renters and that thousands more across different socioeconomic lines are paying more than a third of their income to housing costs. Construction of new homes and availability of houses to purchase have also slowed.
Gonzalez said she thinks the issue isn’t related to supply but to rents that are too high. She favors capping annual rent increases, she said.
Marx said the no-fault eviction bill is an example of one that’s been watered down because of the perspective of landlords in the legislature.
“They watered down the affordable housing measures,” she said. “They watered down the tenants rights bills so that they don’t have any teeth, so that we really pass bills that just don’t do anything for the tenants, and life is just going to get harder for our lower and middle class citizens.”
The bill now includes a provision that says the protections against no-fault evictions don’t kick in until the tenant has lived at the property for a year. Marx says they should begin the moment a renter moves into a property.
The bill has been controversial, even within the Democratic party and among lawmakers who aren’t landlords.

Rep. Larry Butler, D-Waterbury, a former Housing Committee chair and current member, said he doesn’t think it’s a balanced bill that considers the needs of landlords. He voted against it in committee.
“The legislation is like using a hammer instead of using a scalpel, in my opinion,” Butler said. Butler owns his home but didn’t report any rental income or ownership of other properties. He said he was surprised to learn that so many of his colleagues are landlords because he hears about it infrequently.
Republicans have objected to the bill, saying it would violate landlords’ rights and could push people to leave the rental business, taking homes off the market. Sampson said in an interview that he’d heard from friends who are also landlords who say they’re considering giving up their business.
“It’s concerning to me that the Connecticut legislature and the majority seems to think that they have a right to tell people what to do with property that they own, that they worked for and paid for,” Sampson said.
Tenant rights advocates say the concerns are overblown and that the bill is simply an extension of rights that already exist for seniors and people with disabilities. Other states have similar laws and haven’t seen significant harms to their rental market, they say.
Melonakos-Harrison said he thinks the concerns of landlords are considered with more seriousness because lawmakers tend to interact more frequently with landlords than renters.
“People’s perspective on housing is very much shaped through the social networks that they’re in, by people who own property and make money off of property,” he said. “It’s rare to hear any lawmakers speak about the opposite perspective. Renter issues tend to be talked about as more of something that people are not personally familiar with in any meaningful way.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0108_SR_SessionFirstDay_402-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-27 05:00:55.227860

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Find yourself a patch of land away from city lights just about anywhere in Kansas, and you will hear them. Sit down on a good rock and wrap yourself in the cold and dark, especially during a new moon in winter, and they will eventually begin to yip, yowl and yap. Their cries will grow in intensity until you might think yourself surrounded, subject to imminent attack, although you are likely as safe on the prairie as in your own bed.
What just sent a thrill down your spine is the cacophonous song of the coyote. These “song dogs” are among nature’s best survivors, an adaptable omnivore that has been with us since at least the last ice age. They are present in every state except Hawaii, are blamed for killing farm livestock and snacking on suburban house pets, and have been the target of unsuccessful eradication attempts for the past 200 years.
The latest campaign in the war on coyotes came April 24, when the Kansas Wildlife and Parks Commission voted 5-2 to extend the night-vision hunting season from the current three months to seven.
During the meeting, held at Fall River in southeast Kansas, the commissioners acknowledged various conflicts over extending the season but declined a request from Wildlife and Parks secretary Chris Kennedy for more time to study the coyote problem.
The new season would be Sept. 1 to March 31, excluding some firearm deer seasons. Currently, the season is limited to January, February and March. The extended season would not take effect until after the new regulation passes statutory and legal review and is officially adopted.
Night vision hunters typically spend thousands of dollars in rifles, scopes, and thermal optics. Their gear resembles tactical military gear, and that may be part of the appeal. We’ll get to this Zero Dark Coyote pretend combat presently, just as we will recount the story of a coyote named Rattlesnake.
In places like Kansas, where the myth of the frontier seethes just below the cultural surface, the coyote is not just a predator but a living symbol of the dichotomous desire to both hold the wild and to tame it. For First Peoples, Coyote often represents the Trickster, the entity who alternately brings creation and chaos. For ranchers, the coyote is a profit-eating pest to be eliminated by any means available. For romantics, the animal represents wildness, rebellion and cunning survival. We see ourselves in the clever and grinning countenance of these nocturnal ramblers.
Coyotes have been watchers on many of my outdoor adventures, but my best memory comes from a night some years ago sleeping on a sandbar on the Arkansas River far below Wichita. I had been kayaking the river for a book project and, retiring to my tent after miles of paddling, the coyote yips seemed like the voices of old friends. Their night song spanned the centuries, at least in my imagination, to a time before the plow broke the plains.
From the moment white settlers came to Kansas, coyotes were targeted for extinction because of real and suspected depredations. Rabbits and mice are the primary foods for coyotes, but just about anything can become a meal of opportunity — garbage, crops, livestock, the occasional toy poodle. Coyotes generally don’t attack human beings, although when cornered or trapped they can be dangerous, just as any wild animal can.
In 1916, the Kansas Supreme Court took up the case of a coyote in a Wichita zoo that bit a child.
Four-year-old Bessie Hibbard had been taken by her parents to the zoo at Riverside Park, where she put her hands in a cage containing a coyote on display. The animal bit and scratched her hand and arm. Bessie’s father sued the city for negligence. The state Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling and found in favor of the city, saying officers and agents of the city were not liable for damages while performing official duties. A dissenting justice, Judson West, said the coyote cage was a “most malignant and excuseless” nuisance which afforded zoological specimens the opportunity to “dine upon the children” of visitors.
I’m with West.
For decades, beginning around 1900, the state attempted to eradicate coyotes by poison, firearms and paying bounties on their hides. When I was a kid, I remember some of my friends getting $2 per pair of coyote ears, paid by the county. I was a hunter in my youth, and always in need of money, but I never shot a coyote. I have since given up hunting, believing it immoral to kill wild things for money or sport. Your results may vary.
Perhaps the biggest change in the state’s approach to coyote management was the result of one man, F. Robert Henderson, a specialist who worked 27 years for the Kansas State Cooperative Extension Service. Henderson, hired in 1968, educated livestock producers across the state about the myths and realities of coyote predation.
“Not all coyotes kill livestock,” Henderson said in his memoir, published in 2016. “It is a learned thing on the part of the coyote. … I found out that generally ranchers hate coyotes.”
He also learned that most people who set out to kill coyotes end up thinking that killing indiscriminately is not the answer. Instead, you have to eliminate those animals that have learned to kill livestock, and the best way to do that is by trapping.
In the 1970s, Henderson set out to make an educational movie about coyote control. Lacking funds, he used a Super 8 movie camera and wrote his own script. The star of the film was Rattlesnake, a coyote the Henderson family had raised as a pet — something, the author cautioned, that “is not a good idea for you or the coyote.”
Rattlesnake became the film’s star because he would attack livestock when given the opportunity, a drama Henderson created with the help of a local rancher. It all seems a little bloody now, but I think the point of the staged scene was to show Rattlesnake running away when a pickup truck approached. When the film was shown, Henderson recalled, “Kids would first feel sorry for the calf, then cheer when the coyote got away.”
Like the kids, Henderson’s sympathy was with the coyote.
“Wild animals do get into situations where they create losses and cause people to have loss and worry,” Henderson wrote. “This is true, always has been and probably always will be.”
The actual number of cases is likely far fewer than generally believed.
Henderson’s memoir, appropriately called “Coyotes Go to Heaven,” is a sprawling and folksy account of his life, and that of his wife, Karen, from 1933 to 2016. Henderson recounts, among other things, hunting with Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden and the influence of environmental ethicist Aldo Leopold on wildlife conservation.
Henderson died in 2024. He was 91.
I was thinking about Henderson as I reviewed the video stream of the Wildlife and Parks Commission voting to extend the night vision hunting season for coyotes. I hadn’t known much about Henderson until a few weeks ago, when a friend suggested I check out his work. I’m glad I did, because Henderson seemed like somebody I could have been friends with.
I don’t presume to know what Henderson would have thought about the expanded coyote season, but I can tell you I find it disturbing. The kit — night scopes, thermal optics, and typically an AR-15 style rifle — seem more suited to urban warfare than recreational hunting. I suspect that playing war is the point for some. I don’t mean this mockingly, but hunting requires skills that are also useful in combat, something that novelist, soldier, and big-game hunter Ernest Hemingway knew well. But for all his faults, Hemingway did his hunting in the light.
Coyotes are officially treated as a non-game species, according to the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks, but they are “regulated and managed” as furbearers. As a non-game species, they can be hunted during the day year-round, and there is no bag limit. In 2021, a three-month night vision hunting period was introduced, ending March 31. With a hunting license and a special $2.50 permit, hunters can use artificial light and thermal imaging equipment.
This year, 7,310 night vision permits were issued, according to Laura Rose Clawson, chief of public affairs for the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks.
“Coyotes are an important recreational species in Kansas,” Clawson said in an email. “About 30,000 hunters spend about 200,000 days total hunting coyotes in the state. Most of this is the result of traditional (non-night-vision) hunters and methods.”
Clawson said there were alternatives to hunting for controlling losses to predation, including penning livestock at night, removing carrion, having guard animals, and fencing.
“However, coyotes do sometimes prey on livestock,” she said, “and in those cases, lethal removal of the offending animal is often the most effective solution.”
About 4% of cattle losses and 11% of lamb losses were due to coyotes, she said, citing figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Trapping is an option, but that is also lethal. The animals are destroyed after being trapped because relocation isn’t viable.
In public hearings on the night-vision season held last month in El Dorado, Junction City and Hays, a total of 58 individuals attended. Thirty-eight were in favor of an expanded coyote night-vision season, Clawson said, while 10 were opposed. Another 10 were neutral or did not complete the survey.
“I’m concerned I don’t have as much biological data on the coyote population as I’d like to have,” Kennedy, the Wildlife and Parks secretary, said during Thursday’s meeting. He also wanted “to make sure we’re not hunting any wildlife population in the state to extinction.”
Kennedy suggested postponing the vote on extending the night vision season, but the commission proceeded. There was, however, some concern. One member expressed worry about how hunting is perceived by the public. Another acknowledged that previously a wildlife biologist had told the commission that even a yearlong season would likely have no effect on the coyote population. The discussion preceding the vote was largely about conflicts with other hunting seasons, the added burden on game wardens and other law enforcement, the best month to hunt coyotes (January) and the importance of night-vision coyote hunting to the state economy.
Guided night-vision hunts are a big business in Kansas, with operators charging up to $1,800 per night. The coyotes are lured in by electronic rabbit distress calls. The operators, of course, claim they are doing landowners a favor by killing the animals.
Perhaps. But I doubt the accelerated killing of coyotes will do much to deter livestock predation because it doesn’t target the offending animals. The animals killed by the night-vision hunters are being promised rabbit for dinner, not lamb. You don’t kill all dogs because some have learned how to get into the chicken coop.
Nature is indeed “red in tooth and claw,” as Alfred, Lord Tennyson poetically observed in 1849. But we shouldn’t be. Night-vision coyote hunting seems offensive in the same way as buffalo slaughters in the 1870s or rabbit clubbing during the Great Depression.
There must be a better way to control coyotes than shooting them.
Coyotes have expanded their range and tripled their numbers since the 1980s, but it’s not the fault of the animals. Humans created the opportunity by destroying habitat and by reducing the coyote’s chief rival, the wolf. The harder coyotes are hunted, either in calling contests like the ones held in Kismet or by night-vision seasons, the larger their litters.
They have learned to exploit our trash, our livestock, and the habitats we create. They have become America’s most successful predator because we have helped them become so.
As author Dan Flores noted in 2016’s “Coyote America: A Natural and Supernatural History,” their strength is their uncanny adaptability.
“In one of the myriad ways humans and coyotes eerily mimic one another,” Flores wrote, “like us coyotes are a cosmopolitan species, able to live in a remarkable range of habitats.”
The current night-vision campaign to control the coyote population, like past hunting efforts, is doomed to fail. It may provide recreation for those who like military-grade kit, but it is ultimately a pseudo war against ourselves.
I’m rooting for the coyotes.

Enjoying the view from the train is one of the perks of being car-free, and some parts of the ride are especially beautiful.


Traveling along the coast, especially east of New Haven (on Shore Line East or Amtrak) the water views are spectacular.  Even on the wetlands side, there’s often wildlife to be seen… egrets, ospreys and such.
Crossing the soon-to-be-replaced, 125-year-old Walk Bridge in Norwalk, there’s a nice view out to the water or into downtown South Norwalk.  Westport’s Saugatuck River Bridge (known as Saga) is also a delight.  Same thing in Greenwich crossing the Mianus River where a glimpse to the north brings back memories of the collapse of the I-95 bridge in 1983 that took three lives.
But my favorite part of the ride into New York City on Metro-North is between Portchester and New Rochelle, that nine-mile straight section of track that engineers call “The Raceway.” Running right alongside I-95, the trains used to have a speed limit of 80 mph, and they’d do it.
Is there anything more satisfying than whipping past drivers on that busy interstate, showing them that the train is a faster choice?  I’ve even been known to wave as we hurtle past.
Just south of Westchester County, as trains enter The Bronx (near Woodlawn), is where the New Haven and Harlem lines converge, complete with a soaring rail overpass.  Again, a great view for a railfan such as myself. 
Another favorite of mine is crossing the Harlem River into Manhattan as the trains traverse the Park Avenue Bridge.  There’s a great view of the city skyline and brief views down the avenues.
Some stations are also memorable, even when passed at high speed.  Just who was Greens Farms named after?  And just why doesn’t the stylish new Fairfield Metro station have a waiting room?  But special mention goes to Milford where the usual advertising posters on the platform have been replaced with huge photos of the beautiful town itself.  Nice promotion.
As nice as those views are, there’s much of the ride which is far less scenic.
The seemingly bombed out factories of Bridgeport hold such memories… and promise.  And Portchester’s old Lifesaver building, complete with its terracotta candies as ornamentation, remind us of the whimsy of architecture.
Railroads are built around business, and looking into the backside of industrial sites along the right of way ain’t exactly pretty.  Even in corporate office buildings, it’s funny how landlords spend so much adorning their street-facing façade but forget that thousands see only the backs of the building, covered with graffiti and neglect.
And much of the trackside, strewn with debris, old rail ties and rusting equipment, could also use some TLC.

(Ryan Berry for Washington State Standard)Unemployment benefits for striking workers are close to becoming law in Washington after a compromise proposal cleared the state House and Senate. 
Striking workers could expect to receive the benefits for up to six weeks under the legislation.
Senate Bill 5041 now awaits a signature from Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, who has remained silent on his position on the bill. 
Earlier in the legislative session, the Senate approved a 12-week limit on striking workers receiving the benefits, and the House approved four weeks. Typically, unemployment insurance is available for up to 26 weeks a year. 
Both chambers approved the six-week proposal on Friday.
“I think really the only changes to this are that it went to six weeks and I think it’s a nice compromise,” said the bill’s prime sponsor, Sen. Marcus Riccelli, D-Spokane. 
Republicans still oppose the bill, arguing that it will encourage more workers to go on strike and ​​result in higher costs for businesses. 
“When you look at how this is going to work in a large, long-term strike, I think everybody’s going to pay at some level, and that just seems frankly unfair to me,” said Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia. 
Workers would be eligible for unemployment benefits starting the second Sunday after a strike begins, plus a one-week waiting period. 
The benefits would also be extended to workers affected by an employer-initiated lockout, something labor advocates point to as a tactic businesses can use to put pressure on workers during contract negotiations.
Benefits would have to be repaid if a strike is determined to be prohibited by state or federal law. 
The bill would require the state’s Employment Security Department to submit annual reports to the Legislature with data on the prevalence of strikes in the state and the cost of benefits for striking workers for Washington’s unemployment insurance trust fund. 
If it becomes law, the bill would take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, and is set to expire Dec. 31, 2035.

(Washington State Department of Transportation)Washington lawmakers announced Saturday a $15.5 billion plan to pay for a wide range of transportation needs, from highway megaprojects to state ferries. 
It’s backed by the first gas tax increase in nearly a decade. The package is a jump from what is now expected to be a $13.2 billion transportation budget for the current biennium. 
More than a third of the new budget will pay for road improvements, with another almost $1.6 billion to spend on highway maintenance and road preservation. 
The bipartisan framework for the next two-year budget cycle that starts July 1 includes $895 million for new ferries, terminal improvements and vessel preservation, $1.1 billion for the removal of obstacles to fish migration and $312 million in rail investments and port electrification. 
The total funding included in Senate Bill 5161 is more than what the House had initially proposed, and less than the Senate’s plan. 
No workers would face furloughs. Initially, the Senate proposed 13 furlough days in fiscal year 2026 for many state transportation workers. 
As in the original House version, some road projects not already contracted would be paused, but many of the biggest would continue. 
“We’re keeping our promises on the core projects,” said Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds. “I think it’s been a very difficult process, but we’ve landed at a result that I think Washington is going to be proud of.”
A 6-cent boost to the gas tax will help the state keep its promises. This week, the state House and Senate approved raising or creating a bevy of taxes and fees, including the gas tax, shoveling an estimated $3.2 billion toward transportation over the next six years. The suite of new revenue now awaits action from Gov. Bob Ferguson, a first-term Democrat.
The revenue package received no Republican support in the House and five Republican votes in the Senate.
Funding transportation for the next biennium came with numerous challenges, including soaring costs for highway construction, state ferry replacements, and culvert removals. Languishing gas tax proceeds make up much of the state’s transportation revenue, and a warming planet is fueling moves toward more energy-efficient vehicles.
These problems left transportation with a $1 billion shortfall in the next two-year budget, growing to $8 billion over the next six years. Without new money, lawmakers warned of major projects left unfinished. 
Lawmakers have to balance the budget across four years.
“I don’t think there’s ever been a more challenging piece of legislation that we’ve worked through,” said Rep. Andrew Barkis, the top House Republican on transportation policy.
Negotiations between the House and Senate were made even more difficult by the gulf that separated their two initial proposals. For one, the Senate looked to eliminate half of the shortfall through a creative plan to move funding for the court-ordered removal of fish passage barriers to the construction budget. The House didn’t take up the idea.
The budget announcement comes on day 104 of the 105-day legislative session, so both chambers plan to pass it Sunday. 
The framework is dedicated to Sen. Bill Ramos, who worked on the transportation budget before his unexpected death last Saturday while on a trail run near his home in Issaquah.
“This has been a difficult process,” said Liias, the chair of the Senate Transportation Committee. “Losing our friend a week ago and trying to write a budget while we were all heartbroken made a very difficult task almost impossible.”
Highways
The proposed money will keep on track some of the state’s behemoth highway undertakings, like the North Spokane Corridor, Puget Sound Gateway spanning King and Pierce counties and improvements on State Route 520 between Seattle and Redmond.
And $580 million is included for the new Interstate 5 Columbia River Bridge spanning Washington and Oregon. Lawmakers this session also approved authorizing the sale of $2.5 billion in bonds to help pay for the replacement. The bond bill now sits on Ferguson’s desk.
The bridge replacement will cost an estimated $5 billion to $7.5 billion. Permits are anticipated by 2026, and construction is projected to last until 2032.
Ferries
One of the many needs looming over budget writers this session was the transition to a hybrid-electric ferry fleet.
Ferguson, though, announced last month that the state would postpone conversions of the state’s largest vessels as Washington has struggled to keep enough ferries in service. The first conversion fell well behind schedule and ballooned in price.
State officials will likely reconsider the conversions after the FIFA World Cup next summer. 
Meanwhile, bids for five brand new hybrid-electric vessels are due next month. 
The proposed budget for this biennium includes $274 million for new ferry construction, $221 million for preservation of existing ferries and $151 million for terminal electrification.
Proceeds from carbon auctions under the Climate Commitment Act make up almost $1.4 billion of the total budget. That money would pay for $461 million for public transit, $316 million in active transportation projects, $230 million for ferries and $225 million for work on electrification and alternative fuels. 
And speaking of the World Cup, the budget includes $9 million in grants for public transit agencies to provide increased service during the tournament.
Fish
Washington state officials last year acknowledged they couldn’t meet the goal of opening up 90% of the habitat that culverts have long blocked by 2030. 
That benchmark came after a judge found the state violated tribes’ treaty fishing rights by installing poorly designed and maintained culverts, which carry water under roadways. So the state has to pay to correct these barriers that impede salmon and steelhead migration in western Washington. 
But like other transportation projects, this work has skyrocketed in cost, with some remaining endeavors facing price tags upward of $100 million. 
The state and tribes are entering mediation to figure out a new path forward that recognizes the state’s fiscal reality and the upstream and downstream barriers that would still block fish passage even after state culverts are removed. 
The state Senate had pushed a plan to borrow up to $5 billion to address the culvert shortfall. But the bipartisan proposal ran into opposition that doomed its chances this year, including from the governor.
Liias hopes lawmakers can revive the legislation, Senate Bill 5804, next year.
But for now, he called the $1.1 billion for this work a “good-faith step to show our tribal leaders we’re serious” as the state enters mediation.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sr-520-bridge-montlake-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-26 22:04:15.362087

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Democrats in the Washington Legislature unveiled a budget deal Saturday that cuts spending and hikes taxes on thousands of businesses to maintain core public services and erase a projected multibillion-dollar shortfall.
The agreement hammered out by House and Senate budget writers does not tap the state’s emergency reserves or furlough state employees, as prior proposals this year suggested doing. It pays for new collective bargaining agreements for state workers and provides $100 million for law enforcement hiring sought by the governor.
Overall, it spends $77.8 billion in the two-year budget cycle that begins July 1, roughly 9% higher than the current biennium. When all the adding and subtracting is done, there’s $7.4 billion in new spending, officials said.
It will be teed up for votes in each chamber on Sunday, the last scheduled day of the 2025 session.
“We’ve worked diligently to write a budget that addresses the fiscal challenges that we have, and continues to fund the core services that the people of Washington expect us to fund, and they depend on,” said Sen. June Robinson, D-Everett, chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee.
“There are many reductions throughout the budget that are harmful, are going to be hard for people, and for agencies to implement,” she continued. “We’re all eyes wide open about that.”
Robinson was one of four Democrats on the conference committee reconciling differences between the spending plans passed by the Senate and House. Two Republican lawmakers on the panel have not been at the table for negotiations.
One of them, Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, the budget leader for Senate Republicans, criticized the process, then voted against adopting the final product 
“It’s been developed in the back halls of Olympia, out of view of the public,” he said. “I honestly believe it brings shame on the Legislature for doing it this way.”
Overall, there aren’t many surprises as the blueprint tracks with major contours of what Democrats pushed through in each chamber. 
To balance, it depends on $4.3 billion from a combination of transfers from other accounts, plus a slate of new and higher taxes on businesses and services that will start taking effect this fall. Transfers, targeted cuts, and a money-saving maneuver involving pension funds are also needed to make ends meet.
Gov. Bob Ferguson, who is completing his first session, fared well. 
In his inaugural address, he threatened to veto any budget that did not have $100 million to help local governments hire more police. There’s exactly that amount. He also wanted the state’s rainy day fund left untouched, and it was.
Ferguson did not respond to the Standard’s request for comments on the budget.
Robinson and Rep. Timm Ormsby, D-Spokane, chair of the House Appropriations Committee and a conferee, declined to say if they thought Ferguson would sign the budget.
“I can just say that the Legislature, pending approval of this conference report, will have fulfilled its constitutional and statutory obligation,” Ormsby said.
Robinson added: “The executive branch is its own branch of government. I cannot predict nor do I know what they will choose to do.”
The ledger sheet
By law, the Legislature must adopt a budget that is balanced over four fiscal years. Practically speaking, the immediate concern is the next two-year fiscal cycle that begins July 1.
Under the deal, the state will spend $77.8 billion in that period and end with $225 million in its cash reserves and $2 billion stashed in the rainy day fund.
It contains $4.4 billion to maintain levels of services required under current law. One of the largest chunks of new spending is for education, with another $682 million for elementary and secondary schools. Most of it will go to districts for providing special education services, buying materials and paying expenses like utilities and insurance.
There are cuts throughout. One of the most painful for Democrats: delayed expansions planned under the Fair Start for Kids Act. The 2021 law expands and guarantees access to state-paid early learning programs and subsidized child care for families with lower household incomes. 
Under the law, the Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program is supposed to become an entitlement next year. It won’t. There will also be delays to broadened eligibility for the Working Connections Child Care Program. Increased reimbursement rates for providers will be pushed off as well.
A reprieve for state workers
Ferguson proposed furloughing state employees one day a month in the next budget cycle to save $300 million. Senate Democrats proposed 13 unpaid days off to save half as much. Senate Republicans wanted to not fund the recently brokered labor contracts, which include a 5% pay raise over two years, and instead give each worker a $5,000 bonus.
None of that is happening. Nearly a billion dollars is penciled in to cover the contracts.
“The state needs to be a model employer,” Ormsby said. “We need to project outward to the rest of the state what it looks like to appreciate the work that people do, compensate them fairly and keep them employed.”
Taxing matters
Democrats had designs for raising up to $21 billion from new and higher taxes in the next four fiscal years. Ferguson shook his head no. 
They went back to the drawing board and came up with a different approach projected to net $4.3 billion for the coming budget and $4.4 billion in the one after that. 
It would permanently boost the primary business and occupation tax rates. Sales tax would be applied to more services. New surcharges are coming for Washington companies with more than $250 million in annual revenue. Higher tax rates are in store for financial institutions with more than $1 billion in earnings. A few tax breaks disappear. And an existing tax gets broadened to include nicotine pouches, like Zyn.
Two gimmicks gone, one added
Democrats put forth two eye-rolling, money-moving maneuvers with their earlier budget proposals. They’re put away now.
One required certain companies to prepay a month’s worth of sales tax. The thinking was to get those dollars paid into the final month of the next budget cycle that would’ve otherwise been due in the first month of the following one. It would have been like creating a 25th month of collections.
The other idea was to change the timing and amounts of apportionment payments to school districts to push hundreds of millions of dollars in spending into the 2027-29 budget.
A new move involving the state’s pension funds is in. Senate Bill 5357 lets budget writers assume a greater return on dollars invested through the state’s pension accounts – 7.25% up from the 7% set by the Pension Funding Council in 2023.
Assuming the higher rate of return means that the state can meet its funding obligations for the pensions while contributing less money to them. But jacking up the rate also raises the risk of investments not meeting higher targets, and the plans gradually becoming underfunded. Washington is generally known for having healthy public employee pension plans.
In the next four years, the shift will allow the state to save about a billion dollars by making lower payments into its pension system.
Last word
“Affordability” is one of the session buzzwords. 
Republicans have argued new and higher taxes for the operating budget will drive up costs for “hard-working Washingtonians.” Gildon said the tax increases will equate to about $2,000 a year for a family of four.
Democrats contend the steps they are taking will bolster public schools and preserve access to critical services for the state’s most vulnerable residents.
Robinson said the budget is not the one “we thought we’d be writing a year ago. That’s the hard job of governing, trying to find the balance between funding the needs of our state, the services and programs that our people depend on and rely on, and finding ways to pay for it.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1629-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-26 21:00:17.577284

(Ian Stewart/Virginia Mercury)Roughly 150 people jammed a meeting room at the Twin Hickory Public Library in Henrico County Saturday, demanding U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, oppose sweeping federal spending cuts and immigration measures stemming from President Donald Trump’s administration. The event highlighted the scrutiny Wittman and other Virginia congressional representatives have faced for how they engage with people in their districts.
Wittman, who declined an invitation to the event, was represented by an empty chair at the front of the room. Many who spoke about their concerns addressed their comments to the chair.
Attendee Ericka Kopp pulled out a copy of the Constitution and read parts of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments that addressed her concerns about the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration reform policies.
Wittman, who has represented Virginia’s 1st Congressional District since 2007, supported executive orders Trump issued in January cracking down on illegal immigration to the United States and expanding federal agencies’ authority to identify and expel undocumented immigrants from the country. Wittman and other supporters framed the orders as a way to halt drugs and dangerous criminals from entering the country, while detractors said the policies unfairly target immigrants, limit due process and pull families apart.

Kopp said parts of the text do not refer to “citizens of this nation” but instead to “all people” as having a right to a fair trial for crimes, who can’t have their “life, liberty or property” deprived without due process of law. 
“Amendment Six, ‘the accused shall enjoy,’ again, not citizens – all ‘people,’” she said. “So Representative Wittman, I ask that you read the Constitution and apply it accordingly.” 
  A town hall dubbed “Where’s Wittman? A Town Hall in Absentia for Virginia’s First Congressional District,” organized by Democracy Circle RVA, was held in Henrico County on Saturday, April 26, 2025. (Ian Stewart/Virginia Mercury)
Vietnam veteran Jim Kutz voiced his concerns about the administration’s recent arrest of a circuit court judge who was accused of helping a man evade immigration authorities. He addressed his question to the entire room.
“What other leader arrested judges?” he asked. “Hitler, Mussolini and other dictators arrested judges. I think we are all very concerned about the rule of law.” In pointed remarks directed at Wittman, Kutz said, “We want you to speak up on the floor and introduce resolutions supporting the rule of law and speak out about the appalling things that are happening in the White House.”
The event, dubbed “Where’s Wittman? A Town Hall In Absentia for Virginia’s First Congressional District,” was put on by Democracy Circle RVA, a group who started meeting after Trump’s second inauguration, said organizer Jenny Pribble. 
“We’re a group of friends and neighbors, a loose-knit organization,” she said. “A lot of us have experience in political organizing, but decided this time we wanted to be engaged very locally with our immediate neighbors. I think what unites us is a real concern about attacks on rule of law, attacks on democratic institutions, and challenges now with due process.”
The group also contrasted the administration’s action with the Fourteenth Amendment,  which identifies American citizens as “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” and declares that states shouldn’t deny “any person” due process of law and “equal protection of the laws.” 
“His job is to represent his constituents, and his constituents are showing up, and they would like him to listen,” said Pribble.

In an email to the Virginia Mercury ahead of Saturday’s town hall, Wittman’s communications director Julianne Heberlein said the congressman wasn’t planning on attending the event because it wasn’t organized by his office and because he was “already committed to several other events in the district that day.” 
Wittman also directly addressed the town hall organizers in the email, defending his record of engaging with constituents and tackling important issues.
“I’ve consistently hosted live telephone town halls, and I’m proud that my most recent one reached approximately 9,000 constituents,” he wrote. “We covered a range of topics — from Social Security and veterans’ issues to the economy — and I always welcome tough questions, even from those who disagree with me.”
On March 26, Wittman held a telephone town hall via Facebook that his office says drew 9000 people. The video on Facebook has since been removed. Callers had to register on Wittman’s website in order to be a part of the conversation. According to Heberlein, Wittman has hosted from three to seven telephone town halls per year since about 2009.
Wittman said the telephone town halls allow him to connect to thousands of residents in the district, which spans from parts of Henrico, Hanover and Chesterfield Counties in Central Virginia to parts of the Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula. There are over 471,000 registered voters in the district, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. Though he values meeting with people in person, Wittman said, he encourages people to sign up on his website for the next telephone town hall.
Democracy Circle RVA did meet with Wittman on March 14, where they hand delivered an invitation signed by 79 people. 
“When we met with Rob Whitman in person, we discussed a range of issues, and on a number of issues he seemed to agree with us,” said Pribble. “But he insisted that he didn’t have a lot of power to change things beyond voting for a budget or voting against a budget. But we know that Article I gives Congress a lot of powers of oversight, of investigation.”
According to VoteSmart, a nonpartisan website compiling information on candidates and elected officials, Wittman’s recent voting record shows he voted in favor of Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, a bill that requires individuals to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections. He has also voted “yea” to several measures designed to enhance security as the country’s southern border. In his March video town hall, Wittman also supported sweeping federal spending cuts. 
“We have $1.7 trillion of a deficit this year, and $36 trillion of debt for the nation,” Wittman said. “That’s on the backs of our children and our children’s children,” the Daily Press reported.
Pribble said the town hall, where state Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, was also in attendance, was recorded and will be shared with Whittman’s office.
“He needs to hear from his constituents about how this moment is shaping families’ lives. We have a lot of federal workers in this district. They’ve been hit hard, and I think Whitman needs to show up and hear from us,” said Pribble.

(Luke Sharrett/Getty Images)More states are enacting bans on “Glock switches,” small devices about the size of a U.S. quarter that can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons capable of firing up to 1,200 rounds per minute.
Gun conversion devices have become a rare point of bipartisan agreement on gun policy. Although firearm regulations often face pushback in Republican-led states, growing support from local law enforcement officials has helped these bans gain traction.
Last month, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears. A sear is the part of the gun that holds the hammer or firing pin back until the trigger is pulled.
“While there is a federal ban on these gun conversion devices, we needed a way to empower our own law enforcement here in Alabama to get these illegal and extremely dangerous Glock switches off our streets,” Ivey said in a statement after signing the bill into law.
These devices, which can be 3D printed or bought online for as little as $20, have become closely associated with Glock handguns, which are often cited as some of the easiest to modify.

Georgia-based Glock Inc. doesn’t manufacture, market or sell the devices, but the brand has become synonymous with them, fueled in part by frequent use of the term “Glock switch” in some genres of music and on social media platforms.
The growing use of these devices in crimes — including mass shootings — has prompted lawsuits from several cities and states accusing Glock of failing to prevent illegal modifications and contributing to public safety risks.
The company did not respond to Stateline’s multiple requests for comment.

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, signed an auto sear ban into law in February as part of a broader public safety package. New Jersey could become the 27th state to enact a ban, after its General Assembly approved the measure in late March.
Other states — including Virginia and deeply conservative Mississippi — also have recently enacted bans. In GOP-led Tennessee, lawmakers are considering a similar measure, but the bill is still in committee and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns on April 25.
“It’s a big deal to talk about places like Alabama, Mississippi, Virginia, Indiana putting these laws on their books,” Monisha Henley, the senior vice president for governmental affairs at the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, told Stateline. “There is a general consensus that we don’t want a switch or device or auto sear to be able to attach to a firearm and turn into a weapon or war.”
Recovered at crime scenes
The bans on auto sears are a response to a sharp nationwide increase in the number of modified firearms being recovered at crime scenes.
In 2023, law enforcement agencies recovered 4,530 machine gun conversion devices, or auto sears, at crime scenes across the country, according to the latest annual data from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, commonly known as the ATF.


The number of these devices recovered and traced by the bureau, a process that involves tracking a firearm or device back to its first point of sale or distribution, rose from 658 in 2019 to 5,816 in 2023 — a 784% increase, according to a recent report. That total includes recoveries from all 50 states as well as U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.
Between 2019 and 2023, conversion devices made up nearly 13% of all privately made firearms recovered by police and traced by the bureau — 11,088 out of 88,425 total.


Machine guns and conversion devices have been heavily restricted under federal law since 1934. While civilians can legally own machine guns made before 1986, those firearms must be registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. Newer machine guns and conversion devices are generally illegal.
There are exceptions for licensed dealers and manufacturers producing them for military or law enforcement use. Possession of an unregistered device carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and/or a $250,000 fine.
The White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, created by former President Joe Biden in 2023, quietly disappeared from the web on Jan. 21. Its website now returns a 404 error.
Just days before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, a task force within the office delivered a list of strategies aimed at cracking down on machine gun conversion devices.
Trump, who campaigned on loosening gun regulations, signed an executive order in February directing the U.S. Department of Justice to review all federal rules and guidance for potential infringements on Second Amendment rights, including those issued by the shuttered Office of Gun Violence Prevention.

In early April, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi announced the creation of the Second Amendment Enforcement Task Force within the Justice Department. The announcement came soon after the rollback of the ATF’s “zero tolerance” policy, which previously required the agency to revoke the licenses of firearms dealers found to have willfully committed serious violations, such as selling guns without background checks or falsifying sales records.
Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department also established a separate task force, known as the ANTI-MCD Committee, to coordinate efforts and provide guidance on reducing the spread of machine gun conversion devices. Federal restrictions on machine guns and gun conversion devices remain in effect for now, but could change under the Trump administration.
Some gun rights groups argue state-level auto sear bans are unnecessary because the devices are already illegal under federal law.
“The overwhelming majority of gun owners are law-abiding citizens and are not just going to illegally produce or purchase auto sears,” Chris Stone, the director of state affairs for Gun Owners of America, told Stateline. “When you make it doubly illegal, it’s not stopping any criminals who are purchasing auto sears on the black market.”
Alabama and New Mexico
Alabama’s ban on auto sears comes in the wake of a mass shooting in Birmingham last September in which the devices were used. The shooting left four people dead and 17 others injured.
The new law, which was sponsored in the Senate by Republican state Sen. Will Barfoot, makes it a felony to possess or sell any combination of parts intended to create an auto sear. Violators could face up to 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine.
“This wasn’t about infringing on people’s gun rights. This was about making our community safer for everyone,” Democratic state Rep. Phil Ensler, who collaborated with Barfoot on the bill, told Stateline. Ensler also pushed for an auto sear ban during the past two legislative sessions.
The legislation exempts law enforcement and individuals who register their firearms with the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.










This wasn't about infringing on people's gun rights. This was about making our community safer for everyone.


– Alabama state Rep. Phil Ensler, D-Montgomery


According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 1,292 gun-related deaths in Alabama in 2023 — the latest year for which data is available. Alabama had the fourth-highest gun death rate in the nation at 25.3 deaths per 100,000 residents. The District of Columbia, Mississippi and Louisiana had higher rates that year.
New Mexico saw 530 gun deaths in 2023, placing it just behind Alabama with the fifth-highest gun death rate at 25.1 deaths per 100,000 residents.
Las Cruces, New Mexico, Police Chief Jeremy Story has expressed strong support for the new auto sear ban, which makes possession of a conversion device punishable by up to three years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Story also raised concern over the rise in juvenile crime, particularly the increasing use of gun conversion devices by teenagers.
Supporters in both Alabama and New Mexico argue that making possession of the devices a state offense allows local authorities to prosecute cases without relying on the limited resources of the federal court system.

“If this were not a state law … it’s completely unenforceable,” Ben Baker, the senior public safety adviser in the New Mexico governor’s office, told Stateline. “The federal government simply doesn’t have the resources, nor do they generally prosecute juvenile offenders,” said Baker, who has nearly 30 years of law enforcement experience.
Lawsuits against Glock
Several states and cities across the United States are taking legal and legislative action against Glock.
Lawsuits filed by Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey and the cities of Baltimore and Chicago argue that Glock has long known about the widespread use of illegal auto sears but has failed to redesign its firearms to prevent these modifications.
In a court filing requesting the dismissal of Chicago’s lawsuit, Glock argued it should not be held responsible for illegal modifications made by third parties.
Beyond the courtroom, some states are weighing measures to prohibit the sale of firearms that can be easily modified with auto sears.
In California, such a bill has already passed out of the Assembly Judiciary Committee. A similar bill in New York has stalled in a Senate committee since January. Both states’ legislatures remain in session until September and June, respectively, leaving time for the proposals to advance further.
Maryland lawmakers also considered a similar measure this year, but the bill failed to make it out of a House committee before the legislature adjourned in early April.
Meanwhile, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, signed a bill into law in early April that added “pistol converters,” or auto sears, to the state’s definition of rapid-fire modification devices. Possession of these devices already carried strict penalties.

Bob Ferguson’s inaugural address on Jan. 15, 2025, at the state Capitol in Olympia.

The move was successful and delayed a vote on the bill. (Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Standard)Democrats were moments away from passing a cap on residential rent increases off the Washington state Senate floor Friday night. 
But a challenge from the Senate Republican leader, upheld by the lieutenant governor, is forcing a delay. 
The issue amounts more to a do-over than a derailment. Democrats are now poised to vote on House Bill 1217 on Sunday, the last scheduled day of the legislative session. 
The move from Sen. John Braun, R-Centralia, late Friday came after about an hour of impassioned speeches about the help or damage that could result from the annual limit on rent increases, currently proposed to be 7% plus inflation or 10%, whichever is lower.
At issue is the bill’s title: “Improving housing stability for tenants subject to the residential landlord-tenant act and the manufactured/mobile home landlord-tenant act by limiting rent and fee increases, requiring notice of rent and fee increases, limiting fees and deposits, establishing a landlord resource center and associated services, authorizing tenant lease termination, creating parity between lease types, and providing for attorney general enforcement.”
This title is much longer than that of just about any other legislation this session in Olympia.
Braun argued it’s overly prescriptive, leaving little room for amendments, and no longer accurately described the proposal. He noted the bill didn’t have the original online “landlord resource center” the state Department of Commerce would have been required to create.
“If an aspect of the bill is removed yet still referenced in the title, it simply does not provide an accurate description for the public,” Braun said. “It’s like if we had a bill that talked about whales that were going to be in danger from outboard motors, and then we didn’t talk about whales, we talked about manatees.”
An amendment approved on the House floor six weeks ago, from Rep. Nicole Macri, a Seattle Democrat and one of the measure’s chief backers, took out the landlord resource center requirement. A month later, the Senate passed the bill without that requirement.
In response to Braun, Sen. Marcus Riccelli, D-Spokane, noted the legislation still had other resources for landlords.
Lt. Gov. Denny Heck, who serves as president of the Senate, took an extended break before delivering his ruling on the arguments. While noting drafters have “great latitude” to choose a bill title, the Democrat said this one breaks Senate rules.
“As this President and my predecessors have warned, while selecting such a title may tend to protect a bill by preventing certain unwarranted amendments to the bill, it is not without risk in the Senate, especially when changes are made to the bill,” said Heck. He concluded: “Senator Braun’s point is well taken and the measure is ineligible for final passage in its present form.”
Democratic staff and lawmakers responded with muttered expletives in the wings. 
The hullabaloo, which unfolded around 9 p.m. on Friday, came just a day after Democrats in the two chambers released a negotiated proposal meant to strike a compromise between the 7% limit on rent increases the House backed and the Senate-supported 10% plus inflation. 
To deal with Heck’s ruling, Democrats had to convene a second so-called conference committee to draft a revised proposal that adds back the resource center. They released the new version Saturday morning, about 12 hours after the previous bill collapsed.
“We know that our landlords are important, and I’m happy to see that in this final conference report that we have a landlord resource center so that they can get the resources that they need,” said Senate Housing Committee Chair Jessica Bateman, D-Olympia.
The chambers must now wait 24 hours before voting on it.
Despite the latest setback, Democrats emphasized this would just mean a delay, not the divisive legislation’s demise. 
“We’re going to pass rent stabilization this session,” House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, said after a meeting with senators following Heck’s decision Friday night. 
But at the conference committee meeting Saturday morning, Rep. Sam Low, R-Lake Stevens, raised another issue: Can the new version of the bill include something not included in the iterations that passed the House and Senate?

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A property tax reform bill viewed as an alternative in case the primary measure fails passed the Senate unanimously Friday, putting pressure on a proposal supported by Gov. Kelly Armstrong to cross the finish line.
House Bill 1168 was amended to mirror many of the provisions in House Bill 1176, the bill sponsored by Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, that Armstrong supports.
“It’s a very good bill and it’s there if (House Bill) 1176 fails,” said Sen. Mark Weber, R-Casselton. “Everything is ready to go here in (House Bill) 1168 and it contains significant relief along with our preferences from the Senate as to what needs to be included.”
North Dakota Senate advances property tax credit but plan differs from House

House Bill 1168 includes a primary residence credit of up to $1,650, an expansion of the homestead property tax credit, up to $600 for a renters rebate and an expansion of a disabled veterans property tax relief program.
The bill also includes a “skin-in-the-game” provision requiring primary residence owners to pay at least 25% of their property tax bill. Each primary residence would receive at least $500. Another provision urges lawmakers in the 2027 session to look at providing relief to other property types, such as commercial, centrally assessed, agricultural land and other residential property. 
In total, the bill is expected to provide more than $511 million in relief for the biennium, according to the most recent fiscal note provided by Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus.
The bill also includes similar 3% caps, which would limit local subdivision increases on property tax levies. Weber added, if the property valuation increases outpace the 3% cap, House Bill 1168 includes language to support school districts by making up the difference through the school funding formula to make their budgets whole.
Sen. Judy Lee, R-West Fargo, told lawmakers the large price tag for the bill is worrying especially at a time when the federal government is debating to reduce its cost share of Medicaid expansion payments to the states.
“If they change the federal match for Medicaid and Medicaid expansion, we are in big trouble,” Lee said. “It could be up to $330 million that the state will not get from the feds.”
North Dakota governor unveils bold property tax plan in first State of the State address

Sen. Brad Bekkendahl, R-Williston, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the Senate Appropriations Committee disagreed with Kroshus on the number of people that will use the new primary residence credit.
He said March 31 was the deadline to apply for the primary residence credit and about 143,000 North Dakota homeowners applied, which is less than 165,000 that were deemed eligible.
“We felt that the numbers in the fiscal note were inflated to a point where we actually took $70 million off on our calculation from these numbers … based on the number of homes we think will be actually paid the credit,” Bekkedahl said. 
House Bill 1168 will be returned to the House for its consideration of the Senate changes to the bill. If they do not agree with the changes, the bill differences will be resolved in a conference committee.
House Bill 1176, meanwhile, is in a conference committee, with the “skin in the game” provision a major point of contention between the House and Senate.

The truck was operated not by Hilcorp, the oil company, but by Brice Inc., a Native-owned construction firm that has worked with Hilcorp on its preparations for the summer drilling efforts in the remote Yukon Flats basin, north of Fairbanks.
Hilcorp is staging equipment for the drilling program at the Yukon River Camp, where the Dalton Highway, which connects urban Alaska to the North Slope oil fields, crosses the Yukon River. Once the ice on the river clears, the equipment will be barged up the Yukon toward drill sites.

	Thom Leonard, a spokesman for Brice’s parent company, Calista, said Brice’s truck was “between jobs” when the spill occurred earlier this month at a parking lot at the camp, which is run by a Fairbanks-based tourism business on federal land. 
The lot is typically used for “multi-day barging storage,” according to a post-spill report from Brice to regulators at the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, known as DEC.
There’s no indication that the fuel reached the Yukon itself, according to documents released by DEC. 
But critics of the drilling effort say the spill still serves as an example of the type of incidents that can happen during industrial operations like oil exploration.
The spill left some 600 gallons of pooled fuel in the parking lot that had to be vacuumed up by another truck. A video of the site obtained by Northern Journal showed workers walking through an ankle-deep pool that one of them described as diesel.
“We were told over and over again that we were overhyping the danger, we were alarmist, and that everything they were doing is perfectly safe,” Rhonda Pitka, the chief of the tribal government in the Yukon River village of Beaver, said in a phone interview. “It’s so disappointing.”

	Oil companies often hire contractors to perform specialized tasks, and Brice affiliates have worked for Hilcorp in the past.
Leonard, the spokesman for Brice’s parent company, would not say whether the truck had originally been in the area supporting Hilcorp, adding that “we don’t typically comment on clients we serve.” A Hilcorp spokesman also declined to comment. 
But an online update last month from Doyon Ltd., the regional Native corporation that owns land in the Yukon Flats where the oil drilling will take place, noted that a crew from Brice was doing debris clearing for Hilcorp’s exploration program.
A Doyon official said the company is aware of a situation that was reported to DEC but referred questions to Hilcorp as the “appropriate point of contact.”
Hilcorp’s search for oil in the Yukon Flats has support from Doyon and tribal leaders in Birch Creek, the Native village closest to where the summer drilling will take place. Other tribal leaders along the river and in Alaska’s Interior have harshly criticized the exploration campaign, saying that its potential risks are incompatible with the region’s salmon-dependent Native communities.

	While the spill took place April 6, according to documents released by DEC, drilling opponents only learned about it in recent days through word of mouth, according to Pitka. She described the incident as “exactly what we were afraid of.”
Opponents of the drilling program point to Hilcorp’s history in Alaska: The company, which traditionally has acquired and operated aging oil and gas infrastructure, has been fined for numerous incidents, and regulators have pointed to a “track record of regulatory noncompliance.”
A DEC official involved in the spill response, Terra Meares, described Brice as the “responsible party” for the spill and said that the purpose of the company’s equipment at the Yukon camp is beyond her agency’s jurisdiction. 
Decisions about potential penalties or enforcement actions, she added, would be made at higher levels of DEC. The director of the department’s spill prevention and response division was out of the office this week and unavailable for comment.
The truck was originally left at the parking lot April 4, “with no indication of leaks or issues,” according to Brice’s report to DEC. The spill was discovered early in the morning of April 6 by a camp resident who was watching the northern lights and saw or smelled fuel.
The truck’s tank holds 3,000 gallons, and the 600 gallons of “pooled fuel” were ultimately vacuumed up from snow- and ice-covered ground by another truck that was dispatched to the site, according to documents released by DEC. An excavator subsequently arrived at the site to remove thicker layers of contaminated ice, according to the documents.
Leonard, with Brice’s parent company, said the businesses “always strive to respect the environment.”
“We are Alaskans,” Leonard said in an email. “It pains us when incidents like this occur, although we are proud our team members took immediate action and followed all regulatory requirements.”

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)One of the toughest jobs in the South Dakota Legislature has to belong to Republican Party whips. Four legislators in each chamber are tasked with keeping their fellow GOP lawmakers in line. They’re supposed to ensure that the will of the majority leaders in both chambers is carried out by the party faithful. 
Whipping has to be a tough job in the Republican Party because there are so many members — 64 in the 70-member House and 32 in the 35-member Senate. It’s also a tough job because the Republican Party has been suffering from some growing pains, casting aside seasoned, traditional members in favor of a new breed with a different set of goals. 
There are plenty of new Republican faces in the Legislature and they bring with them a new set of issues. They’re keen on election integrity even though South Dakota elections are squeaky clean. They’re big on property rights, with many of the new batch winning primaries against incumbents who had the bad luck to vote for the Landowner Bill of Rights. They have a penchant for wanting to mix religious symbols with public education. Like traditional Republicans, they like to stretch the limits of the Second Amendment, this time going to the point where college students can be armed on campus and then don’t have to disarm themselves when they head to their favorite bar.

Some South Dakota lawmakers want to subject ballot questions to a tyranny of the minority
While criticizing absent Republicans, Democrats should look for their own candidates

Keeping a watchful eye on the work of legislators is Jim Eschenbaum, the new chairman of South Dakota’s Republican Party. A former Democrat, Eschenbaum earned his GOP bona fides by helping to recall the Landowner Bill of Rights and then defeating it at the ballot box. 
For those who pay attention to such things, the dust-ups between traditional Republicans and the new breed have been fun to watch. Eschenbaum seems intent on draining away that enjoyment. It looks like he wants what the Old Guard once had: everyone in the party voting in lockstep with leadership. 
If that’s the case, Eschenbaum had to be less than happy with a recent South Dakota Searchlight story that told how Republicans and Democrats worked together to soften a bill that, in its original form, would have caused librarians to be led away in handcuffs if a child was somehow allowed to check out obscene material. 
The path that House Bill 1239 took through the Legislature doesn’t reflect well on the Republican Party whips or party unity. The bill went through the House Education Committee on a 10-5 vote with four Republicans voting against the bill. In the full House, where a party-line vote would be 64-6, the bill passed 38-32 with 27 GOP members seeking its defeat. 
Over in the Senate, HB 1239 was endorsed 5-2 in the Senate Judiciary Committee with both no votes coming from Republicans. It was in the full Senate that the bill was amended to dispense with criminal penalties and instead require an appeals process for challenging materials in school and public libraries. That wasn’t easy-going, either, as the 18-16 vote included 16 votes to amend coming from Republicans. The amended bill sailed through the Senate 32-2. 
Back in the House, the amended bill was accepted, but not without a fight. The vote was 36-34 with 31 Republicans voting in favor of the amendment. That kind of split in the party will be grounds for a primary challenge if Eschenbaum has his way. 
In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight, Eschenbaum said a Republican should be a constitutional conservative, voting to represent the South Dakota Constitution, the U.S. Constitution and the conservative values reflected in the party platform. 
To make sure lawmakers are toeing the party line, Eschenbaum has proposed a South Dakota GOP scorecard to keep track of how legislators vote. “I don’t know if the state central committee will decide to do it,” Eschenbaum said, “but it would be based on those three principles, the two constitutions and the party platform.”
Just as lawmakers who voted for the Landowner Bill of Rights were targeted in the last primary, it’s not hard to imagine Eschenbaum’s scorecard being used to drum up primary opponents for Republican lawmakers who insist on going their own way. “Just because you’re elected to office currently does not guarantee you’re going to get reelected to office again,” Eschenbaum said. “It just doesn’t.”
Some people may take heart when they see Republicans and Democrats working together in the Legislature so that librarians won’t be led away in chains. Others may think it’s refreshing when lawmakers have the courage to vote their conscience rather than toe the party line. It’s obvious that the new chairman of the Republican Party doesn’t see it that way.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Interior designers who work on large commercial construction projects may soon be required to get a state license if they want to work in Alaska.
On Wednesday, the Alaska Senate voted 18-2 to approve Senate Bill 54, which would create an interior design licensing process and modify the way the state regulates landscape architects.
If approved by the House and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, SB 54 would extend the term of the Board of Architects, Engineers, and Land Surveyors and it would require interior designers working on large, public-use projects to register with that board.
Sen. Matt Claman, D-Anchorage, is the bill’s prime sponsor and said that the requirement is intended to improve the safety of commercial buildings.
“It’s part of our continuing work to make Alaska open and ready for business,” he said on the Senate floor.
In his sponsor statement, Claman said that the licensing would allow interior designers to submit stamped plans to permitting agencies for approval, potentially eliminating the need for a more expensive engineering review.
This is the third time that Claman has sponsored a bill requiring the registration of interior designers. Previous bills did not pass either the House or Senate, but this version is narrower than prior versions, said Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer. 
She opposed those prior versions but was willing to vote in favor of this one.
The “no” votes came from Sen. Robert Myers, R-North Pole, and Senate Minority Leader Mike Shower, R-Wasilla.
Speaking after the vote, Myers said he is concerned about the way the number of regulated professions is growing.
“I’m very skeptical of creating more occupational licenses, requiring people to register more,” he said.
“We’ve got so many problems in the private sector already; I really hesitate putting in any more barriers to employment, any more barriers to business.”
The bill has been scheduled for a hearing on Wednesday in the House Labor and Commerce Committee.

Henry McMaster called for a “nuclear power renaissance” in his recent State of the State address. Our governor urged lawmakers to support a revival of our state’s failed nuclear plant.
That’s a mistake given the inconvenient facts surrounding our state’s recent history with the V.C. Summer nuclear debacle.
I researched the future prospects for new nuclear power projects in the United States. While small modular reactors, or SMRs, have long-term potential for U.S. nuclear power, SMR’s are still on the drawing board.
There currently are no new nuclear plants under construction in the U.S.
The Deloitte Research Center for Energy & Industrials did an analysis as to whether new nuclear power plants could meet the projected need for future energy generation. The extensive analysis presumed robust deployment for the design, manufacture and projected costs of new nuclear power over the next decade. Even then, nuclear power could only meet 10% of the projected increase just for new data center demand by 2035.
The National Electrical Manufacturers Association has projected that data center growth coupled with transportation electrification will drive a 50% increase in U.S. electricity demand through 2050.
The industry points to the reliability of nuclear power along with its lower emissions. But what about the construction delays and the resulting cost overruns? And what about the creation of more radioactive waste? High-level radioactive waste is currently being stored on site, but that waste will remain radioactive for thousands of years.
The U.S. doesn’t have a long-term repository for high-level radioactive waste.
Let’s look at Georgia’s recent experience with their Vogtle nuclear power plant. Vogtle was approved in 2009. Yet the project wasn’t completed until 2024, seven years behind schedule. To make matters worse, Vogtle’s projected costs ballooned from its initial estimate of $14 billion to roughly $35 billion.
As a result, Georgia’s ratepayers have seen six rate increases since 2023. Do we want rapid increases in our electric bills in South Carolina?
When it comes to building new nuclear power plants, the real problem comes down to excessive costs. Nuclear construction costs range from $6,417 per kilowatt to $12,681 per kW. Compare that to $1,290 per kW for new gas-fired plants. This vast difference in construction costs will result in much higher electric bills.
S.C. ratepayers would be on the hook for all nuclear construction costs. But it doesn’t end there. Add the costs of nuclear fuel, ongoing maintenance, and the storage of the nuclear waste, and the costs are astronomical.
S.C. ratepayers are already paying for the failed V.C. Summer nuclear plant after it was abandoned in 2017. That failed nuclear project ultimately bankrupted SCE&G and Westinghouse. Several utility executives were convicted and served prison or home detention sentences for their role in covering up those cost overruns.
Remember too that those same utility executives hid the independent Bechtel report from the Public Service Commission and the public. Why? So they could continue to get their millions in cash bonuses by covering up their crimes. If not for a mid-level whistleblower, this cover up would have cost our residents, small businesses and large industries even more damage.
Santee Cooper, our state-owned utility, is soliciting proposals to see if others might be interested in buying the partially built nuclear reactors. It seems inconceivable that any entity would want to invest in that failed project, though many companies have shown initial interest. Formal proposals are due May 5.
The experts interviewed by Utility Dive wouldn’t hazard a guess about how much it would cost to complete V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3.
Santee Cooper and Dominion Energy have already made it clear that they have no interest in trying to revive V.C. Summer, even though they still own the site.
When all is said and done, neither should South Carolina. We would be foolish to risk repeating those same mistakes again. The bottom line: New nuclear power plants are not a viable option. There’s too much risk.
Our state’s future power generation needs are best met with a mix of existing nuclear plants, existing gas plants, new solar coupled with battery storage, hydro dams and pump storage. Currently, solar panels with storage are the lowest cost option for our state’s electricity generation.
During an earnings call Wednesday, NextEra Energy CEO John Ketchum said the U.S. must remain realistic and pragmatic about its energy policies.
“We need to be practical about when technologies will be available at scale and how much they’ll cost when they show up — all of which factors into how much Americans pay on their electric bill each month,” he said.
Low-cost renewables and battery storage should be used as a “critical bridge,” he said. “We cannot isolate ourselves to just a couple of technologies, like gas and nuclear, which are much more expensive than they’ve ever been and take far longer to build.”
Small modular nuclear reactors are “still 10 years away at scale in the best of scenarios,” he added.
South Carolina should think twice about building more nuclear power plants.
Nuclear power plants are just too expensive to build. And the small modular nuclear reactors are a decade away from being a viable alternative.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_2264-1024x705.jpg,,,2025-04-26 09:12:14.138527

Civil rights activists started the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party to challenge the state’s all-white regular delegation to the Democratic National Convention. 
The regulars had already adopted this resolution: “We oppose, condemn and deplore the Civil Rights Act of 1964 … We believe in separation of the races in all phases of our society. It is our belief that the separation of the races is necessary for the peace and tranquility of all the people of Mississippi, and the continuing good relationship which has existed over the years.” 
In reality, Black Mississippians had been victims of intimidation, harassment and violence for daring to try and vote as well as laws passed to disenfranchise them. As a result, by 1964, only 6% of Black Mississippians were permitted to vote. A year earlier, activists had run a mock election in which thousands of Black Mississippians showed they would vote if given an opportunity. 
In August 1964, the Freedom Party decided to challenge the all-white delegation, saying they had been illegally elected in a segregated process and had no intention of supporting President Lyndon B. Johnson in the November election. 
The prediction proved true, with white Mississippi Democrats overwhelmingly supporting Republican candidate Barry Goldwater, who opposed the Civil Rights Act. While the activists fell short of replacing the regulars, their courageous stand led to changes in both parties.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/06001414/April26-Aaron_Henry_1964.jpg,,,2025-04-26 09:12:14.138527

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Early in this year’s legislative session, state officials looking to close a $3 billion budget gap targeted the “unsustainable growth” in developmental disabilities services as one of the main drivers of the deficit and set out to cut $457 million from the program.
What followed was 90 days of emotion, rallies, negotiating and arguing that ended with both sides getting to a place they could live with: Advocates were able to claw back close to $300 million in cuts and got program reductions to a level they said was regrettable but survivable, at least.
But after all that, both sides now wonder if they fixed the problem they set out to solve, of unsustainable growth in the self-directed care portion of the Developmental Disabilities Administration. One lawmaker said all of this year’s wrangling may amount to a Band-Aid on a problem they could be visiting again next year.
“I’m not sure that the legislature was able to address some of the underlying concerns with needs of the community being balanced against spending that seems to continue to increase,” said Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Anne Arundel and Howard) who serves on the Senate Finance Committee.
“I think there are still fundamental issues that are outstanding that probably need a deeper review, and agreement upon on what approach to take to bring spending on DDA services to a level that the state can sustain,” he said.
A spokesperson with the Department of Health said in a written statement Wednesday that the agency “expects to continue discussions on DDA program sustainability.”
“The Maryland Department of Health is deeply committed to providing high-quality services that support Marylanders with disabilities,” the statement said. “To drive that effort forward, the department will work in partnership with the Maryland General Assembly and key stakeholders.”

In early discussions on the fiscal 2026 budget, former Health Secretary Laura Herrera Scott pointed to an increase in enrollment for the “self-directed service” model of care as a contributing factor for the agency’s budget woes.
Enrollment for self-directed services grew more thatn 30% in both 2023 and 2024, particularly among young people moving from school into the Medicaid waiver program, according to the health department. Budget analysts have suggested that self-directed services tend to cost the state more than community-based services.
The DDA administers Medicaid waivers that allow Marylanders with developmental disabilities to receive a wide variety of services, from live-in caregiver supports to transportation, respite care, employment services and more.
At the end of 2024, there were about 16,800 Marylanders who selected a community model Medicaid waiver, where people join an established organization for disability care. Another 3,600 waiver recipients elected the self-directed model, where the waiver recipient or their family hires individual employees for services.
“It is true that people are choosing self-direction,” said Alicia Wopat, president of the Self-Directed Advocacy Network of Maryland. “I think COVID-19 gave people a glimpse into what self-direction is like, because providers sadly couldn’t provide during that period of time … I don’t think the growth is unexpected.”
Wopat hopes that the increased interest will mean that self-directed services can be protected in future budget discussions, not slashed with budget cuts.
“It’s important for all of us to have choices in how we run our lives, and it should be no different for people with a disability,” Wopat said.
The General Assembly ultimately cut some $164 million from the DDA in fiscal 2026, as part of the larger budget wrangling this year. For self-directed services, that means cuts to a program that helps families afford one-time expenses to support their family member with developmental disabilities, as well as caps on wage bonuses for some of the self-directed service care providers.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But despite those cuts, Lam said that there are still some details that need to be understood regarding the DDA budget. The “restored” funding this year serves as a “Band-Aid” on the issue, while lawmakers and community leaders figure out how to fund the developmental disabilities programs sustainably, he said.
“There are still questions on why the cost of these services continue to rise so significantly, why self-directed care seems to be rising significantly,” Lam said.
“That discussion is hard to have during the throes of session, and so what took place this session was a Band-Aid to hold the community over,” Lam said, “but it doesn’t address the underlying issues there that have been festering for a while.”
Temporary factors
There were other factors that led to the financial woes at the DDA, some of which were temporary and should not play as much of a role in future budget discussions as they did this year, said Laura Howell, CEO of the Maryland Association of Community Services.
Howell noted service providers have now all transitioned from the old payment model to a fee-for-service payment model, that should allow for better spending forecasts for the agency.
The previous model paid providers up-front and expenses would be reconciled at a later date. The department periodically needed to account for unexpected costs, as the older system did not accurately project spending needs to deliver services. The new model, which was being phased in over the past few years, providers are reimbursed for services delivered.
The health department agrees that the new payment system will help the state officials better understand the DDA’s spending.

Meanwhile, lawmakers have boosted reporting requirements from the health department so they can also keep tabs on spending at the DDA.
Other factors that contributed to some of budget deficit at the DDA were a result of higher pay increases for staff from an increase in the state’s minimum wage, and the expiration of COVID-era relief dollars that had been supporting the agency.
“So all of those things led to the [spending] issues that we saw this year. We shouldn’t be seeing those things moving forward, nothing should be a surprise,” Howell said.
Howell agrees that the “unanswered question” in future DDA budget talks is whether the state is able to support funding for self-directed services.
“It’s hard to imagine that we could possibly be anywhere close to the same situation where were with this year,” she said. “I can’t see any reason why the DDA shouldn’t be able to adequately and accurately project the cost moving forward, because all the data should be there. The only question is what happens with self-direction budgets.”
As for Wopat, she hopes that the state includes more voices from the self-directed services community so that the model can be protected for those who rely on care that is more individualized.
“I hope everyone is included in those conversations as to how to best manage what’s happened with the state’s finances,” Wopat said. “That stakeholders of all kinds have opportunities to collaborate and come up with solutions that are best for people.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024_nov19_selfdirected_disabilityrally_edit-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-26 08:01:21.620710

Admission to Africana studies, Asian studies, data analytics, disability studies, Middle East studies, philosophy, religious studies, Spanish and women’s and gender studies programs has been suspended starting with the 2025-26 school year “in compliance with SB1”, according to a Monday news release from the university.
Students currently enrolled in one of the programs can still complete their degree and all nine of these programs will remain available as minors.
“I also want to be clear that these disciplines remain an important part of UToledo,” Dr. Scott Molitor, Toledo’s interim provost and executive vice president of academic affairs, said in a written statement. “Faculty will continue to teach courses that are part of minors, certificates or concentrations, as well as significant components of our core curriculum.”
Senate Bill 1 bans diversity efforts, regulates classroom discussion, prohibits faculty strikes, creates post-tenure reviews, puts diversity scholarships at risk, and creates a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, and eliminates undergraduate degree programs that produce on average less than five degrees annually over a three-year period, among other things.
State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced the bill at the end of January, it quickly passed both chambers and Gov. Mike DeWine signed it into law March 28. It affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges, and is set to take effect at the end of June. Youngstown State University faculty are trying to get a referendum on the November ballot to block S.B. 1.
UT was already undergoing an annual review of low-enrolled academic programs when DeWine signed S.B. 1 into law, according to the university.
“At the same time UToledo was undergoing its program review process, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed into law Senate Bill 1, which includes language that requires universities to eliminate undergraduate programs that have conferred fewer than five degrees annually over any three-year period,” according to the university.
Those nine programs had 57 students majoring in them during the spring semester and 15 students graduated from those programs during the 2023-24 school year, according to the university.
Toledo is suspending 12 additional degree programs unrelated to S.B. 1. They are:

Bachelor of Business Administration in Organizational Leadership and Management
Bachelor of Science in Health Information Administration
Master of Arts in Philosophy
Master of Arts in Sociology
Master of Education in Educational Research and Measurement
Master of Education in Educational Technology
Master of Education in Educational Psychology
Master of Music in Music Performance
Master of Science in Geology
Ph.D. in Curriculum & Instruction: Early Childhood
Ph.D. in Curriculum & Instruction: Educational Technology
Ph.D. in Foundations of Education: Research and Measurement

“It is important to keep our academic portfolio current with the degree programs our students want and that industry needs from their higher education partner,” Molitor said. “This is now our third year of an annual process to evaluate our programs and make sure we are allocating resources to areas in high demand, which requires us to both look for new programs we should start offering and existing programs that we should stop offering.”

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — Following recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia, and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters — massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)
Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents, and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris, and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities, and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

If this bill becomes law, the state will prevent municipalities in Missouri from enacting source of income discrimination bans, and will void bans already in place in St. Louis, Webster Groves, Columbia and Clayton, along with a portion of Kansas City.
Source of income discrimination bans are designed to prevent landlords from refusing to rent to potential tenants based solely on the kind of income that they have available to them. Many landlords will only consider W-2 wages when evaluating potential tenants, but this helps to prevent many of the poorest among us from being able to access safe, stable housing.
A single mother may have child support payments as her primary source of income, but a landlord isn’t bound to consider that when she applies for tenancy. A bus driver who has suffered repetitive stress injuries and now receives Social Security Disability Insurance may also struggle to find a landlord who is willing to rent to them.
However, the most common form of source of income discrimination is a refusal to accept Housing Choice Vouchers, also known as Section 8, a federal housing program that has been addressing homelessness in the U.S. since 1974.
Despite being chronically underfunded by the federal government, these vouchers have been proven to lift people out of poverty, improve mental and physical health outcomes, and decrease homelessness. Seventy-five percent of HCV holders have extremely low incomes, defined as less than 30% of the federal poverty line (currently $32,150 for a family of four) or less than 30% of the local area median income.
These folks do not earn enough money to qualify for tenancy on their own; the section 8 program allows these families to pay 30% of their income in rent while the government pays the balance.
The legislation, which has cleared the House and Senate in differing forms, would make it extremely difficult for these low-income renters, the majority of whom have already experienced chronic homelessness, to find housing. It’s like finally finding a golden ticket after years of searching and then having it snatched away.
A 2018 study showed that over 67% of landlords refused to rent to voucher-holders in cities without source of income anti-discrimination laws. In comparison, less than 31% of landlords refused to rent to voucher holders in cities with source of income discrimination bans in place. This demonstrates that source of income discrimination bans are effective local public policy and should not be preempted by our state government.
This legislation is being framed as a protection for landlords, seeking to prevent them from being “forced” to participate in a federal program. They say that this is government infringement on the property rights of landlords. They say that it’s too hard to comply with government regulations for landlords who participate in the section 8 program.
This is utter and complete nonsense.
To participate as a landlord, property owners simply have to submit to an annual inspection and ensure that their rental rates are in compliance with federal Fair Market Rent standards, which are typically very generous. Inspection protocols have recently been revised to only consider key health and safety factors rather than cosmetic issues.
And, quite frankly, in listening to legislative committee discussion on this issue over the last two years, it seems like the concerns of landlords are actually centered on a prejudiced belief that poor renters are bad tenants.
Federal data shows that renters using housing vouchers are actually excellent tenants who stay in a unit for an average of 7 to 8 years, despite the fact that landlords are free to evict them for breaking the terms of their rental agreement. This is because of the program’s smooth transitions in employment status of renters, adjusting the amount paid by the government based on fluctuations in the income of the renter.
Voucher holders are also typically assigned a case manager that helps renters to understand the terms of their lease and comply with landlord regulations.
Over 86% of rental units in the country are owned by for-profit entities.
If we allow these landlords to opt-out of renting to single parents living on child support, individuals with disabilities that prevent them from working full-time, and seniors and other low-income families utilizing these federal vouchers, where do we envision they will go?
We are a nation that abhors the homeless, but we continue to pass policies that exacerbate homelessness.
Time and time again, Missouri legislators prioritize the perceived “rights” of business owners over ensuring the basic needs of Missourians.
Our state motto, “salus populi suprema lex esto,” translates to “the welfare of the people shall be the supreme law.”  Our legislators continue to defy this principle in favor of making it easier for business owners to make money.
The highest profile example of this behavior this session is the legislature pushing to overturn the new requirement for business owners to provide paid sick leave to employees that was just approved by voters in November. If you can’t afford to pay sick leave to your employees, you shouldn’t be in business.
And you shouldn’t leave families living on the streets because you are unwilling to take part in a fifty-year-old safety net program designed to keep them safely housed.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_4515-scaled-e1725567309853-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-04-26 07:00:15.662676

(Screenshot of Nebraska Public Media livestream)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s projected budget deficit for the next two years has grown by $190 million after the state’s economic forecasting board fixed its previous estimates to be more on target.
State lawmakers have less than a month to fill the gap.
The Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board on Friday afternoon revised its earlier projections for the final two months of this fiscal year as well as the next two fiscal years that lawmakers are considering in the annual budget-writing process. The budget advanced from the Appropriations Committee on Thursday, without revised projections, at the time with $124 million left to find.

Two measures advanced Thursday to the final stage of lawmaking, related to school retirement and repealing recently passed business incentives, filling that most recent budget hole with $7 million to spare.
That means the $190 million added to the next two fiscal years will nearly all need to be found in spending cuts or new revenue.
Lawmakers will begin debating the Appropriations Committee’s advanced budget bills May 6 and must send them to Gov. Jim Pillen by the end of the 80th legislative day: May 15.
The Friday revised projections also increased the budget hole for the current fiscal year by a separate $190 million amount. It will be absorbed through state reserves.
Disappointing but not unexpected
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, Appropriations Committee chair, attended the forecast and said future details will be day by day. Some cash reserves might be used.
Clements said he doesn’t like to be in a negative position but that Nebraska has good cash reserves. He’s hopeful the economy will be better than projected but senators “have to deal with the forecast that we have.”
  State Sen. Brad von Gillern of Elkhorn. Aug. 8, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, chair of the companion Revenue Committee, said he was disappointed in the forecast but that it’s reflective of global uncertainty, which leads to negativity in projections.
He said he doesn’t dispute the board’s numbers but was unhappy that internal projections between the Legislative Fiscal Office and Nebraska Department of Revenue weren’t more in sync. The average legislative estimates anticipated $300 million less revenue than the average department projections for the next biennium.
‘Chaos is the word of the day’
Former State Sen. John Kuehn of Heartwell, a member of the forecast board, was among the nine forecasters who said federal uncertainty is impacting their local communities.
“Chaos is the word of the day,” Kuehn said.
He said investments are unpredictable and that it is difficult for consumers or businesses to make firm long-term plans.
“Just keep your head on a swivel and see what the day’s news cycle is going to bring, and don’t open your accounts,” Kuehn said. “And if you do, be sitting down.”
  State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth. Aug. 13, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Other forecasters noted the up-and-down nature of tariffs from President Donald Trump. Clements said it could take a little while to settle down from that feeling of “chaos.”
“It’s unfortunate that we had to do this so quickly after these tariffs, before they were negotiated and resolved,” Clements said.
‘Catch its breath’
State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, upon learning of the amended economic forecast figures, gave a reaction some Nebraskans might share: “Holy s—.”
He said his immediate thought was that if senators want to consider a pause in the multi-year lowering of the income tax rate for the highest earners and corporations, “it is there, ready to go.”
Pausing those rates at 4.99%, rather than going down to 3.99% by the start of 2027, could save nearly $500 million over the next biennium, according to a fiscal estimate for Brandt’s Legislative Bill 171.
“We could just stop it for a year or two to allow the state to catch its breath, and we can do that without increasing any taxes, no new taxes,” Brandt told the Nebraska Examiner.
Clements and von Gillern said they have no appetite for “pausing” income tax rates, which von Gillern said could lead to more harm. Opponents have said applicable Nebraskans are now expecting the 2023-enacted tax cuts and a change would equate to a tax increase for those folks.
“We know that the one thing we can do to improve our bottom line is to keep people here,” von Gillern said. “If we raise the income tax or pause the income tax cut, we’re going to continue to drive people off like we did for decades.”
LB 171 has not advanced from the Revenue Committee.

Sales taxes
Brandt also has LB 169 and LB 170, which would add a statewide sales tax to pop, candy and about 18 other goods or services, such as swimming pool cleaning and maintenance, dating services, chartered flights, lobbying and pet grooming. Taxes on cigarettes would also increase. 
Both bills have advanced from the Revenue Committee, as has LB 712 from State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward to increase taxes on vapes up to 40% wholesale.
Earlier on Friday lawmakers, in a 34-10 vote, lawmakers approved LB 9 from Hughes to increase taxes on alternative nicotine products, designed to automatically capture emerging tobacco products. A fiscal note estimates about $3 million for the next biennium.
Brandt called it a “test” as the body considers the broader sales tax and sin tax bills. He and von Gillern said the forecast could change the calculus.
“I think the body’s going to have to take those a little more seriously than they thought they were going to,” von Gillern said.
State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, a freshman member of the Appropriations Committee, did not vote to advance the mainline budget Thursday. She declined to vote “yes” or “no,” and it advanced 7-1 over the opposition of State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha.
Spivey said she is not a fan of the Brandt sales tax bills, which she said could disproportionately impact people from marginalized communities. She said the deficit and tax burden can’t continue to be put “on people that are struggling to make ends meet that we really need to address some of the larger ticket items that we know are actually causing the deficit.”
Other big-ticket items
Spivey said the forecast was not the news she and others were hoping for, but it was expected. She said difficult decisions are ahead and that senators need to take a different approach, such as revisiting expenditures for the new state prison, Perkins County Canal and income or property tax relief programs.

Cavanaugh and Spivey, among others, have said the deficit is self-inflicted and that future budget years look even worse. Spivey said senators must prioritize investments to grow the economy and provide a return on investment. That includes smart justice reform, she said.
“I think there needs to be some serious and deliberate conversations that we have to sit in and we cannot keep avoiding,” Spivey said.
Brandt, chair of the Legislature’s Natural Resources Committee, said cuts to the Perkins County Canal “ain’t going to happen.” 
“If we do that, it’s going to get ugly,” he said. “I’m not willing to do that.”
On Tuesday, while on a different Brandt bill to merge two state agencies and prioritize water resources, State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha sought to shrink the canal size, saving $61 million to $150 million. The $61 million effort failed 12-29. The $150 million effort failed 13-33.
Other reactions
Pillen, reflecting in a statement on the forecast, did not address a root cause of the revised forecast: volatility of $100 million less in individual income tax each of the next two years. Instead, he said the state had “a great opportunity to be strong fiscal conservatives.”
“I am looking forward to working with the Legislature to close the budget gap while delivering the property tax relief that Nebraskans expect and deserve,” Pillen said Friday.

Pillen’s original budget recommendations left $62.4 million in wiggle room for lawmakers, if all of his ideas and those from senators were adopted. That included investments in property tax relief being led by Hughes, which, for now, remain in the Education Committee.
One major item different from the Appropriations Committee budget and Pillen’s is increasing rather than cutting state funds to the University of Nebraska, a difference of about $46 million.
Rebecca Firestone, executive director of the OpenSky Policy Institute think tank, said it’s clear that the state will face “significant headwinds” for the budget but that lawmakers have options to ensure access to “critical state services.”
“Now is the time to consider making thoughtful choices about raising revenue in a fair and sustainable manner,” Firestone said in a statement. “We urge the Legislature to resist the temptation to balance the budget by making deep cuts to critical services like health care and education.”



How the forecasting board works
The Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board consists of nine members, five appointed by the Legislature’s Executive Board and four appointed by the governor. Members meet every February and October as well as each April in odd-numbered years. Additional meetings can be called by the board chair.
The Nebraska Department of Revenue and the Legislative Fiscal Office each give revenue estimates that help inform the board’s decision in crafting forecasts, including tax receipts. Economic tools are also used.
For each fiscal year, board members anonymously write projections for sales taxes, individual income taxes, corporate income taxes and miscellaneous taxes, informed by the estimates.
The values are collected and a range is created, as well as an average. A motion can be made for any final projection, which must receive five votes. The final projection must be approved, too.
The next forecasting board meeting is set for Oct. 31.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NEFAB-042525-meeting-1024x576.png,,,2025-04-26 07:00:15.662676

The Utah judge said the Utah Constitution gives “a direct command to the legislature to perform a single duty: establish and maintain the state’s education systems.’” The judge continued, “This clear expression of one duty — coupled with the absence of any general duty to provide for the education or intellectual improvement of Utahns — impliedly restricts the legislature from creating a publicly funded school or education program outside of the public school system.” In other words, Utah’s Legislature is restricted from using public funds to support any form of private education.
Of interest is the fact that every member of the Idaho Legislature was sent a “Legislative Alert” on the first day of the 2025 legislative session, warning that any scheme to use taxpayer money for private education would be violative of the Idaho Constitution in a number of respects. The alert was provided by The Committee to Protect and Preserve the Idaho Constitution, a group that participated in the successful lawsuit to overturn the restrictive initiative law enacted in 2021. 
The alert identified the same constitutional flaw focused upon by the Utah judge — that Idaho’s Constitution prohibits the funding of private and parochial education. That has been the law of Idaho ever since statehood in 1890.
The alert spelled out several other constitutional infirmities that any voucher scheme would entail, including a deliberate transgression of Idaho’s strong prohibition against state support for religious education, discrimination against rural kids and Idaho religions that don’t operate parochial schools, lack of accountability for taxpayer money expended on private schooling, and diminution of state money necessary to support Idaho’s public school system, which has been chronically underfunded for decades.
The Utah judge’s decision mentioned a number of other infirmities in the Utah law — private schools often exclude students with special needs, or condition admission upon adherence to certain religious beliefs, or fail to provide “free” schooling as constitutionally required for taxpayer-supported education. These flaws are also inherent in House Bill 93, the subsidy bill approved by the Legislature this year.
The Idaho Legislature was clearly warned of the serious constitutional problems with House Bill 93, which will subsidize private and parochial education to the tune of $50 million in just the first year. Yet, because of massive funding from out-of-state groups that are seeking to weaken public schools across the nation, a majority of our legislators cast aside the Constitution and passed the subsidy bill. The governor lacked the courage to veto the legislation, despite overwhelming public outcry against it. 
Now, as with the similar travesty in Utah, concerned Idahoans will have to resort to the courts in order to protect the wishes of Idaho’s constitutional drafters. Please stay tuned.

(Photo by Skórzewiak/stock.adobe.com)Maryland’s public pension, the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System (SRPS), is making strides to address the climate crisis, but it has more work to do.
The SRPS stewards the retirement savings of public sector workers in Maryland, and key to its role in providing a reliable retirement benefit is the system’s ability to anticipate and manage climate change’s sweeping economic impacts. In late 2024, the SRPS created a Climate Advisory Panel to bring in climate experts, which shows great promise for a comprehensive climate strategy.
But SRPS must not wait to adopt well-established practices. In particular, SRPS’s proxy voting guidelines, the policy that establishes how it will vote on key issues at shareholder meetings, need to align with the urgency of the climate crisis and the financial risks of climate change.
Proxy voting guidelines allow pensions like SRPS to leverage its influence as investors by voting at the annual meetings of major corporations on key issues like climate disclosures, biodiversity protections and Indigenous rights. Right now, SRPS’s guidelines are missing language on climate risk, and the pension system is failing to support critical climate votes.

Strong proxy guidelines are a powerful tool to protect retirement savings while advocating for responsible corporate behavior. Maryland’s economy — and the retirement security of its thousands of public sector workers — depends on a stable climate, and SRPS has a responsibility to fully employ the tools at its disposal to address climate change.
SRPS Earned a “D” for Proxy Voting Performance
Despite its growing awareness of climate risk, Maryland’s pension system still lags in holding corporations accountable.
In a recent evaluation by the Sierra Club, Maryland earned a “D” for its proxy voting guidelines and 2024 voting record. The evaluation highlighted SRPS’s failure to support key shareholder resolutions on biodiversity and climate accountability. Additionally, SRPS missed critical opportunities to hold corporate directors responsible for misaligned business practices that exacerbate the climate crisis.
Proxy voting guidelines serve as a blueprint for defining responsible corporate behavior. Strengthening these policies would allow SRPS to better align its investments with Maryland’s climate goals and safeguard the retirement savings of public employees. As some of the largest shareholders in the country, public pensions like SRPS have the power — and the obligation — to push corporations to adopt sustainable business practices.
The Stakes for Maryland’s Economy and Workers
The financial risks of climate change are no longer theoretical. Extreme weather events, supply chain disruptions, and shifting energy markets create instability that threatens corporate profits and investors. When pensions ignore these investment risks, it jeopardizes the long-term returns that retirees depend on.
SRPS has already acknowledged these dangers and taken initial steps to assess climate-related financial risks. However, its weak proxy voting guidelines remain a critical gap in its overall strategy. Stronger guidelines would ensure that SRPS doesn’t just acknowledge climate risk — it is actively working to mitigate it.
As the impacts of climate change accelerate, SRPS must take a leadership role in pushing for meaningful change. Maryland’s climate goals are ambitious, but those efforts are undermined if our public pension fails to align its investment policies with our state climate targets.
Strengthening its proxy voting guidelines would allow SRPS to hold corporations accountable for their climate-wrecking behavior and incentivize a shift toward sustainable business practices. These actions would not only align our public pension’s investments with our state’s climate goals — it would also protect the financial future of our public sector workers and retirees.
A Call for Stronger Action
Maryland has an opportunity to lead by example. Strengthening SRPS’s proxy voting guidelines is a necessary and practical step toward protecting the retirement savings of thousands of public sector workers and fostering a thriving economy. By demanding that corporations act responsibly, Maryland can reduce climate risk, protect our public pension, and secure a sustainable future for all.
As the 2025 shareholder season approaches, all eyes are on SRPS. Public sector workers, environmental advocates, and communities will be watching to see whether the pension will rise to the challenge, or continue to lag behind.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AdobeStock_452740190-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-04-26 07:00:15.662676

(Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.












They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency




Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Matthew Perschall / Louisiana Illuminator)Amid discussions of splitting LSU’s top leadership role into two positions, System President William Tate is moving his office to the same campus building that once held the school chancellor’s office. 
LSU Board of Supervisors members Collis Temple Jr. and Rémy Starns confirmed to the Illuminator there have been discussions about splitting the two jobs, though board action has not been scheduled. 
When asked about the proposal after the supervisors’ meeting Friday, Chairman Scott Ballard said the proposal was “not on my agenda.” 

“I don’t think we’ll ever do that,” Ballard said. 
The system president and chancellor roles were merged into one post in 2012, after which the joint office-holder began working out of the University Administration Building on West Lakeshore Drive. Tate will move into offices at David Boyd Hall, a building near Memorial Tower on campus that housed the chancellor’s office before the positions were merged. Tate’s staff and some other workers currently based at the University Administration Building, including employees in the general counsel’s office, will also make the move. 
“We’re going to go back to that tradition,” said LSU chief of staff Ashley Arceneaux, Tate’s top aide. 
Arceneaux said the move does not indicate splitting the roles is imminent and Tate will still maintain an office in the University Administration Building. 
“That’s always been a conversation,” Arceneaux said of splitting the roles. “A change like that would be a long-term change, and so I think there would have to be a lot of discussion.”

This week, Illuminator reporter Wes Muller serves up details on restaurant reservation trading, a burgeoning digital industry that’s made a splash in big dining destinations such as New Orleans. Think of it as eBay, but for tables at high-demand spots. Winning bids have reached four figures just for seats – food not included.
But restaurants aren’t really embracing these apps, and Wes tells us why lawmakers are getting behind a proposal to place some restrictions on them.
Wes also caught up with Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple to get the skinny on why he and Gov. Jeff Landry have seemingly been at odds over their respective proposals to bring down auto insurance rates. They actually have some common ground, but it’s clear a political fence needs to be mended.
Finally, we hear from one of our fellow reporters from the States Newsroom network: Jackie Llanos of the Florida Phoenix. She broke a story that went viral a week ago when police in her state arrested a U.S.-born Georgia man under a Florida law that forbids immigrants without legal status from entering the state.
Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez was held in jail even after providing with his Real ID and a birth certificate that he’s an American. The judge said she was obligated to keep him in custody for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Jackie followed Juan Carlos’ case alongside his family, as they feared the worst.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Harvard University took the extraordinary step of suing the Trump administration on April 21, 2025, claiming that the pressure campaign mounted on the school by the president and his Cabinet to force viewpoint diversity on campus violated the Constitution’s guarantees of free speech.
“Defendants’ actions are unlawful,” Harvard’s lawsuit states. “The First Amendment does not permit the Government to ‘interfere with private actors’ speech to advance its own vision of ideological balance.’”
Yet in his first term, President Donald J. Trump declared that free speech mattered.
Trump issued the “Executive Order Restoring Free Speech and Ending Federal Censorship” on March 21, 2019. In it, he expressed the importance of free inquiry and open debate to education and directed federal officials to use the federal government’s funding of higher education to ensure that universities promote free inquiry.
Channeling free-speech champions Benjamin Franklin and James Madison, Trump wrote that “free inquiry is an essential feature of our Nation’s democracy.”
As a professor of constitutional, criminal and comparative law, and as a citizen who enjoys his liberty, I agree.
Free speech is fundamental to human progress. Scientific, medical, technological and social advancements all rely on the free flow of information. Robust discussion and disagreement are equally important to maintaining a healthy constitutional republic.
In the words of the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.”
The First Amendment’s free speech and press clauses protect all forms of expression – oral, print, digital and artistic – from governmental interference or punishment.
Of the many types of speech, political speech is the most protected.
On the first day of his second term in office, Trump issued another free speech executive order. It affirms the administration’s commitment to free speech, directs that tax money is not used to abridge free speech and instructs federal employees to “identify and take appropriate action to correct past misconduct by the Federal Government related to censorship of protected speech.”
In a vacuum, Trump’s orders appear to bode well for free speech.
But what is important is free speech reality, not rhetoric. Three months into his second term, where does Trump stand?
The many interconnected orders, letters, statements and actions of Trump’s White House make an assessment of any positive effects difficult. On the other hand, the Trump administration has clearly violated and chilled free speech on many occasions.
 
Repression and retaliation
Attempts to silence the president’s adversaries are developing as a pattern.
Law firms and attorneys who have sued or prosecuted Trump, or represented his adversaries, have been targeted for retribution and concessions. It began with an executive order on March 6, 2025, directed at the U.S.-based global law firm Perkins Coie, which had once represented Trump’s opponent in the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton. A second order was issued on March 14, 2025, against Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison because it once employed an attorney who investigated Trump. Subsequently, at least six other prominent law firms were also targeted.
Several law firms acceded to the president’s demands, agreeing to accept clients without regard to political beliefs, to eliminate DEI practices, and to perform pro bono work valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars for causes Trump supports.
The firms that didn’t accede to the president’s demands had their security clearances removed, access to federal buildings restricted, and were banned from working for federal agencies. A few of the firms that didn’t relent have won temporary injunctions barring the administration’s actions against them.
The nonpartisan free speech advocacy organization Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression decried the orders as threatening the foundations of justice and free speech. In one of several challenges to these orders, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell wrote on March 12, 2025, that Trump’s order appeared motivated by “retaliatory animus” and concluded that it “runs head on into the wall of First Amendment protections.” Two other federal courts reached similar conclusions.
In the first three months of his second term, Trump withdrew Secret Service protection of several prominent critics who are former federal government officials, including John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, his top aide, Brian Hook, and former high-level health official Anthony Fauci also lost their security protection.
It is hard to imagine that these decisions won’t have a profoundly chilling effect on potential critics of the president, especially since the revocations were publicly announced and each individual has been the subject of credible threats resulting from their governmental service.
 
Targeting the press
A similar pattern exists for journalists, where Trump is using his power to punish organizations whose reporting he doesn’t like.
AP journalists were banned from the White House and Air Force One on Feb. 11, 2025, for refusing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, the new name Trump had ordered for the body of water. On April 9, 2025, this ban was found to violate the First Amendment by a judge nominated by Trump during his first term.
Denouncing CNN and MSNBC as “illegal” and claiming they are paid political operatives, Trump suggested they should be investigated during a speech at the U.S. Department of Justice.
Trump effectively closed Voice of America, after 83 years of continuous broadcasting, for being “anti-Trump” and radical in its views. By charter, the broadcaster represents “America, not any single segment of American society,” with “accurate, objective, and comprehensive” news and “a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions” through television, radio, internet, social media and satellite broadcasts to peoples around the world.
The Federal Communications Commission has initiated regulatory actions against the licenses of several television stations for broadcasts that have been accused by the President of being anti-Trump or biased in favor of Kamala Harris. Early in the process, the outcomes of these actions are to be determined.
 
Pressuring universities and students

Other administration actions, I believe, raise serious free speech issues.
Harvard isn’t the only university feeling pressure.
The administration is threatening to withhold federal money from universities as a way to coerce many of them to comply with administration policies in ways that implicate free speech and in some instances violate legal processes for the withholding of federal support.
Some of the Trump administration’s recent immigration enforcement efforts have targeted international students who are in the U.S. lawfully but who participated in Palestinian rights protests and disagreed with  Israel’s actions during the war in Gaza.
The administration claims that some students whose visas have been revoked were either Hamas supporters or violated criminal laws. The administration has also said that many students are being deported under broad authority the secretary of state has to deport those deemed a danger to national security.
 
Democracy and free speech
In the past decade, the U.S. has fallen in press freedom, rule of law and democratic governance, resulting in the classification of a “flawed democracy” by the Economist Intelligence Unit, a democratic watchdog. Unsurprisingly, there has been a simultaneous rise in public support for authoritarianism. These changes make support for free speech increasingly important.
On March 4, 2025, Trump declared in a speech before a joint session of Congress that he “stopped all government censorship and brought free speech back to America.”
The record doesn’t support this claim.

Photo courtesy of National Medical AssociationLos Angeles pediatrician and urgent care specialist Dr. Ilan Shapiro worries for his chronically ill patients as he watches Congress weigh significant cuts to Medicaid.
He thinks of a boy who, before finding Shapiro’s clinic, was in and out of emergency rooms and intensive care units because of severe asthma attacks, instead of competing in soccer games and studying for exams. The boy’s parents were losing hours and pay at work with the frequent ER visits.
Shapiro, who is Latino, works at a federally qualified health care center, a clinic for low-income patients. Most of his patients are people of color on Medicaid, and roughly a quarter of them are children.
Research shows Latino and Black family physicians are more likely to see Medicaid patients compared with their white and Asian counterparts. Experts say the Medicaid cuts Congress is weighing would strap health care centers that rely on already-low Medicaid reimbursements, disproportionately affecting communities of color and the physicians they rely on.




It’s not just health insurance. It’s a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.


– Dr. Ilan Shapiro



Of the 72 million people covered by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities, more than half are people of color, with Black and Hispanic people disproportionately represented on the rolls.
Black and Hispanic patients have a higher risk of conditions such as high blood pressure, kidney disease and certain cancers, making health care access crucial.
Congressional Republicans are considering $880 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid spending to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. Conservatives have long argued that Medicaid is too expensive. They assert its expansion under the Affordable Care Act to more working adults has diverted too much money toward nondisabled people, taking resources away from vulnerable populations the program was originally intended to help.
But clinicians and policy analysts say the federal Medicaid cuts could have an especially detrimental impact on vulnerable enrollees, including children, older adults and people with disabilities or chronic illnesses, as states are forced to find savings to fill the gap.
Black maternal health advocates, researchers press on amid federal funding cuts
One GOP proposal targeting Medicaid expansion could lead to reductions in children’s health insurance programs, according to a February report by the Urban Institute. The think tank estimates that proposed cuts to federal Medicaid expansion spending could increase the number of uninsured kids by 11.8%.
“I’m deeply afraid,” said Shapiro. “It’s not just health insurance. It’s a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.”
Bias and language barriers
Just 6% of U.S. physicians are Latino and 5% are Black, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Sustaining the relatively few medical practices with Black and Hispanic providers is important amid evidence that racial bias, lack of access to culturally competent care and language barriers lead to poorer health outcomes or access.
For example, analyses have shown Black patients are less likely to be prescribed pain medication, and some clinicians hold false ideas that Black patients have a higher pain tolerance. Nearly 1 in 3 Black, Hispanic and multiracial women reported mistreatment in medical settings during pregnancy and delivery, such as receiving no help when asking for it or being shouted at, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.
Language barriers, which Latino communities are more likely to face, are also associated with poorer health or limited access to health care.
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.
“We understand the language and cultural concordance and the improved outcomes,” said Dr. Linda Mirdamadi, an adjunct clinical assistant professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine who serves on the National Hispanic Medical Association’s board of directors. “There’s a sense of trust.”
Mirdamadi said federal cuts to Medicaid would lead to loss of preventive care for her large, diverse community.
“If they don’t have access to health care, they’re not going to have the access to chronic disease prevention, to vaccines, to cancer prevention screening,” she said. “It is going to just increase the disparity gaps that already exist.”
‘Ripple effect’
Dr. Roger Mitchell, president-elect of the National Medical Association, which represents Black physicians, said a widespread loss of Medicaid coverage would affect everybody, even people with private insurance. People without health coverage often don’t have primary doctors and forgo preventive care, resulting in more trips to the emergency room. That can lead to longer wait times at ERs for everyone, regardless of their health insurance.
Mitchell also pointed out that Medicaid reimbursements are a major funding stream for hospitals and clinics that see a lot of enrollees. Without that money, many of those providers might be forced to scale back their services or close.
“The ripple effect is enormous,” said Mitchell, who heads Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C., where about 40% of patients are covered by Medicaid. “This is an issue that’s not just affecting one portion of the U.S. populace, but all of us, and has the potential to have huge harm.”
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes
Dr. Zita Magloire is a family physician, but she also offers obstetric care along with two OB-GYNs at Cairo Medical Care in the south Georgia city of Cairo. The city is the county seat of Grady County, which has about 26,000 residents, almost 30% of whom are Black.
Her practice is one of the few in the area that takes Medicaid for obstetric care, she noted, and serves many Central American immigrant patients who drive from the surrounding rural areas to her clinic. When another practice in the area started cutting services, her center absorbed those patients.
“There’s not a lot of providers that accept Medicaid,” she said. “What does that look like? Well, they [patients] show up with no prenatal care — and then, you have very high-risk patients.”
Back in Los Angeles, the boy whose family found Shapiro’s clinic is now a teenager. He received stable asthma care there and got Medicaid coverage.
“He started having a medical home. Everything changed. The ER visits and the intensive care unit visits changed to soccer games,” Shapiro said. Having coverage, he continued, “makes a huge impact for the entire community.”

(Photo provided by Diane Carpenter to Carolyn Kozak Loeffler, published with Carpenter family permission)Last month, five large boxes were hand-carried from Alamos, Mexico, across the U.S.-Mexico border to Tucson, Arizona. There, at the local UPS store, they were reboxed before I received the phone call I had been looking forward to for over a year: “They’re ready to ship.” 
These boxes, containing over 600 documents covering nearly 35 different subjects related to the economic and social development of early statehood and rural Alaska, are the personal historical archive of Diane Carpenter — a former longtime resident of Bethel, educator, public servant, bush pilot, mother, community organizer, social activist and significant shaper of Alaska’s early statehood years. 
Although most people outside of the Bethel region have never heard her name, Diane Carpenter’s contributions to Alaska — especially to the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta — were immense. The arrival of her collection back in Alaska was six years in the making and made possible by a dedicated team of friends and family in both Alaska and Mexico, and of course, by Diane herself. 
I first encountered Diane’s name while conducting research for Gwen Holdmann, founding director and chief scientist at the Alaska Center for Energy and Power — an applied research group at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Gwen was interested in the work, politics, and people involved in the formation of the Alaska Village Electric Cooperative — a cooperative utility unlike any other in existence. Although the early years of the organization were well documented in the literature, there was almost nothing published about how the organization came to be incorporated back in 1968. AVEC currently serves 59 remote community microgrids in a geographic region larger than any other cooperative utility in the world. 
Most cooperative utilities interconnect their customers through a common transmission network. That was not possible for AVEC due to the immense geographic distances involved. Instead, AVEC owns and operates individual powerhouses and distribution systems in each of these nonroad-connected communities and has been able to navigate operational challenges thanks in no small part to the work of the founders of the organization in formulating the innovative structure and culture that continues to define AVEC today.
Early in January 2024, I was pouring over AVEC-related materials at the Alaska and Polar Regions Collections and Archives at the Elmer E. Rasmuson Library when I came across a letter Diane had written in 1967 addressed to Richard Hausler, a deputy administrator for the Rural Electrification Administration in Washington, D.C. In the letter, she provided comprehensive feedback on a preliminary plan to electrify rural Alaska. Her language was powerful; her understanding of and advocacy for rural Alaska was deep. “The report did not state how much Native people themselves would be involved in the organization and operation of the cooperative,” she writes. “Many of the Native people are beginning to resent their having little or no say regarding programs that affect them; no matter how good the program is, they feel – quite rightly, I think – that their views should be heard and considered.”
She goes on to discuss the organizational structure, local involvement and empowerment, training needs, and much more to create the rural utility that would eventually become AVEC. She closes by saying, “There is no question but that these efforts are worthwhile. My husband and I will be most happy to help further them in any way we can. Best regards. Sincerely yours, Diane Carpenter. Stony River.”

	At this time, the vast majority of remote and rural communities did not have electricity due to many geographic, economic and political challenges. Lack of power service severely limited economic opportunities for rural Alaska residents. Despite many individual community efforts to apply for federal electrification funding, their applications were denied, often citing the enormous construction costs and lack of local economy to repay the loan and pay for continued service.
“Who is this woman?” I asked myself. Mind you, in 1967 the Civil Rights Act was only three years old, race riots occurred in cities throughout the U.S., and women faced legal discrimination in trying to open could be denied were unable to open their own bank accounts for another seven years. 
With the assistance from the archivist, I made a hasty scan of the letter and sent it to Gwen, who then searched online, found Diane’s memoir “In the Winter of the Orange Snow,” bought it in town the next day, and read it. Late the next night, I received this text from Gwen, “This woman’s life was insane.” Gwen meant that in the best way possible, as she herself is no stranger to outdoor adventure and innovative problem-solving while rearing a young family.
We reached out to Diane’s publisher the next morning and were delighted to learn that not only was Diane still alive at the age of 92, but she was working on a second memoir – this one covering the years she homesteaded in Stony River – the years she formed AVEC. The publisher connected us with Diane directly and she graciously agreed to meet virtually from her home in Alamos, Mexico.

	In our first meeting with Diane and her team of supporters, we learned that not only was Diane still an articulate champion of rural Alaska, but she kept meticulous records from her years in the Y-K Delta. Her personal archive captures both her individual perspective of living in rural midcentury Alaska, and also a bigger historical moment in time for our state: A transitional period between achieving statehood, statebuilding and the formal discovery of oil on the North Slope, the development of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System and the subsequent oil wealth that has defined so much of our state’s economy ever since. 
Diane had been working closely with the library in Bethel as well as other close friends and contacts in Alaska on finding a permanent home for her archive where it could be digitized and made accessible to all. Gwen and I both felt strongly about supporting the project however we could, and over the next year, constructed a plan in partnership with Diane, her team in Alaska and Mexico, and the Alaska and Polar Regions Collections and Archives at the UAF Elmer E. Rasmuson Library.
During this time, we had the pleasure of getting to know bits and pieces of Diane’s larger life story. Diane, an expert community organizer, was instrumental in the creation of many valuable programs in service to Alaskans and especially Alaskan women, including the Tundra Women’s Coalition in Bethel. But it was her work coordinating the regional, state, and federal effort that resulted in the successful organization we now know today as AVEC that she was most proud of. Through grassroots local organizing, the pooling of resources, substantial state and federal agency cooperation, and the construction of a thoughtful, deliberate organizational structure to foster community buy-in, Diane and her collaborators created a lasting and innovative utility structure that provided essential power services to communities across Alaska when no one else would. Willie Hensley served as AVEC’s founding president. Diane was VP.
When recently asked why she became so involved in early rural electrification efforts, Diane was quiet and reflective for a moment before replying, “Because I could… and if I didn’t, who would?” In interviews, it is clear that Diane’s deep affection and respect for the communities, families, and people of Western Alaska motivated her work. Her memoir and personal stories time and again tell of a need brought forth by the community and Diane rising and organizing to meet it. She led the incorporation of townships in order to create local schools so school-aged children could stay in their villages; coordinated the construction of powerhouses and airstrips; she founded women’s shelters and safe houses; and she advocated and organized for more equitable health and safety services for rural communities, just to name a few.
After a long battle with cancer, Diane passed away peacefully at home in Alamos last month surrounded by her family and friends. Her story exemplifies both the can-do spirit of the time as well as her own dogged determination and work ethic. Diane accomplished so much in her lifetime, but perhaps her most impactful legacy for current and future generations is her lived example of the power we each have to organize the meaningful and lasting investments we want in our own communities — that collaborative innovation, determination and political will can overcome seemingly impossible challenges. 
Diane’s archive is currently being digitized and processed, but should be available to the public for research within the next 12 months.

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025Federal agents were already investigating a secretive state vendor for legislative mailers in May 2020 when Tennessee’s director of legislative administration found out a scandal-ridden staffer was running the company.
Now-retired director Connie Ridley testified Friday in U.S. District Court she was “advised” by the U.S. Department of Justice to keep processing invoices because of a federal investigation into Phoenix Solutions, a company run by ex-staff member Cade Cothren.
Testifying Friday on the fourth day of the corruption trial for former House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff Cothren, Ridley said she wouldn’t have approved New Mexico-based Phoenix Solutions as a state vendor if she had known Cothren was behind it.
In the wake of his involvement in a sexist and racist texting scandal that led to his resignation and Casada’s decision to step down in August 2019, Ridley said she had no confidence in Cothren and his judgment. 
Casada, Cothren and former Rep. Robin Smith of Hixson were indicted on federal charges in 2022 in connection with an alleged fraud, bribery, theft and money laundering scheme involving the state’s postage and printing program for lawmakers, in which they’re allowed to use state funds to pay for information mailers to constituents. House members receive $3,000 annually and senators $8,000 because their districts are larger.
The prosecution introduced documents showing Cothren, using the alias Matthew Phoenix, formed Phoenix Solutions in December 2019, about three months after he left the Speaker’s office. Smith and Casada allegedly directed business to Cothren in return for kickbacks.

Ridley said Smith, who resigned, pleaded guilty and is cooperating with federal authorities, pressured her to make payments to Phoenix Solutions when it filed invoices for work on constituent mailers for former Rep. Patsy Hazlewood and current Reps. Jay Reedy, Paul Sherrell and Esther Helton-Haynes, all of whom are Republican.
Ridley said she initially declined to process the invoices because Phoenix Solutions hadn’t filled out a federal W-9 tax form. 
Prosecutors displayed the IRS tax form, which was filled out under penalty of perjury, showing the signature of “Matthew Phoenix,” the bogus name used by Cothren to hide his identity. Prosecutors say Casada and Smith had to hide Cothren’s name or lawmakers wouldn’t have used the company.
Federal attorneys also showed canceled checks to Phoenix Solutions with Cothren’s signature.
Defense attorneys have admitted that Cothren was “Matthew Phoenix” and that he had to keep his identity secret or he wouldn’t have been able to conduct state business.
Ridley acknowledged she approved Phoenix Solutions as a vendor once it filed the W-9 form. She also required the same for Smith’s company, Rivers Edge Alliance, and Casada’s company, Right Way Consulting and eventually set up direct deposit into bank accounts. 
Most of those invoices from December 2019 through mid-2020 ranged from about $2,500 to $4,500. The total amount involved in the case is $52,000.

Defense attorneys said in their opening statements that federal investigators took aim at Cothren because of his indiscretions as chief of staff, believing he had to be guilty of running an illicit company because he was a “sinner.”
Ridley, who had discretion to approve vendors, said rules for lawmakers’ constituent mailers changed in mid-2020 when questions were being raised about Phoenix Solutions. The House Speaker’s office also had final approval on the mailers to make sure they met state guidelines.
The former director said she got “pushback” from Smith because of the rules, in addition to pressure to pay Phoenix Solutions.
At one point, Ridley said, Smith told her it was a “poor reflection on the state” for Phoenix Solutions not to be paid.
Prosecutors showed an email to Ridley from Smith saying it would be “illegal or unethical” to print and send out mailers without knowing payment was coming.
One email from Matthew Phoenix to a bogus assistant, Candice McKay, said it seemed as if the state’s Legislative Administration Office was “having some drama” and added Tennessee is “not the easiest state to work with.”
In response to cross examination from Cothren’s legal team, Ridley said she had concerns about approving Phoenix Solutions and both Casada’s and Smith’s companies as vendors and that she took her concerns to House Speaker Cameron Sexton. 
“I felt it was a conflict of interest for sitting members of the General Assembly to sell services to other members,” she said. 
Ridley said she did not share her concerns with either Casada or Smith and ultimately, senior staff members for Sexton directed her to pay the invoices for all three companies.

Don Bacon, R-Neb., confirmed Friday that he is considering retiring from Congress, although he is just coming off one of his best fundraising quarters.
Bacon told the Nebraska Examiner that the decision on whether to run for reelection next year will be a family decision, made this summer. 
“I prayed a lot before deciding to run last cycle,” Bacon said. “I’m doing the same now.”
 John Cavanaugh exploring bid 

With the 2026 midterms only a year away, political groups from both sides of the aisle are pouring money and resources into Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District competitive seat. Bacon, who continues to be in the national spotlight as one of the few House Republicans to criticize the Trump administration, just had one of his best fundraising quarters. Now Bacon, 61, is poised to decide whether to pivot to private life. 
State Democrats, who view Bacon’s seat as vulnerable, are still looking for a candidate. However, State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha confirmed to the Examiner that he’s exploring a possible run for Nebraska’s 2nd District, regardless of Bacon’s decision to run or not. The Omaha state senator said he had made calls to feel out a potential run last week.

When asked how the calls went, Cavanaugh said, “Everyone likes me.”
“I am deeply concerned about the failure of the Congress to protect the interests of the people of Nebraska,” Cavanaugh said. “The people of Nebraska deserve a strong voice in Washington.”
He emphasized that he hasn’t made an official decision about running and that he has no set timeline. The last Democratic-aligned state senator, Tony Vargas, who ran against Bacon, has failed twice to unseat him. A Nebraska Democratic Party spokesperson said the party is still in talks with ”strong candidates” for the congressional district, and it will be up to the candidate to determine the timing of an announcement.
“If I am that voice, I will run regardless of who else is running,” Cavanaugh said. 
 Drawing attention

A potential midterm race is becoming clearer after independent Dan Osborn focuses his effort on the U.S. Senate once again. The Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District has already drawn attention from state and national Democrats this year, with Democrats leading in-person town halls and spending media ad buys from multiple Democratic-aligned groups. 
Bacon hauled in $910,000 in donations for the first quarter of fundraising for the year. A campaign spokesperson, Matthew Zacher, said Bacon is focused on ”governing and solving problems for his constituents.”
“This strong fundraising keeps all options open ahead of 2026,” Zacher said. 
The National Republican Congressional Committee flaunted House Republicans’ fundraising efforts for the first quarter, including Bacon. An NRCC spokesperson said Bacon’s “massive fundraising haul underscores how fired up voters are to send him back to Congress.”  
House Republicans who are considered in toss-up races have outpaced vulnerable House Democrats this fundraising cycle. Bacon’s fundraising is below the average of other Republicans considered to be in toss-up districts or learning Republican, according to Roll Call. 
The average for those House Republicans was $977,000.
 Bucked ‘blue dot’

The 2nd District saw roughly $21 million in spending from outside groups during the Bacon-Vargas 2024 race. The candidates raised a combined $10 million. 











This strong fundraising keeps all options open ahead of 2026.


– Matthew Zacher, Bacon spokesman



Bacon has fended off Democratic challengers in close races in previous years and has bucked the “blue dot” voting trend for Democrats in the last two presidential elections. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates Bacon’s seat as a Republican toss up.
“Don and Angie will make a decision on seeking another term in the coming months,”  Zacher said.

(Stock photo by Douglas Rissing via Getty Images)The Trump administration has lambasted the Washington attorney general’s lawsuit against a county for cooperating with federal immigration agents in violation of state law. 
The latest development, based on a court filing from the U.S. Department of Justice last week, marks another escalation of tensions between the state and feds over immigration. 
President Donald Trump’s Justice Department is asking a judge to side with Adams County as it faces litigation from Attorney General Nick Brown over the state’s “sanctuary” policy known as the Keep Washington Working Act. 
“Washington asserts KWW is lawful, because it does not ‘impede’ federal officials from accomplishing their work,” DOJ senior litigation counsel J. Max Weintraub wrote. “But that is exactly what KWW was designed to do. And it has accomplished that end — actively facilitating aliens’ evasion of federal law in Washington.”
Weintraub argues that the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, enacted by Congress, preempts the Keep Washington Working Act. And he points to the Constitution’s supremacy clause that holds federal statutes “shall be the supreme Law of the Land.”
“KWW contravenes the Supremacy Clause for a host of independent reasons, and virtually at every turn,” Weintraub wrote.
Brown’s lawsuit against Adams County has also received a stiff rebuke from Republican members of Congress, including Rep. Michael Baumgartner, whose eastern Washington district includes part of the county. 
In a letter, Baumgartner and two other Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee wrote the state “not only actively thwarts federal immigration enforcement, but it also targets local law enforcement officials for complying with federal law.” 
Brown defended the law in a sharply-worded response last week and questioned why his lawsuit was getting such national attention. 
Passed in 2019, the Keep Washington Working Act makes the state a so-called “sanctuary” for immigrants without legal status. President Donald Trump has floated punishing such cities and states, including through withheld federal funding. 
On Thursday, a federal judge in California blocked the Trump administration from taking that kind of recourse over immigration enforcement. Seattle, which has a sanctuary policy of its own, is one of more than a dozen local governments that brought the case.
The state law mostly stops local police from helping federal authorities with immigration enforcement. For example, police can’t provide nonpublic personal information to federal authorities investigating civil immigration cases, and can’t interview or detain people solely based on questions about their immigration status. 
Police also aren’t allowed to ask about their immigration status, except in rare cases.
In his lawsuit last month, Brown alleged the Adams County Sheriff’s Office flouted the law for years. He says deputies unlawfully jailed people based solely on immigration status, enabled federal immigration agents to question those in custody and shared confidential personal information of Washingtonians with federal officials.
In court filings, the county denied the state’s allegations, with arguments about the Keep Washington Working Act that mirror the DOJ. 
In a Friday statement, Brown said the DOJ and Adams County employ “the same factually and legally incorrect arguments.”
“There is no conflict between Keep Washington Working and federal law, and we look forward to continuing to present our case in court,” the attorney general continued.
The complaint, initially filed in state court in Spokane County, has been moved to federal court. The attorney general is looking to move it back to state court because the case is focused on allegations regarding state law, not federal.

U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., said he got confirmation Thursday from the White House that the administration will authorize two meteorologists next week for the NWS office, which will allow it to deploy weather balloons twice a day.

“They’re all smiles,” Flood said, referring to the Valley NWS officials. 
The announcement came after the Weather Service office for the Omaha area and other Great Plains offices announced that they would pause the deployment of weather balloons due to cuts from the Trump administration last month. Trump cut 1,000 jobs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, which includes the National Weather Service. 
Flood was among several in Nebraska’s federal delegation to push back against NWS DOGE cuts. U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressing his concern about the plan to lay off personnel at NOAA following the recent wave of deadly storms across the country, after telling the Examiner that he would “press the White House” to restore the Weather Service office’s ability to deploy weather balloons.
The rest of Nebraska’s all-GOP delegation expressed concerns about grounding the weather balloons. Flood said he wants to introduce legislation that would reclassify National Weather Service employees as public safety. 
“Had that been in place, this would never have gotten to the point it is,” Flood told the Examiner. 
Weather balloons are a key tool in forecasting. Midwestern meteorologists feared the data loss would have led to forecasting challenges. Flood also provided specifics on the NWS official staffing issues – the office typically has 13 meteorologists but was down to eight. 
Nebraska experienced a blizzard last month, which caused Gov. Jim Pillen to declare a state of emergency for 24 counties. The damage estimates from the blizzard are estimated to be more than $64.8 million. The governor is seeking federal disaster assistance from the Trump Administration, calling the winter storm “one of the most destructive winter weather events to impact Nebraska in recent history.”
Eric Hunt, an agricultural meteorologist with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, told Nebraska Public Media that the “worst-case scenario” involves forecasting accuracy returning to its 2000s levels because it would lead to shorter warning times for potential severe weather and less accurate long-term forecasts.

(Novagold Resources photo)For years, plans to develop Alaska’s largest gold prospect appeared to have stalled amid lawsuits and questions about costs. 
Now, a $1 billion deal could inject new life into the massive Donlin gold project in Western Alaska.
That’s the message, at least, from the investors who are doubling down on Donlin, including two prominent East Coast billionaires. They say they’re more motivated to push the project toward production than the global mining giant that just pulled out.
In a sale announced this week, Barrick Gold Corp., one of the world’s most prolific gold mining companies, will give up its half of Donlin. 
Paulson Advisers, a Florida-based firm led by financier John Paulson, is paying Barrick $800 million for 40% of the project. 
The remaining 10% will go to Novagold Resources for $200 million. Novagold is a publicly traded company that already owned half of the project and has been working on it alongside Barrick for years. 
Barrick, which operates gold and copper mines in the U.S., Africa, South America and the Middle East, brought deep pockets to Donlin, along with expertise as a developer. 
But the company also had competing priorities and wasn’t pressed to move Donlin from exploration into the multibillion-dollar construction phase, Novagold’s chairman, Thomas Kaplan, said at a briefing this week.
Donlin, which is one of the world’s largest gold prospects, is gaining deeper backing from Paulson, a longtime investor in the metal who already owned shares in Novagold. He says he’s poised to bring not only new cash to the project but also fresh intent to speed it along.

“Our goal is to immediately advance this project toward production,” Paulson said at the briefing. 
A coveted, contentious deposit
Donlin has been studied for years and Novagold estimates that it contains deposits of gold worth more than $100 billion. Boosters consider the project to be one of Alaska’s most promising deposits, given its sheer size. But it’s also one of the most contentious. 
Its developers enjoy considerable support from elected officials and Alaska Native-owned corporations, which own the land where Donlin sits. They see the project as an opportunity to create hundreds of jobs and generate revenue for local governments and Indigenous shareholders. 
But Donlin faces staunch opposition from several tribal governments as well as regional and statewide conservation groups. They fear the effects of a large-scale mine in a remote region where people have long depended on salmon and other wildlife and traditional foods. 
Paulson’s investment comes as four separate lawsuits over Donlin’s state and federal permits work their way through the courts — and as questions linger about the economics and logistics of powering a sprawling, open-pit operation. The mine would be built on tundra near the upper reaches of the Kuskokwim River, far from existing roads and the electricity grid.

	Donlin is almost fully permitted but has not moved into construction in part, according to its new owners, because Novagold and Barrick weren’t aligned on how quickly to proceed. 
Traditionally a gold company, Barrick has recently shifted its focus to copper — a key component for electric cars and other modern technologies that some investors consider a more strategic, long-term bet. Barrick has appeared more interested in developing copper mines in other countries than in advancing Donlin, according to industry observers.
“I think what held (Donlin) back in the past was Barrick, through no fault of their own,” Paulson said. “They had many projects around the world. And Donlin was somewhat of an orphan asset.” 
Market analysts at Jefferies, a New York investment bank, echoed Paulson in their own review of the deal. 
“From what we could tell, Donlin was not a priority in Barrick’s portfolio — not anytime soon, anyway — and so we are not surprised by the sale,” the review said.
The analysts added, however, that the deal appears to have come at the right time for Barrick because of rising gold prices — which likely boosted Donlin’s value. 
Gold has hit repeated record-high prices in recent months and is now selling at more than $3,300 per ounce, up some 30% this year.
Barrick appears poised to use cash from the sale to invest in its other mines. In a press release, the company’s chief executive, Mark Bristow, said Donlin “might be better suited in the hands of others, while we pursue our priority portfolio of Barrick-managed growth projects.”
A Barrick spokesperson declined to comment further. 
Kaplan, Novagold’s chairman, said he harbors no ill will toward Barrick and looks forward to celebrating the Donlin deal with Bristow “over a bottle or two or three of very, very fine Bordeaux.” He also said at the briefing, perhaps jokingly, that he almost named one of his children Donlin.

	Kaplan himself is a billionaire investor, who, like Paulson, has long been known for his enthusiasm for gold. His firm, The Electrum Group, invested in Novagold over a decade ago and is now the company’s largest shareholder. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Kaplan made multiple attempts to buy Barrick’s half of Donlin over the past 15 years.
“Donlin for me was the Holy Grail,” Kaplan told the Journal.
Novagold’s stock has jumped nearly 60% since the sale was announced, in a sign that investors view it as a good deal. 
Along the Kuskokwim River, downstream of the Donlin prospect and thousands of miles from Wall Street, the deal elicited a range of opinions. Some said they hadn’t heard about the project’s change in ownership. Others said it made no difference to their opposition.
“It’s scary and frustrating,” said Beverly Hoffman, an elder in Bethel, a Kuskokwim River town and regional hub. As someone who “depends on the food resources to sustain our way of life,” Hoffman said in a phone interview, “it angers me that this money can just be thrown around.”

	Hoffman co-founded Mother Kuskokwim Tribal Coalition, a regional advocacy group that’s fighting Donlin. She said she’d like Paulson, the investor, to come visit her in Bethel. 
“I’ll take him out in a boat,” she said. “I would love to talk salmon with him. I would love to talk birds and berries.”
Like many Bethel residents, Hoffman is a shareholder of the regional, Indigenous-owned company Calista Corp., which owns rights to the minerals at Donlin. 
The corporation, which selected those lands for their mineral potential under the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, has strongly supported Donlin, given its potential to pay royalties to Calista and create jobs for shareholders.
“Although there’s this news about a planned ownership change, our vision and our priorities at Calista have not changed,” said Vice President of Corporate Affairs Thom Leonard.
Calista periodically meets with Donlin’s owners, has had a “very positive” history with Novagold and doesn’t expect that to change, Leonard added. “We’re ready to move forward when it’s proven and we believe that it’s safe to do so.” 
A politically connected investor
It still might be too early to say exactly how the sale will affect the mine’s prospects, according to Brett Watson, an economist at the University of Alaska Anchorage who follows the industry closely. 
Watson is waiting to see what changes Novagold and Paulson make to Donlin’s operations this year, and how quickly the owners move to update their economic analysis of the project. 
Before Barrick’s sale, Donlin had announced plans to spend $43 million on exploratory drilling and other operations this year.
As soon as the deal closes, the new ownership team aims to begin a key step toward construction: an $80 million, two-year update of an existing economic study of Donlin, said Novagold’s chief executive, Greg Lang. 
Donlin is already halfway done with its planned drilling for the year, he added. Once the sale is finalized, Lang said in an interview, Novagold and Paulson will look to expand Donlin’s budget, “if appropriate.”

	Paulson originally gained fame by making billions of dollars in a bet against the U.S. housing market leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.
Since then, Paulson has poured large sums into mining, becoming one of the country’s highest-profile gold investors. 
His firm holds a roughly 35% stake in Perpetua Resources, which is building a large mine in Idaho with support from the Trump administration. That project targets gold and antimony — an element that’s surged in value amid a trade war with China — and it recently has progressed quickly from the study phase toward construction.
“We want to repeat that success we’ve had with Perpetua, with Donlin,” Paulson said. “It was a similar mine development as we have here. Only Donlin is much larger.” 
Paulson & Co., Paulson’s family investment office, has other mining interests in Alaska, though the billionaire has largely stayed behind the scenes. 
They include a one-third stake in International Tower Hill Mines, a small company looking to develop a gold deposit north of Fairbanks. The firm also owns nearly 9% of Trilogy Metals, which is seeking to build a copper mine near the end of the controversial, state-proposed Ambler Road in remote Northwest Alaska.   
Beyond investing, Paulson is known for his ties to President Donald Trump. He donated millions of dollars to Trump’s presidential campaign and hosted a fundraiser last year at his home in Palm Beach, Florida. He was floated last year as a potential U.S. treasury secretary pick. 
A spokesperson for Paulson referred a request for comment to Novagold.

Lawmakers double budget for correction ombuds
Democratic state lawmakers have nearly doubled the budget for the state’s new correction ombuds. While Governor Ned Lamont flat-funded the office at $400,000 annually — an amount that both members of the Correction Advisory Committee and Interim Ombuds DeVaughn Ward have said is not nearly enough to perform the ombuds’ necessary duties — including responding to complaints and visiting prison facilities.
Ward told the Committee at a meeting in February that he planned to ask lawmakers for a budget of around $800,000.
The additional money — which increases the ombuds’ budget to a total of $790,800 in 2026 — includes funding for an advanced nurse practitioner, a special investigator, an assistant ombuds and an administrative assistant.
“ That one person [the ombuds] can’t possibly go to the 13 correctional facilities that we have and deal with the number of complaints or concerns that people may have,” Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, told lawmakers at a meeting on Tuesday.

Advocates voice concerns on special ed bills
Advocates for students with disabilities say they’re deeply concerned with some of the provisions in Senate Bill 1561 and House Bill 7277, controversial measures that have also been criticized by some lawmakers.
The legislation have numerous provisions that include changes to how private special education programs can bill for services and a requirement that the Office of Policy Management, along with the state Department of Education, create fixed costs for services for students that are outsourced to other school districts.
On Wednesday, the Connecticut Council of Administrators of Special Education and Special Education Equity for Kids of Connecticut came together to send a letter voicing their criticism to the lawmakers that have championed those bills. They said that the rate setting provisions in SB 1561 and HB 7277 have numerous flaws, including the short time frame of just six months for designing and implementing a rate setting system, as well as assigning that job to the Office of Policy Management, which they argue is not equipped with the educational expertise to take on this task. While the groups said they agree with some of the proposals, they believe the others would have a “devastating” impact on special education students.
The groups asked Gov. Ned Lamont to convene a Blue Ribbon Commission that would include parents, administrators, economists, and other experts to assess whether a rate-setting system is feasible, and, if so, detail recommendations for that system. The groups said that while they favor some aspects of the legislation, they requested to meet with lawmakers to work together to improve the proposed bills.

Work, live, ride
A bill known as Work, Live, Ride that would push towns to build more housing near train and bus stations passed the Appropriations Committee on Thursday. The legislation includes funding to increase staffing at the Office of Responsible Growth, which would be tasked with helping towns figure out their zoning and planning development.
Under the bill, certain funding for municipalities would be prioritized for towns that adopt zoning to increase residential density near public transit, a concept known as transit-oriented development.
Supporters say it would increase housing supply, which the state desperately needs, and benefit the environment by encouraging more people to use public transportation.
Opponents fear it would weaken local control and that the prioritization of funding would mean towns that don’t join the program would miss out on money they need for infrastructure projects.
The additional positions at the Office of Responsible Growth would mean the need for an appropriation of about $250,000 in the state budget, according to a fiscal analysis of the bill. It passed the committee with a 40-14 vote, and next heads to the House.

Public defender eligibility
Lawmakers and the governor appear to be at odds over who should be eligible for public defender services in the state.
In February, Lamont unveiled a budget that reduced eligibility for public defender services from 250 percent of the poverty level — $80,375 for a family of four — to 200 percent of the poverty level, or $64,300 for a family of four.
Lamont’s proposal would reverse the expansion that the legislature made in 2022, which has only just begun to take effect since January.
Deborah del Prete Sullivan, legal counsel for the Office of Public Defenders, said that before the increase in eligibility, even someone making minimum wage couldn’t qualify for public defender representation.
“These are not people who are making a lot of money at all,” del Prete Sullivan told the appropriations committee in February, just after the governor’s budget was unveiled.
The appropriations committee budget restores funding for 20 public defender positions originally removed from the governor’s budget. Del Prete Sullivan noted in February that the department had hired people to cover the anticipated increase in caseload, and that reducing the eligibility level would mean either having to lay people off or institute a hiring freeze.
Connecticut public defenders represented people in over 118,000 cases in 2024.

Free bus fare for high school students
The $55.7 billion two-year budget adopted by the legislature’s Appropriations Committee this week includes $3 million in both fiscal years 2026 and 2027 to provide free bus fare for high school students. The Transportation Committee also passed a separate measure to provide discounted and free bus rides to high school students as well as veterans. That proposal, which is not included in the version of the budget passed by the Appropriations Committee, requires the Department of Transportation to create a program allowing certain high school students to ride buses for free or discounted fares, as well as free bus fare to veterans.
“The [Transportation Committee] proposal is a recognition that these are two important groups of public transit riders and we need to support efforts to get them connected to places of work, education, recreation and home,” said Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, co-chair of the Transportation Committee. “I think the Appropriations package takes a significant step in supporting this effort.”

Riparian ‘buffer’ bill advances
The area around rivers, streams and wetlands known as the “riparian zone” would enjoy greater protections from development under a bill advanced by state lawmakers on Friday.
The legislation, House Bill 7174, gives the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, along with local wetlands commissions, the ability to regulate activities within a 100 foot buffer zone surrounding any waterway or wetland. Currently, those agencies only regulate activities within the boundary of the wetlands itself.
Proponents of the bill argue that it is necessary to help protect riparian areas from over development, which can have negative impacts on habitats, water quality and flood control.
“These buffer areas around streams help to alleviate some of the major flooding by controlling erosion, and fostering native soils,” said Rep. Brandon Chaffee, D-Middletown.
Critics, however, argued that the legislation amounted to massive expansion of those agencies’ regulatory powers.
Rep. Doug Dubitsky, R-Chaplin, proposed several amendments to the bill — some of which were technical in nature, and another that would have reduced the buffer zone to 10 feet — that were voted down by the majority Democrats on the Planning and Development Committee.
“There are better ways to ensure that we have clean water in this state, than to essentially take over large swaths of the land mass of this state,” Dubitsky said.
The bill makes several other minor changes to the powers held by local wetlands commissions, and allows the commissioner of DEEP to develop regulations for fish passageways at certain dams.
The Planning and Development Committee voted to advance the bill Friday, following similar approval by members of the Environment Committee. The bill now heads to the House for further consideration.

Vermont’s largest public transit agency is now, as a result, weighing new training for its bus drivers on how to interact with federal agents. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Feds threaten states’ transportation funding over noncompliance with immigration enforcement.","Green Mountain Transit buses drive down Main Street in Burlington on May 14, 2024. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerPresident Donald Trump’s administration on Thursday told states and other recipients of federal transportation funding that they could lose those dollars if they do not comply with the White House’s interpretation of federal laws — including on immigration.The guidance, outlined in a letter from U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, told recipients that their obligations, by taking federal funding, included “cooperating with and not impeding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” as well as other agencies, “in the enforcement of Federal immigration law.”Failing to do so would “compromise the safety and security of the transportation systems supported by DOT financial assistance,” the missive states, as well as “prioritize illegal aliens over the safety and welfare of the American people.” The four-page letter also takes aim at diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, calling them “discriminatory” and saying that states and others “must ensure that the personnel practices (including hiring, promotions, and terminations) within their organizations are merit-based and do not discriminate.”Duffy said, without providing specifics, that there had been instances in which recipients of federal funding did not cooperate with “ICE investigations,” and that some recipients had “issued driver’s licenses to individuals present in the United States in violation of Federal immigration law,” which he suggested would be grounds for losing federal dollars. Since 2014, Vermont has allowed people who live in the state — but who do not have lawful status or U.S. citizenship — to get “driver’s privilege” cards. It’s one of 19 states, along with Washington, D.C., that offer “driving privileges to unauthorized immigrants,” according to data compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures.Clayton Clark, general manager of Green Mountain Transit, outlines proposed reductions in local bus service at a public hearing in Burlington on Sept. 11, 2024. File photo by Shaun Robinson/VTDiggerVermont’s largest public transportation agency, Green Mountain Transit, funds about two-thirds of its operations with federal money and received the letter from Duffy on Thursday, said Clayton Clark, the agency’s general manager. Clark said the agency is, as a result, working on new training for what its drivers and other employees should do if federal immigration agents board a bus or come to one of the agency’s transit hubs in downtown Burlington or Montpelier. The state Agency of Transportation got the letter late Thursday, said Amy Tatko, an agency spokesperson, in an email Friday, and is in the process of reviewing it. In the state’s budget for the current fiscal year, which ends in June, federal funds make up almost 60% of transportation spending, according to the Legislature’s Joint Fiscal Office.Joe Flynn, the transportation secretary, said in a brief emailed statement that the letter “requires further understanding,” especially about the Trump administration’s intentions, but added the state agency is “not overly concerned at this time” about what it says.Clark said that Green Mountain Transit — which operates local and commuter bus services, as well as on-demand transit for people with certain medical needs, across Chittenden, Franklin, Grand Isle and Washington counties — would, broadly, tell its employees to comply with federal immigration enforcement officials. “We would not want them to interfere — but we also would not want them to, you know, be aiding,” Clark said. The agency’s staff has not had any such interactions with federal immigration enforcement so far, he said in an interview Friday morning. Still, Clark said he is concerned by the nature of recent detentions by federal agents in Vermont and other states that took place with little warning and were conducted by officers wearing plainclothes and masks. This could make it difficult, for instance, for the agency’s employees to get a clear sense of what was happening, Clark said. He noted that Green Mountain Transit’s No. 56 bus stops just down the street from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Colchester where Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian activist and lawful U.S. resident, was arrested earlier this month in that manner. Clark said he expects that some people use the No. 56 to get to appointments at that office. “When folks are not in uniform, not wearing any type of identification that would let you know what organization they’re from,” Clark said, “how do we know that this is ICE — and not somebody who’s, you know, trafficking New Americans?” Clark said he is concerned that the prospect of immigration enforcement raised by Duffy’s letter could discourage people from taking public transportation. But he said Green Mountain Transit could not afford to put its federal funding at risk, regardless of how he felt, personally, about this week’s federal guidance.He estimated that the agency, which is already facing steep financial challenges and has had to cut some services in recent months, would only be able to provide about 20% of the service that it currently offers if it were to lose all of its federal funding.Green Mountain Transit has already made one change to its operations in response to recent actions by the Trump administration, Clark said. After learning the administration could target federal funds used for what are — at least in the White House’s view — diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, Clark said, the transit agency pulled the plug on its “Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Committee” meant to ensure its services were meeting the needs of people from historically marginalized communities. The agency made the decision to disband the committee in March, Clark said. Trump has taken aim at what he considers “DEI” programs in government and the private sector from the outset of his second term. His billionaire adviser Elon Musk’s cost-cutting “government efficiency” department has, meanwhile, repeatedly targeted federal jobs for cuts that it has said were related to diversity and inclusion efforts. Clark said Green Mountain Transit plans to replace its “JEDI” committee with “rider engagement” committees, still aimed at soliciting feedback from its passengers.At the statewide level, the Trump administration earlier this year put federal grants for some major transportation projects under “review,” including large new bridges and a planned buildout of electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the state. During Gov. Phil Scott’s weekly press conference on Wednesday, Flynn, the transportation secretary, said in response to a question that the EV funding was the only pot of transportation money he knew of at that point that was still under threat.Sen. Richard Westman, R-Lamoille, who chairs the Senate Transportation Committee, said Friday that he was concerned by the position that the letter put the state in. He said it is difficult, if not impossible, to predict what steps the Trump administration will take, and noted the state’s transportation revenue challenges gave it little flexibility.“I wouldn’t want to comply,” he said, referring to the immigration enforcement described in Duffy’s memo, among other measures. “But I can’t afford to live without the money.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Feds threaten states’ transportation funding over noncompliance with immigration enforcement.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/buses-1-20240514.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-25 20:05:51.691968

(Courtesy of Ann Moylan Fiala, Ainsworth Volunteer Fire Department)A Friday morning update from Ainsworth Fire Chief Brad Fiala, shared through the local KBRB Radio station, indicates the north-central Nebraska Plum Creek Fire is up to 70% contained as crews continue to battle the fire west and north of Johnstown in Brown County.
The fire started Monday afternoon after a private landowner’s prescribed burn done in coordination with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, local fire departments and other partners escaped containment, according to local and state officials.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen issued a statewide burn ban Wednesday afternoon through the end of April, when the fire was 0% contained and 6,631 acres had been burned. By Thursday morning, the fire was 40% contained.
Game and Parks is enforcing a temporary campfire ban across its properties.
Many outside resources that were called to assist will depart the area Friday, according to Fiala’s update. The two UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters from the Nebraska National Guard that had been on scene will still make water drops on interior hot spots Friday.
“We are trying to work hot spots and smoldering areas now,” Fiala said in the update. “You are still going to see smoke in there for the next couple [of] weeks.”
Fiala said warmer temperatures and strong winds are expected to return to the area Sunday, which could complicate the response as crews continue fighting.
Landowners are encouraged to help local volunteer fire departments monitor the area. One cabin was destroyed and 45 cattle were killed, and a few people lost their deer stands. Crews have managed to save other houses and structures in the area.

CoreCivic, a private company that manages the Crossroads Correctional Center in Shelby, said Friday it will appeal the decision.
The victim, Nathaniel Lake, was convicted of a crime he maintained he did not commit, and he was transferred to CoreCivic’s prison in Shelby, according to a news release Friday from the law firm representing him, Heenan and Cook of Billings. The Montana Supreme Court later overturned that conviction.
“While there, Mr. Lake was assaulted by another inmate serving a double life sentence without parole for deliberate homicide who had previously assaulted 11 times,” the news release said.
The original complaint filed in Toole County District Court in December 2021 said CoreCivic had been named in multiple lawsuits around the country with allegations based on “inmate injuries and deaths inflicted by other inmates.”
The lawsuit said a 2016 U.S. Department of Justice audit found CoreCivic routinely had insufficient staffing.
It also said a 2021 presidential order prohibited the DOJ to renew contracts with private prison operators, including CoreCivic, “noting that such facilities do not provide safe living or working conditions” compared to publicly operated ones.
CoreCivic maintains it takes safety seriously. In January 2025, the Brennan Center for Justice said the Trump administration reversed the order against private prison contracts.
According to the news release, the assailant “buzzed” out of his own locked pod and into Lake’s locked pod in the 2018 attack.
“He then went to Mr. Lake’s cell and beat and choked him for over 3 1/2 minutes undetected by any jailers,” the news release said. “A jailer found Mr. Lake at lockdown count and he was life-flighted to a hospital in Great Falls.”
The complaint said the assailant moved quickly, “no CCC staff intervened in the attack on Lake,” and he was allowed to “freely roam the prison between units without staff intervention.”
Lake was in a coma for 33 days and spent four months in the ICU, the lawyers said. Lake is also represented by Bechtold Law in Missoula.
The complaint said Lake had a “significant history of mental health issues” and was designated as a sex offender at the time, which made him more vulnerable to an attack.
But it said Lake maintained his innocence of attempted sexual intercourse without consent, and the news release said the conviction didn’t stick.
After being released from the hospital, Lake returned to CoreCivic for six months, but was released when the Montana Supreme Court overturned his conviction.
The complaint said the Missoula County Attorney’s Office declined to refile charges, and Lake has no criminal record.
In a statement, lawyer John Heenan said the award delivers on the request of the team’s client. The lawyers said the jury found “deliberate indifference” on the part of CoreCivic.
“In the face of a company that flatly refused to accept any responsibility for its conduct, we told the jury that Mr. Lake didn’t want sympathy, he wanted justice,” Heenan said. “The jury resoundingly rejected CoreCivic’s excuses and delivered justice.”
Based in Tennessee, CoreCivic describes itself as one of the largest corrections operators in the country. In an email, spokesperson Ryan Gustin said CoreCivic will appeal the decision.
“We take the safety and well-being of every person in our care very seriously,” Gustin said. “We respectfully disagree with this decision, don’t believe it reflects the facts of the case, and will appeal it on several legal grounds.”
The complaint said the prisoner who assaulted Lake was criminally charged with two counts of aggravated assault, pleaded guilty to the first count, and was sentenced to 15 years at the Montana State Prison with no time suspended.
Lake suffered a traumatic brain injury under CoreCivic’s negligent supervision, which had severe and permanent consequences, the complaint said: “He will likely require care for the rest of his life.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-865986514-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-04-25 19:07:44.210515

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Although older teens could work unlimited hours, they wouldn’t be able to get treatment for sexually transmitted infections on their own under two bills the Florida House approved Friday.
House lawmakers voted on party lines both to require parental consent for health care providers to treat minors with STIs and to let 16- and 17-year-olds work full-time hours during the school year without their parents’ permission.
The passage of the bills rolling back child labor laws (HB 1225) and exceptions entitling minors to privacy with doctors (HB 1505) prompted ardent debate from Democrats, who raised concerns about children who may be too afraid to report abuse.
Orlando Democratic Rep. Rita Harris put forward a failed amendment allowing minors 16 and older to get treatment for STIs without parental consent.
“There is definitely space for people who are 16 or 17 to be able to make decisions on their own, as it was stated,” Harris said. “They drive a car. We trust them to get behind a car, which could literally kill people and kill themselves.”
It didn’t come up during Friday’s debate, but the legislation co-sponsored by Lake Mary Republican Rep. Rachel Plakon also would remove a “loophole” in Florida law that allows physicians to prescribe birth control to a minor if their medical opinion is that the patient would suffer health hazards otherwise.


Plakon said she wants parents to have greater involvement over their kids’ health decisions than institutions.
“The overwhelming majority of parents want to do the right thing for their children, and we believe that the passing of this legislation is a restoration of parental rights with health care and will foster better communication between parents and their children,” Plakon said. 
Parental consent doesn’t apply to minors whose parents are being investigated for a crime against them. The Senate version, SB 1288, has not been scheduled for a floor vote. 
Additionally, the change could come at a time when Florida teens are contracting chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis at the highest rates since 2008, according to 2023 data from the Florida Department of Health. Those infections can be cured with antibiotics, but worsen if left untreated.
Seventeen-year-old Adriana Rodas views the bills in juxtaposition to each other. The South Floridian traveled to Tallahassee in March to testify against HB 1505. 
“I think saying that [teens] are only old enough to do one thing, and that one thing also happens to benefit the people who want to make this legislation pass, is hypocritical because it just shows to me that they always say they care about children, but then when it comes to having them work longer hours, which deteriorates mental health and can really slow them down academically, they don’t care,” Rodas said in an interview with Florida Phoenix.

Repealing labor laws
Lawmakers then approved the bill loosening working laws for young Floridians, which Democrats decried as a chance for employers to exploit minors, by a vote of 78-30. 
Specifically, the bill would allow 16- and 17-year-olds to work shifts longer than eight hours on the day before a school day and more than 30 hours in a week while school is in session. The bill loosens restrictions for 14- and 15-year-old home-school students, online students, and those who’ve graduated. 
Employers wouldn’t have to give 30-minute breaks to older teens under the bill. 
“In Florida, we’re requiring parental rights for many other things, like field trips, school presentations, and even, previously, this bill that just moved, kids would need parental rights for STI treatment,” said Jacksonville Democratic Rep. Angie Nixon.
Florida now allows waivers signed by parents. guardians, or school superintendents for young people to work beyond restrictions spelled out in state law, but Republicans argued that the ultimate permission is granted by parents, and a waiver should not be required. 
Rep. Monique Miller, a Republican representing Palm Bay and the bill’s sponsor, said that, because of “a resurgence in apprenticeships and such, we want to reduce barriers to teenagers learning their trade.”
Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office drafted the legislation, Orlando Weekly reported.
The bill makes Florida’s minor labor laws stricter in one aspect. It was amended to prohibit students from working past 10 p.m. on school nights. Florida law now allows students to work until 11:00 p.m. 
The Senate version of the bill, SB 918, has not moved since its first committee stop, when it passed on a 5-4 vote. That bill, and the original version of the House bill, would’ve let minors work overnight on school nights. 
During its last committee stop, the bill was amended to speed up a preemption established last year, when lawmakers voted to eliminate local living-wage laws, specifically for government contractors, effective in 2026. The 2025 bill revises that preemption to take effect this year.

A diverse group of students testified before the House and Senate education committees Friday, singing the praises of their small schools and urging the state to preserve DEI programming.

Photo by Shaun Robinson/VTDiggerAs lawmakers toil away trying to reform Vermont’s school funding and governance systems, they’ve declared better student outcomes a principal goal. Well, on Friday, the students themselves showed up to testify on H.454, as well as on efforts from the administration of President Donald Trump to cut diversity, equity and inclusion programs in public schools. And while the youth had lots of positives to say about their schools, they weren’t so effusive about where lawmakers are headed. “When I first read the governor’s proposal,” Zoe Epstein, a Champlain Valley Union High School junior said, “I was shocked by the absence of student input.”Lawmakers often hear the same voices again and again, but the students who showed up before the House and Senate education committees Friday represented Vermont in all its complexity. The committees received testimony from public and private school students. Rural students and students from the state’s largest district. Students who have experienced racism, homelessness and those for whom English is a second language. Almost all the students who spoke praised the individualized experiences small classes and schools provide. “Consolidation may ease the burden on taxpayers,” Willow Sharma, a Brattleboro Union High School student said, but “small schools mean so much for our Vermont communities.”Students at the Long Trail School, an independent school in Dorset, warned lawmakers of the diminished opportunities that restricting school choice would have on kids like themselves.Attending the private school would have been “entirely out of my family’s financial ability without school choice,” Morgan Cable, a Long Trail student, said.From southern Vermont to the Champlain Valley, high school students urged lawmakers to preserve or expand diversity, equity and inclusion programming, especially as the state grapples with confusing federal demands to end “illegal DEI.”“As a person of color growing up in Vermont, I spent a lot of time in spaces that weren’t made for people like me,” Arena Coryer, a Colchester High School student, said, but DEI gives her “hope” not just for herself but “every student who’s ever felt like they didn’t belong.”Though most students focused on the laudable outcomes they see in their small schools, Max Demaine, a student at Lake Region Union High School, addressed the economic aspects of lawmakers’ and Gov. Phil Scott’s policy proposals. He pointed out that his Northeast Kingdom district, which serves a high proportion of economically disadvantaged students, spends far less than many schools in the state. Yet lawmakers were considering consolidating rural schools like his and allowing wealthy districts to keep spending more per student. “Why not make other schools have the same model as us?” he asked. — Ethan WeinsteinIn the knowPresident Donald Trump’s administration on Thursday told states and other recipients of federal transportation funding that they could lose those dollars if they do not comply with the White House’s interpretation of federal laws — including on immigration.The guidance, outlined in a letter from U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, told recipients that their obligations, by taking federal funding, included “cooperating with and not impeding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” as well as other agencies, “in the enforcement of Federal immigration law.”Duffy said, without providing specifics, that there had been instances in which recipients of federal funding did not cooperate with “ICE investigations,” and that some recipients had “issued driver’s licenses to individuals present in the United States in violation of Federal immigration law,” which he suggested would be grounds for losing federal dollars. Since 2014, Vermont has allowed people who live in the state — but who do not have lawful status or U.S. citizenship — to get “driver’s privilege” cards. It’s one of 19 states, along with Washington, D.C., that offer “driving privileges to unauthorized immigrants,” according to data compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures.Read more about the letter and responses later at VTDigger.org.— Shaun RobinsonOn the moveThe Legislature has approved S.28, which makes technical changes that strengthen protections enacted last year for people who practice “legally protected health care activity” in Vermont, including reproductive health services and gender-affirming care. The Senate also approved S.131, an amendment to the charter of the City of Burlington that would ban the carrying of guns into bars and other places that serve alcoholic beverages.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers continue to debate the first increase to the gas tax in 20 years, with the House on Friday narrowly advancing a 5-cent tax increase while the Senate unanimously defeated a separate bill with a 3-cent increase.
Supporters in the House said the increase is needed to adequately maintain roads and bridges. A 5-cent increase to the motor fuels tax, which includes gasoline and diesel, would put North Dakota at 28 cents, still competitive with neighboring states.
Members of the Senate, meanwhile, objected to raising the gas tax while at the same time trying to cut property taxes, which has been a primary goal of the legislative session.
Lawmakers debate 3-cent gas tax increase, hike in EV registration fee

“It doesn’t make sense to the Senate to offer and promise property tax relief, and then we tax you on the backside of something else that everybody uses,” said Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg.
The 5-cent gas tax proposal is contained in the North Dakota Department of Transportation budget, Senate Bill 2012. House members voted 61-31 to advance the budget, but the gas tax amendment to the bill only passed by a 47-42 margin. 
North Dakota has not increased the motor fuels tax since 2005. Rep. Jon Nelson, R-Rugby, said vehicles have become more efficient in that time, leading to a leveling off or decline in overall gas tax revenue to support road projects.
“This is a fairness tax or a fairness levy,” Nelson said. “The people who are using the roads are the ones paying for it.”
Rep. Don Vigesaa, R-Cooperstown, said the gas tax revenue is not keeping pace with the inflation the Department of Transportation is seeing with construction costs. The tax increase is estimated to raise an additional $70 million.
Supporters also said the dollars are needed to get federal matching funds for road projects.
“This is about safety, this is about fixing our roads, even our rest areas,” said Rep. David Monson, R-Osnabrock. “We have so many needs in North Dakota.”
Others in the House urged a no vote on the tax increase, arguing that it would lead to the state spending more taxpayer money. 
“This is a tax on our family, our friends and our constituents,” said Rep. Dan Johnston, R-Kathryn. “And the state is flush with money.”
Across the hall, the Senate voted 45-0 against House Bill 1382, which would raise the motor fuels tax to 26 cents per gallon and increase registration fees for electric vehicles. It’s estimated to raise an additional $42 million for counties, cities and townships to use on road projects.
“This bill would place a heavy burden on North Dakota residents since 80% of all the fuel purchased in the state is by our residents,” said Sen. Michelle Powers, R-Fargo. “We would be asking for approximately $50 to $100 per year from our constituents, mainly affecting our rural communities.”
She also said supporters of the gas tax increase have lamented that the gas tax has not been increased in more than 20 years.
“Just because a tax hasn’t been raised doesn’t mean it should be raised,” she said.
The gas tax in Minnesota is 32 cents per gallon, 28 cents in South Dakota and 33 cents in Montana.
The Department of Transportation budget is going to a conference committee, which meets Saturday. The House also added to the bill $155 million in bonding to finance the four-laning of 19 miles of U.S. Highway 85, including a sensitive 6-mile stretch through the Badlands south of Watford City.

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)When House Bill 145, aimed at raising nonresident base hunting license fees from $15 to $100, moved through committee hearings, the legislation saw opposition from the Montana Outfitters and Guides Association who thought the increase “drastic.”  
Gov. Greg Gianforte agreed, and on Tuesday sent the bill back to the legislature with a recommended amendment for a more moderate increase — to just $50. 
“Like the Montana Outfitters and Guides Association and other conservation groups, I support a modest increase of the nonresident base hunting license fee, but believe the increase from $15 to $100 is too great,” Gianforte wrote in his amendatory veto letter. 
The shift from $100 down to $50 still represents a 230% increase from the existing license fee. Forty dollars of each fee goes to fund access programs for hunters, including the Block Management Program, and will generate an additional $2.5 million, according to projections from the governor’s budget office. 
The House and Senate on Thursday both approved of the governor’s amendment. 
“This has been a really entertaining bill,” Rep. Gary Parry, R-Colstrip, said on the House floor. “It started out at 100, you go to committee, they drop it to 50, then it comes back from the Senate up to 100. I’m going ‘Yeah, no,’ I don’t even know in committee which one I’m supposed to defend. 
“Anyway, so the governor got it and he said ‘No, gonna be 50,’ and here we are complaining we got so much money in the budget, I’m trying to give him more money and he’s taking it away. So, let’s concur.”  
Parry said he was concerned that if the House rejected the amendment, the governor would exercise one of the executive branch’s check on legislative power and issue an outright veto. 
Montana’s governor has three versions of veto power over legislation that reaches his desk. 
The most basic is the outright veto, when the governor decides, for any reason, that he does not agree with a bill passed by the Legislature. A two-thirds vote by both chambers — conducted as normal business if in session, by a mail poll after adjournment, or during a special session — can override a veto. 
Gianforte also holds the power to issue individual line item vetoes in bills that appropriate state funds, while approving the bulk of the bill — a power shared by 44 state governors. 
Line item vetos don’t often receive much attention, as they often involve ensuring a budget is balanced, but a case in Wisconsin drew national attention in 2023 when Democratic Gov. Tony Evers removed a few words in a 158-page budget bill to increase school funding for 400 years, instead of the intended two. 
Montana’s governor can also recommend amendments to bills, officially called an “amendatory veto.” Similar to amendments made in a legislative committee, altered bills must be approved by both chambers and then returned to the governor for final consideration.
If one or both chambers reject the amendments, the bill returns to the governor in its original form, where he could then opt to veto it outright. If only one chamber approves of the recommendations, a conference committee may be convened to hammer out the differences. 
On Thursday, the House and Senate approved of the governor’s amendments to several bills in addition to House Bill 145. 
Changes to Senate Bill 45, which creates a judicial performance evaluation system for sitting judges, removed a section which would have added the evaluation information to the state’s voter information pamphlet. 
Amendments to a bill revising the Montana Heritage Preservation and Development Commission kept the legislature from reducing the number of members, while Gianforte amended a bill about reporting on the costs of fiscal legislation to be an annual, rather than bi-annual report. 
According to a spokesperson for the governor’s office, Gianforte has recommended amendments to seven bills this session.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250212_MTLeg-292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-25 19:07:44.210515

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)After the arrest of Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan by federal agents Friday morning, the city’s political and activist communities responded forcefully, protesting against the arrest across the city. 
Dugan was charged with obstruction of justice and harboring an individual after a group of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agents showed up outside of her courtroom last week to arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. 
The criminal complaint against Durgan alleges she broke the law by allowing Flores-Ruiz to use a side door in her courtroom to exit without going past the agents. The agents saw him leave and later apprehended him on foot. 
While a larger protest took place outside of the federal courthouse in downtown Milwaukee, local resident Jeneca Wolski stood alone outside of the county courthouse where Dugan was arrested.
“[I’m] just a local citizen who is horrified that we are finding ourselves in this position right now,” Wolski told the Wisconsin Examiner. “We’re sliding downhill so fast. I don’t want to be looked back on by history as part of it. We have to do everything we can to kick and fight and scream to save our democracy right now.” 
At a press conference, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley accused the administration of President Donald Trump of acting to intimidate “anyone who opposes these policies.” Crowley added that Dugan was arrested by a “large, performative showing” of federal agents in the county courthouse. 
 “We have an obligation to administer our courts in a safe, efficient manner that delivers due process for anyone,” Crowley said. “The Trump administration’s actions are clearly preventing us from doing so by intimidating judges and eroding public faith in our judicial system.” 
People gathered outside the federal courthouse in Milwaukee Friday afternoon to protest Dugan’s arrest. At the rally, Christine Neumann Ortiz, executive director of immigrant rights group Voces De La Frontera, told the Wisconsin Examiner the Trump administration was trying to undermine efforts to oppose its immigration policies.
“They basically want to be unleashed to do whatever they want to commit these raids in courtrooms across the country,” she said. “They don’t want any resistance from judges or from the community standing up for people’s due process rights or limiting their policies of mass deportation and racism.”
Seven of the city of Milwaukee’s legislative representatives said in a joint statement that Dugan’s arrest and ICE operating inside the courthouse will “lead to a breakdown of civil society.”
“The County Courthouse is a sanctuary for justice and peace where the accused come forward willingly in a fair and unbiased process,” said the lawmakers, Sens. Chris Larson and Tim Carpenter and Reps. Christine Sinicki, Darrin Madison, Supreme Moore Omokunde, Angelito Tenorio and Sequanna Taylor. “Arresting people out of a courtroom will lead to a breakdown of civil society. We do not support the presence of ICE in places where it will lead to intimidation against witnesses and victims of crimes, denying everyone involved the justice they deserve.”
U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, questioned how Dugan’s arrest makes the country safer. 
“The Trump Administration continues to test the limits of our Constitution — this time by arresting a sitting judge for allegedly obstructing an immigration operation at the courthouse,” Durbin said. “When immigration enforcement officials interfere with our criminal justice system, it undermines public safety, prevents victims and witnesses from coming forward, and often prevents those who committed crimes from facing justice in the United States. How does this make America any safer? How does arresting a sitting judge make America any safer? It is imperative that Judge Dugan is afforded due process and the presumption of innocence, as required by our Constitution and her fundamental rights as an American.”
State Senate Minority Leader Diane Hesselbein (D-Middleton) and Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety, criticized the arrest in a joint statement. 
“Today’s arrest of a sitting judge, at the Milwaukee County Courthouse, is a frightening escalation of the Trump Administration’s attacks on America’s judicial system,” they said. “This is part of a pattern by this Administration – defying court orders, flouting the democratic system of checks and balances, ignoring the right to due process, and threatening judicial independence – that alarms us as legislators and as residents of this great state and this great country. We will follow this case closely. We will continue to stand up to lawless and unconstitutional actions. And, we will always fight for a bedrock principle of American democracy: equal justice under the law.”
The Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, an activist group, was planning protests Friday afternoon outside the federal courthouse and Saturday outside the FBI’s Milwaukee field office. In a statement, the group said the arrest was a “heinous attack.” 
“They are seeking to send a clear message: either you play along with Trump’s agenda, or pay the consequences,” the group said. “During this period of racist and political repression, we must stand together to denounce today’s actions by the FBI. What happened to Dugan is not new. The FBI and other agencies have been emboldened in recent months, snatching people off the streets, separating families, terrorizing communities, breaking doors down of pro-Palestine activists, and contributing to the unjust deportation of immigrants who don’t have criminal records. What is new is that they have gone after a judge.”

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.



They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Photo courtesy of a participant who asked not to be identified) An unlicensed dog breeder from California who was caught on an audio recording has been fined $15,400 for offering puppies for sale Easter weekend at a Las Vegas class offering “Puppies & Yoga.” 
It’s illegal to sell dogs without a breeder’s license in Clark County, which is enduring a critical animal overpopulation crisis. A bill before state lawmakers would prohibit retail pet sales statewide.
“I don’t need a license,” the breeder, Denise Gottlieb, told the Current when reached by phone. “I do this all over the country.” 
An activity report obtained by the Current from Clark County Animal Control says Gottlieb of Pinon Springs, CA, had 11 puppies and three adult dogs at a Puppies & Yoga class Easter weekend at Kalma Events in Commercial Center.
“Fines for illegal selling of puppies range from a minimum of $500 per count or the sale price or offered sale price of the animal,” Clark County spokesperson Yazmin Beltran said via email.  “Fines have ranged from $500-$5,000 per count.”
In 2024, the county issued citations for 94 counts of illegal sales of puppies, with fines totaling $201,250. So far in 2025, the county has issued fines totaling $46,700 for 36 counts of illegal sales.  
Gottlieb, when confronted by Animal Control officers who were tipped off to the event on April 19 by Nevada Voters for Animals, denied she was selling the puppies and refused to provide her identification to officers, who she alleged cited her because she called them the “f-cken dog catcher,” according to the county’s activity report.  
Gottlieb “became very confrontational,” the report says, when officers told her they “received statements and audio as evidence” of the attempted sales. Gottlieb can be heard on the recording offering one puppy for $750 and another for $1,295. 
“I could have walked out of there with a puppy, with no adoption record, nothing,” says one of two animal rescuers who attended the class and recorded Gottlieb. The Current agreed not to identify the sources out of concern for retaliation.
The county’s report says a man identified as Edgar, the owner of the business, told Animal Control officers via phone that “he has the breeder’s (sic) sign a contract stating that the sale of animals is not permitted on the property or during class,” however, officers did not ask to see the contract, according to a County spokesperson. 
Gottlieb said she was unaware of such a contractual provision. 
The Current was unable to find a local business license for Puppies & Yoga, which operates in 14 states, according to its website. 
Puppies and Yoga did not respond to numerous requests for comment.  
Wellness trend or commoditization?
“I feel like they are using puppies for money,” said one of the two animal advocates who tipped off authorities to the attempted sales. 
Puppies and Yoga Las Vegas charges $69 per person and advertises as many as five classes a day on the weekend, each for about 20 people.
“Our puppies come from breeders who recognize the importance of early socialization and want their puppies to be well-socialized before moving to their new homes,” says Puppies & Yoga’s website.
Yoga classes featuring small animals such as puppies, kittens, goats, and rabbits are a popular trend.  Animal advocates are increasingly concerned, noting potential emotional and physical trauma can befall small animals, and citing health concerns, such as intestinal parasites that are common in puppies and can be transmitted to other dogs and to humans. 
Italy’s Ministry of Health has banned “puppy yoga” classes, the BBC reports, saying it was aware that organizers “borrow” puppies from breeders.
Gottlieb can be heard on the recording saying she brings the puppies to town every weekend. It’s unknown whether the puppies were used in subsequent yoga classes on Saturday. 
The company did not respond to requests for comment on whether it has considered using its events to assist shelters and rescues with adoptions. 
“We’ve done puppy yoga as a fundraiser twice,” said one of the Current’s sources, who operates an animal rescue. “But all of the money goes back to the rescue.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/more-cropped-puppy-art-1024x760.jpg,,,2025-04-25 19:07:44.210515

The state-owned power company will start charging a special rate to ensure energy-intensive data centers are paying their share of costs to build new power plants. (File photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette).South Carolina’s state-owned power company will start charging a special electricity rate executives say is meant to ensure energy-intensive data centers, built to serve the country’s ever-growing technology needs, are covering the cost of generating the massive amount of power they require.
The goal is to ensure existing customers don’t end up footing the bill for new, power-hungry companies.
The governing board of Santee Cooper voted unanimously Friday to implement the new rate for large, incoming customers on an “experimental” four-year basis, testing it out before considering whether they want to make the policy permanent.
In a presentation to the board, Mike Smith, director of billing and pricing for the Moncks Corner-based utility, said he anticipates large customers coming into Santee Cooper territory could need as much as 1,000 megawatts of power as soon as 2030.
“That’s significant growth for a system the size of ours,” he said.
That growth rate mirrors the demand utilities are seeing across the Southeast, he said.
“We expect that to continue,” Smith said. “We don’t think it’s going to abate anytime soon.”
The new rate goes beyond data centers.
It applies to any customer requiring 50 megawatts of power or more, which would sweep in some of the electric vehicle and battery manufacturers under construction in the state. Those companies have reported energy needs between 100 and 150 megawatts, according to economic development officials.
Still, it’s data centers that have dominated the conversation around energy in South Carolina. These windowless buildings house rows of servers necessary for everything from artificial intelligence to high-speed financial trades. The largest of these centers can use as much as 200 megawatts each.
“We do welcome large loads because they’re good loads for the system. However, because of their size and operating characteristics, they’re difficult for Santee Cooper to absorb,” Smith said.
Santee Cooper’s new experimental rate comes as South Carolina grapples with how to meet the energy needs of a growing population, manufacturing base and, of course, an influx of data centers being built by tech giants such as Google, Meta and Blox.
A provision on the issue was inserted in legislation under consideration by the General Assembly.
Senate passes sweeping energy bill aimed at meeting SC’s growing power needs

In a late-night debate about two weeks ago, the Senate voted to limit tax and power-related incentives the state allows for data centers. Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey pushed for the change saying that as data centers come to South Carolina, he wants them to pay an equivalent share of the costs for power plants built to serve them.
In the weeks since the Senate vote, which amended a bill previously passed by the House with almost no opposition, data center developers have pushed back, said Geoff Penland, Santee Cooper’s director of government relations.
He said technology companies are worried about the loss of sales tax breaks they’ve historically received on both computer equipment and electricity.
Penland said it appears the House and Senate may reach a compromise on the matter with just two weeks left in the legislative session.
While Santee Cooper is largely unconcerned with incentives for data centers, the energy legislation is of the utmost importance to the utility as it seeks permission to partner with private utility company Dominion Energy on a possible 2,000-megawatt natural gas plant on the site of a former coal-fired power plant along the Edisto River in Colleton County.
And the board’s vote Friday means these new power rates will go into effect no matter what legislators ultimately decide on data centers.
Meeting a growing energy demand requires construction of expensive power plants, power transmission lines, as well as the purchase of extra power that Santee Cooper has to buy from other utility companies on occasion when it doesn’t have enough energy of its own.
Building and buying those things mean increased rates for all customers, even if those other customers aren’t the ones driving the need for those investments, Smith said. That’s what Santee Cooper is trying to curtail.
Smith pointed to a similar effort by Georgia Power Company, which asked utility regulators to develop special contractual terms for large users.
Under Santee Cooper’s new rate, large users must sign a 15-year contract, one they can’t get out of without paying a set minimum. The utility also will charge more for power used at times of day when demand for energy is at its highest.
Santee Cooper worries about the possibility that these large users, particularly data centers, could come on the grid and then leave before the utility is able to get back the money it spent to serve them, Smith said. The long-term contract aims to prevent that.
Finally, the new deals require large users to ramp up to their full contracted power usage within three years.
“It also protects us from somebody who comes in, oversells, and says they’re going to come in at 300 megawatts and ends up at 127 (megawatts),” Smith gave as an example.
“Regardless of how many kilowatt hours this customer uses, if they come on the system, they’ll be accountable,” he added.
While the board ultimately all voted in favor of the change, two members who represent South Carolina’s power cooperatives, which get their power from Santee Cooper, raised concerns that no large customer would agree to these new terms.
They said Santee Cooper and rural electric cooperatives will lose potential new business.
They also worried about the speed with which the change was made. Santee Cooper staff will typically take 18 months to vet and implement a new, permanent rate. This change was studied over just a few months.
In an effort to allay concerns, staff told the board because of the rate’s “experimental” status, it could make changes at any point in the four-year trial period.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DSC_0320-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-25 18:06:01.975425

Kim Reynolds testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Feb. 5, 2025 about government efficiency efforts in Iowa. (Photo courtesy of CSPAN)Gov. Kim Reynolds has filed a lawsuit against the Des Moines Register that seeks to keep confidential some of the written communications among her senior advisors.
In court papers filed Friday by Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, Reynolds asks for an injunction to stop the Register “from demanding production of the documents protected by executive privilege.”
The lawsuit, filed in Polk County District Court, argues that the Register “contends that the governor may not communicate with, or privately correspond with, her most senior advisors without those communications being open public records. That is not — and cannot be — the law.” The lawsuit claims that such a requirement for disclosure would preclude her from receiving “candid advice from her closest advisors.”
However, the Register argues that the documents being withheld by Reynolds were not authored by, or sent to, Reynolds, and are instead part of an exchange among her advisors and staff.
The documents in question are tied to Reynold’s Feb. 5 testimony before the U.S. House Oversight Committee, which was conducting hearings on government efficiency. At the time, Reynolds was questioned by U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, as to whether she agreed with Michael Flynn, a former advisor to President Donald Trump, that Lutheran Family Services was connected to a “money-laundering operation.”
During the hearing, Reynolds answered by saying, “I can tell you that in Iowa, the taxpayers of Iowa hold me personally responsible and accountable for state government, just as they hold President Trump accountable,” and when pressed on whether she agreed with Flynn, she said “I can’t speak to that.”
Days later, Reynolds said she “absolutely” did not agree with Flynn’s assessment and praised the organization for its charitable works.
The Register then sought access to emails to and from several of Reynolds’ advisers that referenced Lutheran Family Services. Reynolds’ office says it turned over more than 800 pages of documents, while withholding four documents that it said contained “candid, private advice and counsel from her most senior advisors.”
According to the Register, the four withheld emails are each labeled with the subject line “Media Prep Doc,” and Reynolds herself was not copied on those emails.
In the newly filed lawsuit, Reynolds’ office argues the Register’s view is that “executive privilege cannot include documents sent between senior staff intended for the governor. Instead, presumably, the governor must be CC’d or otherwise included on an email or other communication directly to assert privilege.”
Mason Mauro, Reynolds’ spokesperson, said Friday in a written statement that “it is in the public’s interest that governors can receive candid advice from their closest advisors. We are confident that the judicial branch will recognize that governors have a constitutional executive privilege in Iowa, just as they recognized a legislative privilege last year, and have used a deliberative privilege to protect the communications of Iowa Supreme Court justices.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Reynolds.CSPAN_.2.5-e1738792607674-1024x638.png,,,2025-04-25 18:06:01.975425

Naig was a guest Friday on the Iowa PBS show “Iowa Press,” where he also discussed the challenges facing Iowa’s agricultural economy, bird flu and eminent domain.
Naig, a Republican and native Iowan, has been ag secretary since 2018 and was reelected in 2022.
No official bid for governor
Naig said the announcement from Gov. Kim Reynolds that she would not be seeking reelection came as “a bit of a surprise” that has caused him to pause and consider the possibility of running for the position. 
“I still, at this stage of my life, I want to be of service to the state of Iowa, and I want to think about the best ways that I can do that,” Naig said. 
Naig said at this time the discussion is on his “side of the table” with family, friends and supporters to decide if a run for governor is the best path forward.

When pressed for more details, like staff and campaign strategies in the event of gubernatorial bid, Naig said he’s not to that point. 
“This is around my kitchen table, this is about me getting into a planter tractor here in the next couple weeks and giving a lot of thought to it,” Naig said. “That’s not to say we’re not talking to a lot of folks.” 
Naig said Republicans in Iowa have a deep bench of potential candidates. Attorney General Brenna Bird, Sen. Mike Bousselot, House Speaker Pat Grassley, and Rep. Bobby Kaufmann have said they are considering the gig. 
Changes impacting ag in Iowa 
Naig said the agricultural economy in Iowa is “tough” and while there were positive trade outcomes from the first Trump administration’s foreign policy, Iowa farmers are in a worse position now to weather potential trade wars. 
“We don’t have the kind of buffer in our ag economy — profitability and margins are not where they were even then, today,” Naig said. “There’s not a lot of room to absorb that shock.” 
Naig said this was a message sent to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins during her recent visit to Iowa, and that the ag department should be ready to support farmers. 
Naig said he is “encouraged” by the countries that are coming to the table to negotiate better trade deals, and hopes to see greater domestic consumption of ag commodities by expanding the ethanol industry and branching into sustainable aviation fuel. 
“What you hope and certainly what we’re advocating for is unleashing that domestic consumption, but needing to make sure that we’ve got an expanded trade portfolio as well,” Naig said. 
Naig said India could be a potential “game changer” if the country were able to make a trade agreement with the country. 
Bird flu 
The nation is in its fourth year of an outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has impacted more than 168 million birds nationally. 
Naig said he is considering options, like a vaccine for birds, now that he was not willing to consider three years ago. He also said there needs to be more people in the animal industries sector of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to respond to outbreaks like HPAI.
The Iowa secretary said he did not believe a “herd immunity” approach, which has been suggested by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was “a workable solution” to the bird flu.
Other issues 
Naig has been pushing for the Legislature to expand the Choose Iowa program, which helps to market and support Iowa grown products and producers. 
One of its programs is similar to the recently cut federal Local Food for School and Local Food Purchase Assistance programs, which were COVID-era funds to help schools and local institutions purchase from local farmers. 
Naig said he hopes the Choose Iowa versions, which this year were just pilot programs, could be a permanent program, funded through regular appropriations rather than short-term funding pools. 
“We want something that can actually stand the test of time, be around, be something that you can plan for,” Naig said. 
Naig also addressed the issue of eminent domain, which has been a growing topic of debate across the state, particularly in relation to a carbon sequestration pipeline that has planned more than 1,000 miles of pipeline in the state. 
“It should be rare,” Naig said. “It should be the least desirable option to get something done, and there should be overwhelming voluntary agreements in place before something like a project — any project with eminent domain — would go forward.”

Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.
A Louisiana judge this week set aside the first-degree murder conviction and death sentence of Jimmie Chris Duncan, whose 1998 conviction for killing his girlfriend’s 23-month-old daughter was based in part on bite mark evidence that experts now say is junk science.
The decision comes after a Verite News and ProPublica investigation in March examined the questions surrounding Duncan’s conviction as Gov. Jeff Landry, a staunch death penalty advocate, made moves to expedite executions after a 15-year pause.
Judge Alvin Sharp, of the 4th Judicial District in Ouachita Parish, pointed to new testimony during a September appeals hearing that such bite mark analysis presented by a once-heralded forensics team is “no longer valid” and “not scientifically defensible.”
The original analysis came from forensic dentist Michael West and pathologist Dr. Steven Hayne, whose longtime partnership as state experts fell under legal scrutiny after questions emerged about the validity of their techniques.

Over the past 27 years, nine prisoners have been set free after being convicted in part on inaccurate evidence given by West and Hayne. Three of those men were on death row.
Duncan was the last person awaiting an execution based on the pair’s work, which Sharp said in his ruling appeared “questionable at best.”
Other expert witnesses said that Hayne’s autopsy and his findings were “sloppy in practice” and “inadequate overall.”
“It is worth noting that the qualifications of Dr. Hayne were lacking in certain ways to an extent that called into serious question” the pathologist’s “expert designation,” Sharp wrote in his ruling.
Sharp also stated in his ruling that he found “very compelling” the September testimony of an expert medical witness who said that the child’s death was not the result of a homicide but of an accidental drowning.
It remains unclear when — or if — Duncan will walk free.
Robert S. Tew, district attorney for the 4th Judicial District, can choose to appeal the decision, retry Duncan on the murder charge or a lesser offense or accept the court’s ruling and set him free. Tew did not respond to requests for comment. Duncan’s legal team declined to comment.
Louisiana has a long record of convicting and sentencing to death people later found to be innocent. In the past three decades, the state has exonerated 11 people facing execution, among the highest such numbers in the country, according to The National Registry of Exonerations.
Duncan, 56, has maintained his innocence for more than three decades, while prosecutors continued to insist that Duncan committed the murder and should be executed without delay.
Duncan was babysitting Haley Oliveaux, his girlfriend’s daughter, at the house they shared in West Monroe, on Dec. 18, 1993. He said he had left her alone in the bathtub while he washed dishes. At some point, he said he heard a loud noise from the bathroom. When he went to check on Haley, he found her floating face down in the water. She was pronounced dead a few hours later.
While Duncan claimed it was a tragic accident, authorities charged him with first-degree murder after Hayne and West examined the girl’s body and determined there was evidence she was sexually assaulted and intentionally drowned. After about two weeks of testimony in 1998, the jury found Duncan guilty and sentenced him to death.
Years later, Duncan’s post-conviction attorneys uncovered evidence that was not presented at trial that, they said, proves his innocence. This includes a jailhouse informant who wrote to prosecutors offering to share Duncan’s confession to the crime in what the defense claims was an exchange for leniency (the informant later recanted his trial testimony); past head injuries Haley suffered that might explain her death; and a video in which West can be seen grinding a cast of Duncan’s teeth into Haley’s body. West later claimed those bite marks, which the defense says the forensic dentist manufactured, were a match for Duncan’s teeth.
Hayne died in 2020. West did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the ruling.
West has previously said he was simply using what he called a “direct comparison” technique, in which he presses a mold of a person’s teeth directly onto the location of suspected bite marks because it provides the most accurate results, according to a 2020 interview with Oxygen.com.
West said he no longer believed in bite mark analysis in a 2011 deposition in a different post-conviction appeal, saying, “I don’t believe it’s a system that’s reliable enough to be used in court” and admitted to making mistakes in previous cases. But he told The New Republic in a 2023 interview that his methods are valid because other people have used them.
In this week’s ruling, Sharp also noted the September testimony of Detective Chris Sasser, who investigated Haley’s death. Sasser said there was “no blood, no signs of struggle, no cleaning rags and no cleaning agents” in the bathroom or house where the alleged crime occurred. This undermined the state’s assertion that there was “massive blood loss,” the ruling said.
In addition, Sharp found that Duncan’s trial attorney, Louis Scott, provided ineffective counsel. Sharp pointed to a witness who testified that Scott failed to “investigate or present evidence that was available at the time of the trial,” that he did not “develop a coherent theory of defense,” and that he failed to disclose a conflict of interest.
Scott’s wife told Verite News and ProPublica that he has suffered significant health problems including memory and speech impairment and declined to comment on the judge’s ruling.
Duncan is among 55 people on death row in Louisiana, though until very recently he and the others were not in imminent danger of being executed as the state hadn’t put anyone to death since 2010 due to the unavailability of execution drugs. That changed with Landry’s 2023 election.
Landry has made clear his intention to carry out these death sentences as soon as possible, having recently approved the use of nitrogen gas, a controversial method allowed in only three other states.
This cleared the way for the state’s first execution in more than 15 years, as Jessie Hoffman was put to death on March 18 using nitrogen gas.

US revokes a lawful international student’s visa at Middlebury College

The news last month of SEVIS statuses being revoked came with orders to self-deport, sending many international students scrambling. Soon after, in a Michigan court, the Department of Homeland Security stated that changes to SEVIS have no bearing on a student’s lawful status, sowing further confusion.A University of Vermont spokesperson confirmed Friday that its students have not faced any visa revocations officials are aware of. Officials from St. Michael’s College also said they were not affected by the revocation.“Out of respect for the safety and privacy of those community members, we will not be publicly sharing specific information related to our community members’ immigration or visa status,” Gretchen Galbraith, vice president of academic affairs and provost at St. Michael’s, said in an emailed statement.Across Vermont, several colleges and universities declined to comment, some in an effort to safeguard student security.The American Civil Liberties Union that brought some of the lawsuits challenging the student visa revocation celebrated the change Friday.“The power of the people is stronger than the people in power,” said Hillary Rich, senior staff attorney with the Vermont ACLU, in a statement. “ACLU affiliates brought over a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration’s unlawful termination of student visas across the country — and now the administration has reversed course.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Trump administration reverses course on international student visa crackdown .",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Middlebury-College-Campus-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-25 18:06:01.975425

Joel Rudman and Tracy Caruso in the Capitol on April 25, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)For the past month, something of a civil war has raged between Florida Republicans in Tallahassee.
Gov. Ron DeSantis has accused Florida GOP House leadership of being “at war with the voters who provided the supermajority in the first place.”
He’s criticized them for ignoring his request for a property tax cut and not doing enough on condominium legislation.
And he’s accused them of working with the “liberal media” in the now-concluded investigation into Hope Florida, the welfare assistance program led by First Lady Casey DeSantis.
As a show of support, supporters of DeSantis called for a “Rally in Tally” Friday afternoon at the Capitol in support of his “Freedom Agenda.”
There was no such rally, but there was a press conference on the Plaza Level of the Capitol featuring former Panhandle House Republican Dr. Joel Rudman and Tracy Caruso, wife of Palm Beach County GOP Rep. Mike Caruso, along with some DeSantis supporters.
‘There was a mandate when we voted DeSantis in … and there isn’t a person here who ran on the idea of dismantling any of DeSantis’ policies,” said Tracy Caruso, who has already filed to run in the House District 87 seat in 2026 now held by her husband.
“My message to everyone here is please come out and talk to your representatives,” she added. “Tell them that you stand with our great Gov. Ron DeSantis.”
Text messages sent this week to voters from Restore Our Nation (RON) PAC, a DeSantis-affiliated political committee, bore a similar message: “Florida House leaders are working with Democrats to stop our agenda and sabotage Florida’s success. … Call your State Rep … and tell them to stand with the people and me to keep Florida free!”
  Text messages like this were sent to Floridians this week from Restore Our Nation (RON) PAC.
Rudman stepped down from his seat representing parts of Okaloosa and Santa Rosa counties late last year to run for the congressional seat vacated by Matt Gaetz, but lost in the GOP primary to former CFO Jimmy Patronis.
He said on Friday that he was “appalled at what was being taught” at a learning session for House members last November.
“We weren’t being taught open carry. We weren’t being taught red flag laws. We weren’t being taught immigration,” he said. “Instead, the topics of discussion that afternoon from the top down were, ‘We are not listening to Ron DeSantis anymore.'”
Rudman has made these charges repeatedly in recent weeks, including during a press conference hosted by DeSantis last week.
“Looking back, once the session started, I had no idea what we were facing even here today,” Rudman said. 
“I had no idea that we would see what I would call treachery. Basically, we have the most popular conservative governor in America. Other people in other states stop me and they tell me, ‘I wish I was from Florida. What can we do to get your conservative leadership in Georgia? In South Carolina? In Mississippi? So, to have this open revolt was even more that I couldn’t dare imagine.”
“We cannot have representatives who go against our governor when he’s the one who makes the decision on these things,” added Larry Downs from Pensacola. “I don’t want the fighting amongst our governor and our legislators. I don’t like that. I want them to lead.”
 Perez responds
Perez fired back in a statement sent to Fox News on Friday.
“While the Florida House remains the most conservative body in the Legislature — passing a budget billions lower than the Governor’s, approving larger tax cuts than the Governor, and pushing bold conservative policies like repealing gun laws and passing E-Verify — the Governor seems uninterested in a conservative Legislature,” he said.
“He wants a compliant one. After seven years in office, it’s clear he doesn’t want people asking hard questions, especially after neglecting his duties while running for president.”
Rep. Caruso was also slated to speak at the event, but with the House in session, he was unable to attend.

Free.,"Arrest of Wisconsin judge ‘escalation’ in Trump-judiciary conflict, Democrats warn","Ashley Murray, Jacob Fischler",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/arrest-wisconsin-judge-escalation-trump-judiciary-conflict-democrats-warn,,"WASHINGTON — A handful of Democratic U.S. senators sounded the alarm Friday after federal agents arrested a Wisconsin judge on charges she obstructed immigration officials from detaining a man in her courtroom, saying the arrest marked a new low in President Donald Trump’s treatment of the law.Some congressional Democrats framed the FBI’s Friday morning arrest of Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan as a grave threat to the U.S. system of government, saying it was part of Trump’s effort to expand his own power and undermine the judiciary, with which the administration has become increasingly noncompliant.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer decried the judge’s arrest on social media late Friday afternoon as a “dangerous escalation.”“There are no kings in America. Trump and (Attorney General Pam) Bondi can't just decide to arrest sitting judges at will and threaten judges into submission,” wrote Schumer, a New York Democrat.Trump administration officials, including Bondi, defended the arrest as legitimate. The FBI had been investigating Dugan after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers sought to detain an immigrant without legal authority to be in the country who was in her courtroom on a misdemeanor charge.Bondi wrote on social media just after noon Eastern, “I can confirm that our @FBI agents just arrested Hannah Dugan — a county judge in Milwaukee — for allegedly helping an illegal alien avoid an arrest by @ICEgov. No one is above the law.”Democrats objectDemocrats in Washington who sounded their objections to the arrest Friday argued it subverted separation of powers.Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, said Trump “continues to test the limits of our Constitution — this time by arresting a sitting judge for allegedly obstructing an immigration operation at the courthouse.”In a statement, Durbin added that local courtrooms should be off limits to immigration enforcement agents.“When immigration enforcement officials interfere with our criminal justice system, it undermines public safety, prevents victims and witnesses from coming forward, and often prevents those who committed crimes from facing justice in the United States,” Durbin wrote.Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who represents Wisconsin, issued a statement shortly after news of the arrest, calling it “a gravely serious and drastic move.”“In the United States we have a system of checks and balances and separation of powers for damn good reasons,” Baldwin said.“The Trump Administration just arrested a sitting judge,” Arizona’s Ruben Gallego said in a social media post. “This is what happens in authoritarian countries. Stand up now — or lose the power to do so later. The administration must drop all charges and respect separation of powers.”Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who also sits on the Judiciary Committee, was more careful in his criticism but said Trump is “constantly challenging” separation of powers laid out in the Constitution.“I don’t know what happened in Wisconsin, but amplifying this arrest as the Attorney General and FBI Director have done looks like part of a larger intimidation campaign against judges,” the Rhode Island Democrat said in a statement.In a since-deleted post on Bluesky, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey accused Trump of “using immigrants to justify an all-out assault on our democracy and rule of law.“After openly defying a Supreme Court order, calling for judges to be impeached, and bullying and belittling judges, today his FBI director took the extreme step of ordering a sitting judge arrested,” Booker wrote, referring to the high court’s order that the Trump administration “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who is being held in El Salvador.Spokespeople for Booker did not respond to a late Friday inquiry about why the post was taken down.Trump officials back up arrestAdministration officials boasted online following the arrest.FBI Director Kash Patel deleted a post on X in which he wrote Dugan  “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery.Trump posted a screenshot on his social media site from the conservative activist account “Libs of TikTok” that featured a photo of Dugan and celebrated her arrest.White House Border Czar Tom Homan said that Dugan crossed a line in her opposition to the administration’s agenda.“People can choose to support illegal immigration and not assist ICE in removing criminal illegal aliens from our communities, BUT DON’T CROSS THAT LINE,” he wrote on X. “If you actively impede our enforcement efforts or if you knowingly harbor or conceal illegal aliens from ICE you will be prosecuted. These actions are felonies. More to come…”Trump vs. courtsTrump and administration officials have publicly attacked judges online, including calling for the impeachment of District Judge James Boasberg for the District of Columbia after he ordered immigration officials to halt deportation flights to El Salvador.The administration allowed the flights to reach Central America, and is now at risk of being held in criminal contempt of court as a legal fight plays out.The president’s verbal attacks on Boasberg prompted a rare rebuke from U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts in mid-March.And the administration has seemingly refused to do anything to facilitate the return of Maryland resident Abrego Garcia from a notorious El Salvador mega-prison, despite a Supreme Court order.",,,,2025-04-25 18:06:01.975425
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-25 21:28:37+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT, 18 states sue Trump administration over K-12 DEI guidance and threats to funding",Associated Press and CT Mirror Staff,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/25/ct-trump-administration-k-12-dei-lawsuit/,Attorney General William Tong joined a coalition of state AGs challenging the Education Department's interpretation of civil rights laws.,"Nineteen states that refused to comply with a Trump administration directive aimed at eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs in public schools went a step further Friday, filing a federal lawsuit challenging what they consider an illegal threat to cut federal funding. 
The lawsuit filed in Massachusetts by Democratic attorneys general seeks to block the Department of Education from withholding money based on its April 3 directive ordering states to certify their compliance with civil rights laws, including the rejection of what the federal government calls “illegal DEI practices.” States also were told to gather signatures from local school systems certifying their compliance by April 24. 
Instead, the plaintiffs — including Connecticut — informed the government that they stand by their prior certifications of compliance with the law but refuse to abandon policies that promote equal access to education. 
“There is just no question that Connecticut schools have and will continue to comply with federal civil rights laws,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement Friday. “From the start, this has been about [President Donald] Trump and Linda McMahon trying to force their MAGA ideology on Connecticut students and teachers by unlawfully withholding our taxpayer dollars. 
“This is illegal and deeply destructive, and we’re not going to let Trump and McMahon rob from our schools and imperil our children’s futures,” Tong said.
The new lawsuit comes a day after judges in three states ruled against the Trump administration in separate but related cases. 
A Maryland judge postponed the effective date of a Feb. 14 memo in which the education department told schools and colleges they needed to end any practice that differentiates people based on their race. A judge in Washington, D.C., granted a preliminary injunction against the April certification letter. And in New Hampshire, a judge ruled that the department can not enforce either document against the plaintiffs in that case, which includes one of the nation’s largest teachers’ unions. 
All three lawsuits argue that the guidance limits academic freedom and is so vague that it leaves schools and educators in limbo about what they may do, such as whether voluntary student groups for minority students are still allowed. 
The new lawsuit accuses the administration of imperiling more than $13.8 billion, including money used to serve students with disabilities. 
“Plaintiffs are left with an impossible choice: either certify compliance with an ambiguous and unconstitutional federal directive — threatening to chill polices, programs and speech – or risk losing indispensable funds that serve their most vulnerable student populations,” the lawsuit states. 
In addition to Campbell, the plaintiffs are the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. 
The education department did not respond to a request for comment Friday. President Donald Trump’s education secretary, Linda McMahon, has warned of potential funding cuts if states do not return the certification forms. 
In a Tuesday interview on the Fox Business Network, McMahon said that states that refuse to sign could “risk some defunding in their districts.” The purpose of the form is “to make sure there’s no discrimination that’s happening in any of the schools,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TongTruck-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-25 18:06:01.975425

Swanson has been on paid administrative leave since October 2024. Photo by Jennifer Hauck/Valley NewsThis story by John Lippman was first published in the Valley News on April 25.WOODSTOCK — Police Chief Joe Swanson has be demoted to patrol officer after a ruling by the Woodstock Village Trustees. The five trustees issued a decision this week that sided with Municipal Manager Eric Duffy, who proposed the demotion last fall, according to Swanson’s attorney, Linda Fraas, of Manchester, N.H.On Thursday morning, Swanson reported to work at the department as a patrol officer, the same entry-level position he held nearly 20 years ago, Fraas said.“There’s no obligation for him to return to work as a patrol officer, but he’s the kind of guy that knows they are short of police officers and he’s not going to hold it against the public for what (the Trustees) have done to him. So he showed up,” she said.The decision by the trustees appears to set the stage for a protracted legal battle. Swanson’s fight to be reinstated as police chief — or to seek redress for damages over what he claims is a breach of his employment contract — would now move to the courthouse.“We’ll be filing a lawsuit in Windsor Superior Court next week,” Fraas said on Thursday, confirming news first reported in the Vermont Standard this week.The decision by the trustees came out of a marathon 14-hour public hearing last month where several police department employees aired grievances over Swanson’s leadership. Trustees have maintained they would not disclose their decision to the public, asserting that Swanson’s demotion was a “personnel matter.” (It was Swanson who insisted that last month’s hearing be open to the public, otherwise the trustees would have held it behind closed doors.)Swanson, 45, was promoted to chief by Duffy in 2023 after decades with the Woodstock department. He was placed on paid administrative leave last fall following a traffic incident during which his husband, who was driving, got into a verbal altercation with another driver.Swanson was absolved of any wrongdoing in the traffic incident by two separate investigations. But the inquiries brought to the surface simmering tensions within Woodstock’s police department. The department is currently being run by Sgt. Chris O’Keefe, who was the department’s No. 2 ranked employee under Swanson and is now interim chief.Neither trustees nor Duffy responded to a Valley News request for comment this week.Fraas said she is waiting to consult with Swanson before releasing the trustees’ 47-page decision to the public. Fraas said the ruling was “really hard to grasp because it’s filled with so many insults and attacks on (Swanson’s) character, so many characterizations that are gratuitous, mean-spirited and hateful.”Fraas contended that it is unlawful for the town to demote Swanson because there is nothing in his contract that allows it.“They’re making up some statutory authority that doesn’t exist,” she said.Any claim of “just cause is equally ludicrous based on the evidence” that was contained in an investigator’s report of Swanson’s leadership and the testimony of several department employees in a public hearing last month, she said. Fraas ticked off a list of causes of action that she said would be included in Swanson’s lawsuit against the town, including “breach of contract, wrongful termination, intentional infliction of emotional distress and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.”In addition to the lawsuit, Fraas said she expects to appeal the trustees’ decision to superior court for review, which is allowed under state municipal law. Fraas said it is possible that at some point she may seek to have Swanson’s lawsuit against the town moved to another venue. She cited potential conflicts could that arise from among the various parties, ranging from their prior business before the court, the close contact between town officials and local residents and the wide media coverage of Swanson’s situation.Swanson grew up in Woodstock and has previously served on the Selectboard. The town’s police, emergency and fire building is named after his father, the late Phil Swanson, who was the longtime town manager. The current morass began in October when Swanson was a passenger in a vehicle driven by his husband, Nicholas Seldon, a Woodstock attorney. Seldon got into a heated encounter with the driver of other vehicle.The other driver filed a “citizen’s complaint” against Seldon and Swanson, which led Duffy to place Swanson on administrative leave while Vermont State Police investigated the incident. The investigation absolved Swanson of any criminal wrongdoing. At the same time, a parallel investigation by the Vermont Criminal Justice Council cleared Swanson of any professional misconduct.During the investigations, Duffy — who had promoted Swanson to chief only 15 months earlier — began getting reports from police department personnel about Swanson’s job performance. The complaints centered on poor communication, irregular work hours, poor recordkeeping, a messy office, uncomfortable interactions with staff and a habit of showing up out of uniform.The complaints led Duffy to hire an outside investigator, who delivered a report of his findings detailing Swanson’s supposed shortcomings. Around the same time, the police union and dispatchers union — each of which has a handful of members — issued “no confidence” votes of Swanson and called upon Duffy to hire a new chief.Duffy, testifying at the Trustees’ hearing last month, said the subsequent knowledge led him to change his mind about Swanson’s management skills. Duffy believed nonetheless that Swanson was a capable patrol officer and concluded that bumping him down to the bottom rung on the ladder in the department was the appropriate response.In the “quasi-judicial” hearing where the five trustees sat as “jurors” in a trial-like setting run by a “hearing officer” who was hired by the village, Swanson finally took the stand after midnight, some 14 hours into the proceeding. Swanson acknowledged he sometimes showed up at the office not dressed in full uniform, typically when he had an appointment with a physical therapist due to a gunshot wound he received in the line of duty in 2022.He said he believed his relationship and interactions with officers and dispatchers “felt very good.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Woodstock demotes police chief to patrol officer.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/joe-swanson-woodstock.jpg?fit=749%2C500&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-25 18:06:01.975425

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)A Republican state lawmaker in Washington won’t be allowed back in the House chamber this session following his latest outburst during a legislative debate.
Rep. Jeremie Dufault, R-Selah, will be participating remotely in the last three days after his latest verbal disruption proved to be “the last straw” for House leaders.
“What I did was a breach of decorum. I accept the consequences of my action,” Dufault said in a statement Friday. “But I will also continue to fight for my constituents and stand up to the tyranny of the majority when needed.”
Dufault, who represents the 15th Legislative District in central Washington, has been rebuked several times in the course of the 105-day session for making comments in floor debates that run afoul of House decorum.
On Thursday, at the outset of debate on a highly controversial bill concerning the rights of public school students and their parents, Democrats denied a Republican lawmaker’s motion to reject the version passed by the Senate for not comporting with House rules.
When the presiding speaker, Rep. Tarra Simmons, D-Bremerton, issued the ruling, Dufault leapt up and angrily shouted his disagreement.
“It was the last straw. It was more intense,” House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-West Seattle said Friday. “A lot of members were anxious about his mental state and whether that could be a physical threat.”
Lawmakers in both parties said privately that at that moment, they feared Dufault might be armed and something worse might occur. Dufault said in an interview Thursday, he has a permit to carry a concealed weapon but had no weapons on the floor.
Following the episode, floor proceedings in the House paused for about two to three hours, and Washington State Patrol officers increased their presence in the chamber.
In the House, the Speaker can remove any person creating a disturbance or engaging in disorderly conduct in the chamber. Fitzgibbon said barring Dufault for the rest of the session was a mutual decision with leaders of the House Republican caucus.
Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, R-Auburn, declined requests for comment Thursday. On Friday, a spokesperson sent an email saying Stokesbary “is not going to comment on internal caucus discussions.”
Dufault said Thursday night he learned of the ban in a text from his caucus leader. He said he was working virtually from an office in the legislative building.
“I will always speak passionately. I will always speak directly,” he said. “I believe that my tone is appropriate and measured.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1014-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-04-25 18:06:01.975425

She was scheduled to make an initial appearance in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries at 10:30 on Friday.

Online court records show that the government did not request that Dugan be held in detention and that she was released on an O/R bond, meaning she was released from custody without having to post bail and signed an agreement that she’d appear in court when required.

The agency’s director, Kash Patel, wrote on the social media platform X that Dugan had “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. In the now-deleted post, Patel accused Dugan of creating “increased danger to the public.”
Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 for a pre-trial conference on charges of misdemeanor domestic battery. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents appeared outside Dugan’s courtroom, she led Flores-Ruiz and an attorney out a side door and down a private hallway.
ICE agents later apprehended Flores-Ruiz on foot. This is the third time since March that immigration agents have appeared at the Milwaukee County courthouse to conduct arrests — a tactic that local officials have said threatens to undermine the work of the local justice system by making immigrants fearful of coming to the courthouse to testify in court.
In an initial statement, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said he was aware of Dugan’s arrest and that the legal process should be allowed to play out.
“Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process,” Crowley said. “We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.”
But later, he accused the FBI of politicizing the arrest to punish perceived enemies.
“It is clear that the FBI is politicizing this situation to make an example of her and others across the country who oppose their attack on the judicial system and our nation’s immigration laws,” he said. “FBI Director Kash Patel issued a public statement on X, which he hurriedly deleted, making unsubstantiated claims about Judge Dugan’s case before charges were officially filed and she could have her moment in court. Director Patel’s statement shows that Trump’s FBI is more concerned about weaponizing federal law enforcement, punishing people without due process, and intimidating anyone who opposes those policies, than they are with seeking justice.”
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said the administration of President Donald Trump is attacking democratic values.
“In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons,” she said. “The President’s administration arresting a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move, and it threatens to breach those very separations of power. Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a Democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by. By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic Democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line. While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this President’s lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress’s checks on his power.”
Gov. Tony Evers said the arrest was another example of the Trump administration’s attacks on the judiciary.
“Unfortunately, we have seen in recent months the president and the Trump Administration repeatedly use dangerous rhetoric to attack and attempt to undermine our judiciary at every level, including flat-out disobeying the highest court in the land and threatening to impeach and remove judges who do not rule in their favor,” he said. “I have deep respect for the rule of law, our nation’s judiciary, the importance of judges making decisions impartially without fear or favor, and the efforts of law enforcement to hold people accountable if they commit a crime. I will continue to put my faith in our justice system as this situation plays out in the court of law.”
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) said the arrest was “shocking.”
“This Administration’s willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach,” Moore said. “Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require a high legal bar. I will be following this case closely and facts will come out, however, I am very alarmed at the increasingly lawless actions of the Trump Administration, and in particular ICE, who have been defying courts and acting with disregard for the Constitution.”
The ACLU of Wisconsin wrote on social media that ICE making arrests at courthouses interferes with the work of local justice officials.
“Judges have a duty to maintain order in their courtrooms and ensure the fair administration of justice, and federal law does not require state judges to act as agents of federal immigration enforcement,” the organization said. “Everyone is due their day in court, and when ICE starts showing up to courts looking to make arrests, it risks interfering with those rights. In recent weeks, the administration has attacked the integrity of our judicial system, refused to comply with a Supreme Court order, and arrested a judge for using her authority to protect the fair administration of justice.”

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) Three weeks ago, the taps rumbled to life in Thomas Chee’s home. For the first time in his life, water sputtered through his faucet. 
“Oh, it was so beautiful,” said 47-year-old Chee on Friday. “Boy, it just hit me. It hit hard, and I just broke down.” 
Chee is one of the few dozen residents of Westwater, Utah, a small Navajo community in the southwest corner of the state that for years lacked water and electricity. Chee, who currently serves as the community president, has called Westwater home for his entire life. 
He, along with his neighbors, have used outhouses, hauled water with tanks on the back of their trucks, relied on solar electricity and lit kerosene lamps. With his grandmother, Chee would often walk down to a spring in a ravine near his home to get drinking water.

Until now.
For 25 years, residents have been trying to get water. In March, Chee said, “our prayers were answered.” 
On Friday, Westwater residents celebrated alongside Utah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren, Utah GOP Rep. Mike Kennedy and other lawmakers, bureaucrats and tribal leaders. 
“As president, my priority has always been water, water, water,” said Nygren, who took office in 2023. “I grew up without running water. I know what it’s like to haul water. I know what it takes, it’s tough, it’s something that our kids and our relatives shouldn’t be going through.”
Bringing water to Westwater was part of a larger, ongoing effort to expand access to water in Navajo communities. Estimates vary, but somewhere between 30% to 40% of homes on the Navajo Nation, the country’s largest Indian reservation, lack running water. That’s despite Lake Powell and the Colorado River, which supplies drinking water to 40 million people across seven states and Mexico, running along the northern border of the reservation. 
But those communities are mostly rural, tucked away in some of the most remote parts of the lower 48 states. Westwater is not. 
The same ravine where Chee and his family got their drinking water separates Westwater and Blanding, home to about 3,100 people. In minutes, a Westwater resident can get to Blanding’s main street, which has a hospital, a grocery store, a city hall, bank, and a handful of cafes, shops and restaurants. Utah State University’s campus in Blanding is visible from Westwater.  
“I was shocked with how close this community was to Blanding,” Henderson told Utah News Dispatch Friday, describing her first visit to Westwater. “This is a community right here, next to a city. So to me, this challenge was something that I felt was worth taking on.”

Expanding basic utilities to Westwater was less of a logistical issue — which is often the case for the remote communities that dot the Navajo Nation — and more of a jurisdictional issue. 
The land has long been home to Navajo families, and was purchased by the Navajo Nation in 1986. However, it’s “fee simple” land, not reservation land, meaning the residents pay taxes to San Juan County. That’s different from untaxed “trust” land, which makes up most American reservations and is under full control of indigenous people. 
For 25 years, as Westwater residents lobbied for access to water, they were stuck in jurisdictional limbo, caught between the Navajo Nation, the city, county, and state. 
“No one really took ownership, no one took responsibility for the people out here. It wasn’t really the tribe’s responsibility, it wasn’t the county, or the city’s responsibility. So I decided it was the state’s responsibility,” Henderson said. 
Henderson, who gave Westwater a shoutout during her inaugural address earlier this year, said she made improving access to water and electricity a priority.

In 2020, the Utah Legislature appropriated $500,000 to electrify Westwater, matched by a $500,000 donation from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Two years later, Westwater tied into Blanding’s grid and lights flickered on in the 29 lots that make up the small community. That same year, Blanding struck a deal with the state of Utah, the Navajo Nation, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority and San Juan County to bring culinary water to Westwater. 
The Navajo Nation chipped in $5.5 million, and Utah state leaders allocated $3.5 million in American Rescue Plan funds, the $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package passed by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden in 2021. Blanding city leaders changed its ordinances to allow for a well to be drilled, and a coalition of nonprofits, with help from the county, helped raise funds and coordinate the project.  
State officials helped Blanding build an arsenic treatment plant and drill a new well near the spring that divides the city and Westwater. For the last couple years, crews have been building a pipeline into the community. 
By late March, every Westwater resident had potable water flowing through their taps.  
“This project is a testament to what can happen when people come together,” said Logan Monson, the former mayor of Blanding who now serves as a Republican lawmaker in the Utah House. “It is my hope today that this water project will stand as a symbol, a symbol that every person matters. That every community deserves to be seen.” 
Now that the residents have water and electricity, leaders have high hopes for the small city.

“Moving forward, the Westwater community is not going to have those struggles, so that they can focus on some of the things that matter. What else can life provide you when you set yourself up,” Nygren said. 
Chee, standing in the creek where he once helped his grandmother bring water back to their home, echoed the Navajo Nation president. 
“I believe we will thrive. Life has gotten easier,” he said. “We don’t have to worry about hauling, or looking for water. I believe my community will be more productive.” 
Chee spoke over the soft trickle of the spring, pausing as his eyes watered. 
“For many years, we relied on this beautiful water right here. It sustained life. Sorry to be emotional, but water is a real precious resource,” he said. “It’s been a long time coming for my people to have this infrastructure.”

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)The Idaho Supreme Court on Friday heard arguments in a lawsuit that alleges state officials drafted biased and misleading information for voters on an abortion rights ballot initiative. 
Idahoans United for Women and Families, the group behind the ballot initiative, in January sued, alleging ballot titles and financial analysis — developed by state officials for voters to see — are inaccurate. 
“Idahoans need clear and concise information about a proposed ballot initiative’s fiscal impact and its purpose to decide whether to say yes or no at the ballot box — based on their understanding, and not on confusion,” said Anne Henderson Haws, an attorney with the law firm Holland & Hart, which is representing the abortion ballot initiative group. “The fiscal impact statement and the ballot titles prepared for the Reproductive Freedom and Privacy Act fail to meet these standards.”
As Idaho Legislature winds down, Republican lawmakers maintain strict abortion bans

State agencies defend the descriptions — which use “fetus viability” in one reference, and say the initiative will marginally raise state expenses. The agencies, which wrote the ballot titles and fiscal analysis, say they comply with state law.
“To the extent there’s a gap here, I think the gap between their definition and the term fetal variability is worlds larger than the gap between the term fetal viability and fetus viability,” said Idaho Solicitor General Alan Hurst, who works for the Idaho Attorney General’s Office. “And if the two terms are not synonymous — like if fetus favors us slightly, and fetal favors them slightly, which we don’t concede — then why is it that the one that’s in favor wins out, when the statutory standard is you’re not supposed to be either in favor or against?” 
The ballot initiative proposes abortion exemptions to Idaho’s strict abortion ban laws for emergencies, fetal viability and other reproductive health protections.
The court will issue a decision at a later date.
In 2023, the Idaho Supreme Court ordered the Idaho Attorney General’s Office to rewrite ballot titles for an unsuccessful election reform ballot initiative, following a lawsuit.

 Justices grilled AG attorney on using ‘fetus viability’ in ballot title

The ballot titles, developed by the Idaho Office of the Attorney General, are brief descriptions of the initiative.
The short title doesn’t say that the law would allow emergency abortions after viability, Idahoans United spokesperson Melanie Folwell previously told States Newsroom.
And the short title uses the term “fetus viability,” which is not the medical phrase, the initiative group argues. That conflicts with the long title’s use of the term “fetal viability,” the group argues. 
Justices repeatedly asked Idaho’s solicitor general why the attorney general’s office used a different term than the initiative’s policy.
Hurst said the AG’s office believes fetal viability and fetus viability are essentially the same term.

At one point, Justice Robyn Brody questioned whether the language was meant to evoke the broader abortion debate. 
Anti-abortion activists often call fetuses unborn children. But abortion-rights activists often frame abortion in terms of medical freedom for pregnant patients.
Hurst then referenced news writing standards by the Associated Press, a prominent international news wire outlet, that advise against using the terms “pro life” and “pro choice” in news articles. 
“There are no neutral options here. To the extent the neutral options are here, its fetus viability — fetal viability,” Hurst replied. “That’s more favorable to their side than to ours. The AG has not used pro life language in this. He has done his utmost to use language that is consistent with the way the initiative frames things.”
Justice Cynthia Meyer soon pointed out that the Attorney General’s Office’s long title uses the term “life of the unborn child.”
 Fiscal impact statement says initiative will marginally raise state costs. That’s also in dispute. 

The bigger issue is with the fiscal impact statement, Folwell previously told States Newsroom. 
The fiscal impact statement says the initiative wouldn’t affect taxes or the state’s general fund, but it says the initiative could minorly affect state expenses — in Medicaid and prisoner populations.

“Passage of this initiative is likely to cost less than $20,000 per year. The Medicaid budget for providing services was about $850 million in FY2024,” the fiscal impact review said. “If passed, nominal costs in the context of the affected total budget are insignificant to the state.”
Initiative organizers argue that’s not true. 
Justice Colleen Zahn pressed an attorney for Idahoans United on how the initiative wouldn’t raise costs, since Idaho pays for Medicaid patients who need care from complications from abortion pills.
“There’s no evidence that it would increase costs so as to increase any budget that doesn’t already exist,” Henderson Haws said. 
The fiscal analysis was prepared by the Idaho Division of Financial Management, an agency overseen by Idaho Gov. Brad Little. 
 What is the Idaho abortion rights ballot initiative? 

After filing four proposed policies in August, Idahoans United for Women and Families narrowed its focus down to one policy that would establish a fundamental right to contraception and fertility treatments under Idaho law.
That would include:

in vitro fertilization;
making decisions about pregnancy and childbirth; 
legalizing abortion before fetal viability; and
preserving the right to abortion after viability in medical emergencies.

Under the proposed initiative, fetal viability would be determined by a physician and what treatment is available. In the medical community, viability is generally considered to be between 23 to 24 weeks of gestational age.
Initiative organizers are collecting signatures in the hopes of qualifying the initiative to be considered by Idaho voters in the November 2026 general election.
A ballot initiative is a proposed law that Idaho voters can approve or reject — independent of the Idaho Legislature. Only the Legislature can propose constitutional amendments, unlike many other states. 
To pass, the initiative would require a simple majority support from voters.

Both the W and the Walston-Hoover Stadium, which the release stated is also used for recreational programming, are in need of renovations and updates, according to the college. The $5 million ask is tied to the community wellness and recreation initiative branch of “Our Brightest Days: The Campaign for Realizing Purpose and Leading Change,” a Wartburg fundraising campaign with an overall goal of $36 million.
Funds would go toward updating exercise and pool equipment, resurfacing indoor and outdoor tracks, replacing field turf and upgrading a climbing wall, according to the release.
“For nearly two decades, the Ohle Wartburg-Waverly Sports & Wellness Center has stood as a shining example of what can be accomplished when a college and community join forces with a shared vision,” said Sheila Kittleson, The W’s executive director, in the release.
According to the university’s campaign webpage, almost $970,000 of the $5 million goal has already been raised. Other targeted areas the university is fundraising for include scholarship funds, experiential learning opportunities, alumni and career connections and classroom technology upgrades.

Elfer estimated there about 15 to 20 roads underwater in the area. 
A truck sits in high water after the owner parked, then boated to his residence on Chickasaw Road in Vicksburg as a rising Mississippi River causes backwater flooding, Friday, April 25, 2025.
“We’re about half a foot (on the river gauge) from a major flood,” he said. “But we don’t think it’s going to be like in 2011, so we can kind of manage this.”
The National Weather projects the river to crest at 49.5 feet on Monday, making it the highest peak at the Vicksburg gauge since 2020. Elfer said some residents in north Vicksburg — including at the Ford Subdivision as well as near Chickasaw Road and Hutson Street — are having to take boats to get home, adding that those who live on the unprotected side of the levee are generally prepared for flooding.

“There are a few (inundated homes), but we’ve mitigated a lot of them,” he said. “Some of the structures have been torn down or raised. There are a few people that still live on the wet side of the levee, but they kind of know what to expect. So we’re not too concerned with that.”
The river first reached flood stage in the city — 43 feet — on April 14. State officials closed Highway 465, which connects the Eagle Lake community just north of Vicksburg to Highway 61, last Friday.

Elfer said the areas impacted are mostly residential and he didn’t believe any businesses have been affected, emphasizing that downtown Vicksburg is still safe for visitors. He said Warren County has worked with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency to secure pumps and barriers. 
“Everybody thus far has been very cooperative,” he said. “We continue to tell people stay out of the flood areas, don’t drive around barricades and don’t drive around road close signs. Not only is it illegal, it’s dangerous.”
NWS projects the river to stay at flood stage in Vicksburg until May 6. The river reached its record crest of 57.1 feet in 2011.

University of Kentucky President Eli Capilouto announced the reversal following the Trump administration’s Friday decision to restore student visa registrations of foreign students that faced legal challenges. 
In a message to campus issued Friday afternoon, Capilouto said the visas revoked for a small number of international graduate students earlier this month had been restored. On April 4, Capilouto announced the Department of Homeland Security notified UK that the department was revoking some F-1 student visas.
“This week, we learned that this decision has been reversed for those students and their status has been restored,” Capilouto said Friday. “University officials again immediately informed impacted students. Teams from across the university continue to monitor this important issue and any changes.” 
Capilouto said UK administration will continue to update students, faculty and staff about how federal policies will affect campus online. 
International students and graduates at other Kentucky universities — Murray State University, Campbellsville University and the University of Louisville — faced similar situations over the past couple of weeks. A spokesperson for UofL said visas for three recent international graduates have been restored Friday afternoon. Spokespeople for MSU and CU did not immediately return a request for comment Friday afternoon. 
Earlier this week, campus groups and local organizations rallied on MSU’s campus to show support for international students there after a student’s visa was revoked. 
Inside Higher Ed tracked that as of Friday, more than 1,800 international students and graduates across the country had their legal status changed by the U.S. State Department. 
Meanwhile, Capilouto addressed how changing federal policies at large under President Donald Trump are impacting higher education in a report to UK’s board during a Friday meeting. In addition to the revocation of visas for international students, universities across the country are facing pressure to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies or risk losing federal funding. 
At the state level, Kentucky public universities are weighing how to implement a recent state law that seeks to eliminate DEI in higher education. In response to that, UK and UofL canceled graduation ceremonies for students in some minority groups. Capilouto said in his report UK took “that action because we believe that’s what is required” under the law. 
To the board, Capilouto said the administration will be “seeking your guidance on how we can best” navigate this time” over the next few months. 
“How do we comply with the law — and the directives we receive — from policymakers at both the federal state and levels … while, at the same time, working every day to support the people … our students … our staff … our faculty … who make our mission possible?” Capilouto said in his report.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0798-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-25 17:08:28.111147

FBI agents arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on Friday, accusing her of obstructing an immigration enforcement action last week.

She was scheduled to make an initial appearance in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries at 10:30 on Friday. According to a criminal complaint, she’s been charged with obstructing or impeding before a department or agency of the United States and concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest.
Online court records show that the government did not request that Dugan be held in detention and that she was released on an O/R bond, meaning she was released from custody without having to post bail and signed an agreement that she’d appear in court when required.
The agency’s director, Kash Patel, wrote on the social media platform X that Dugan had “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. In the now-deleted post, Patel accused Dugan of creating “increased danger to the public.”
Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 for a pre-trial conference on charges of misdemeanor domestic battery. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents appeared outside Dugan’s courtroom, she led Flores-Ruiz and an attorney out a side door and down a private hallway.
ICE agents later apprehended Flores-Ruiz on foot. This is the third time since March that immigration agents have appeared at the Milwaukee County courthouse to conduct arrests — a tactic that local officials have said threatens to undermine the work of the local justice system by making immigrants fearful of coming to the courthouse to testify in court.
Dugan-Crim-complaint
In an initial statement, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said he was aware of Dugan’s arrest and that the legal process should be allowed to play out.
“Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process,” Crowley said. “We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.”
But later, he accused the FBI of politicizing the arrest to punish perceived enemies.
“It is clear that the FBI is politicizing this situation to make an example of her and others across the country who oppose their attack on the judicial system and our nation’s immigration laws,” he said. “FBI Director Kash Patel issued a public statement on X, which he hurriedly deleted, making unsubstantiated claims about Judge Dugan’s case before charges were officially filed and she could have her moment in court. Director Patel’s statement shows that Trump’s FBI is more concerned about weaponizing federal law enforcement, punishing people without due process, and intimidating anyone who opposes those policies, than they are with seeking justice.”
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said the administration of President Donald Trump is attacking democratic values.
“In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons,” she said. “The President’s administration arresting a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move, and it threatens to breach those very separations of power.”
Gov. Tony Evers said the arrest was another example of the Trump administration’s attacks on the judiciary.
“Unfortunately, we have seen in recent months the president and the Trump administration repeatedly use dangerous rhetoric to attack and attempt to undermine our judiciary at every level, including flat-out disobeying the highest court in the land and threatening to impeach and remove judges who do not rule in their favor,” he said.
The ACLU of Wisconsin wrote on social media that ICE making arrests at courthouses interferes with the work of local justice officials.
“Judges have a duty to maintain order in their courtrooms and ensure the fair administration of justice, and federal law does not require state judges to act as agents of federal immigration enforcement,” the organization said. “Everyone is due their day in court, and when ICE starts showing up to courts looking to make arrests, it risks interfering with those rights.”

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)New Mexico Health officials reported one additional New Mexico measles case Friday, this time an adult in Eddy County, bringing the total reported infections to 66.
The slow drip of cases in recent weeks does not indicate the outbreak is abating, according to New Mexico Department of Health Communications Director Robert Nott, who told Source NM that symptoms can appear a week or more after infections.
“The seemingly slow increase in measles cases in New Mexico should not be taken as a sign we are anywhere near out of the woods with this outbreak,” Nott said in a written statement. “We see continued measles spread in bordering areas — Mexico and Texas, for example — so there is always the potential for a new introduction of cases in New Mexico.”
Nott also noted that cases may rise in coming weeks after recent Easter weekend gatherings, given that “symptoms of measles do not appear until roughly a week (or more) after infection.”
The majority of measles cases in New Mexico remain in Lea County, which has 61 cases; the state has had six hospitalizations since the outbreak began in neighboring Gaines County, Texas, just across the state line. Cases in Doña Ana and Chaves counties remain unchanged, with one reported case each.
Texas health officials on Friday reported cases increased by an additional 22 infections, bringing the total there to 646.
Measles is highly contagious, spread through contact with airborne droplets from an infected person. Infected people can spread the disease several days before symptoms such as fever, red eyes, cough or spotty red rash appear. Two doses of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine offers 97% protection against catching the measles, according to the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control.
While the majority of health professionals continue to recommend two doses of the vaccine as the safest and most effective prevention from contracting measles, a recent poll from nonpartisan health research organization KFF found nearly a quarter of their sample believed false claims about the vaccine.
Poll: Belief in false measles claims correlated with lower vaccination rates

Also this week, researchers from Stanford Medicine published findings that determined if vaccination rates drop further, measles (and other infectious diseases) could return in the U.S. after decades of eradication. Using a mathematical model to simulate the spread of diseases, researchers also found that if vaccination rates remain the same, measles may still make a comeback in the next two decades.
Pediatrician Dr. Melissa Mason told Source NM she sees a measles comeback as a matter of potential life and death.
“With vaccination rates as they stand, without dropping more, we’re still gonna see people get measles — get sick and die from this,” she said.
Mason, who chairs the immunization committee for the New Mexico Pediatric Society, said she’s been impressed with efforts from New Mexico health officials to vaccinate people in the Southeastern corner of the state. Statewide vaccination rates are nearly double from the same time frame last year, according to data released Tuesday.
“These are gold star efforts, and that’s going to make a difference,” she said. “But nationally, in other areas that continue to have lower rates than 95% coverage, we’re going to continue to see measles.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-25 20:56:11+00:00,CT Mirror,Effort underway to seek a pardon for former Gov. John G. Rowland,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/25/ct-john-rowland-trump-pardon/,A discreet effort is underway to explore the possibility of President Donald J. Trump pardoning former Gov. John G. Rowland.,"A discreet effort is underway to explore the possibility of President Donald J. Trump pardoning former Gov. John G. Rowland for his convictions in two federal criminal cases, including one that contributed to his resignation as Connecticut’s governor amid an impeachment inquiry in July 2004. 
“I am aware people are talking about it, probably because the Trump administration has made a strong commitment to doing more pardons including appointing a pardon czar, but I have not made an application for one,” Rowland said Friday in an email.
He declined further comment.
Trump began his second term on Jan. 20, 2025, with a sweeping clemency order for 1,500 people implicated in the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol, and he created a new clemency post a month later, naming Alice Williams as the White House “pardon czar.” 
“You’ve been an inspiration to people, and we’re going to be listening to your recommendation on pardons,” Trump said. 
Williams, 69, had served 21 years in prison on a nonviolent drug crime before Trump commuted her sentence in 2018 and then pardoned her in 2020 hours after she addressed the Republican National Convention. Still, the path to a pardon is not clearly mapped, as evidenced by calls on Rowland’s behalf.
Fred Camillo, the first selectman of Greenwich, said he recently was approached about whether he could recommend anyone capable of furthering the cause of a Rowland pardon. Camillo attributed the call to the perception that an elected CEO in Greenwich must have valuable contacts.
Camillo declined to identify the caller.
“We get these calls all the time,” said Camillo, a Republican elected as first selectman in 2019. He is a former state representative first elected to the House in 2008, four years after Rowland resigned as governor. “I certainly know people in the administration.”
One of Trump’s cabinet officers, Education Secretary Linda McMahon, is from Greenwich. But Camillo was uncertain as to whether he could help make a contact with McMahon.
The White House had no immediate comment.
Rowland’s friendship with the Bush family presumably would be of no help with a pardon, given Trump’s disdain of a political dynasty with roots in Greenwich, which also was Trump’s home during his first marriage.
“We need another Bush in office about as much as we need Obama to have a 3rd term,” Trump wrote in 2013. “No more Bushes!”
But the president has been sympathetic to politicians who claim their prosecutions were politically motivated. A case in point: his commutation and eventual pardon of Rod Blagojevich, the former Democratic governor of Illinois.
He was convicted in 2011 on charges related to trying to sell an appointment to the U.S. Senate, a vacancy created by Barack Obama’s election as president. Blagojevich had served eight years of a 14-year sentence when Trump commuted his sentence in 2020. 
Trump, who had faced federal indictments related to the Jan. 6 effort to overturn the 2020 election and mishandling of classified documents, expressed a certain solidarity with Blagojevich in signing a pardon in February.
“I’ve watched him. He was set up by a lot of bad people, some of the same people I had to deal with,” Trump said.
Rowland was elected to Congress at age 27 in 1984 and to the first of his three terms as governor in 1994.
Facing impeachment and a federal investigation into bid-rigging involving gifts and favors from state contractors, Rowland resigned July 1, 2004, and pleaded guilty to a corruption charge Dec. 23, 2004. Three months later, he was sentenced to a year and a day in prison, ultimately serving 10 months.
In speeches after his release, Rowland blamed his fall on a “sense of entitlement” and an “arrogance of power.” In one talk to students, he called his fall surreal, saying it seemed he was visiting George W. Bush in the White House one day then standing in line for toilet paper in prison the next.
He was indicted a second time in 2014, accused of soliciting congressional candidates in 2010 and 2012 to secretly pay him as a consultant in campaigns for his old 5th Congressional District seat.
Mark Greenberg rebuffed him in 2010, but Lisa Wilson-Foley agreed to secretly pay for his help in 2012, arranging for her husband’s nursing home company to disguise $35,000 in campaign expenditures to Rowland as a business expense. The government said Wilson-Foley wanted Rowland’s help without the public disclosure required by federal campaign finance laws.
At the time he was secretly working for Wilson-Foley’s campaign, he was the host of a popular evening drive-time show on WTIC-AM. He was convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison.
Rowland, now 67, raised money for the Prison Fellowship after his second release. He was among the VIP mourners at the recent funeral of his former lieutenant and successor, M. Jodi Rell.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3192.jpg,,,2025-04-25 17:08:28.111147

Montpelier’s Kellogg-Hubbard Library is poised to celebrate its own flood recovery milestone one week later.
Read the story on VTDigger here:   ‘Time to do something different’: Johnson’s library to roll across town, out of the floodplain, on Saturday.","The Johnson Public Library awaits its move across town, decorated with painted boards celebrating libraries covering its windows. “Rewriting our story” reads a banner hanging from the roof. Photo courtesy of Charlotte (Lotty) Roozekrans.In the early hours of Saturday morning, the town of Johnson plans to roll their public library a half-mile through town and across the river to its new home. That’s right: The over-a-century-old brick building is going to roll.The move is designed to take the library out of the floodplain, where it has been damaged by high waters again and again since its construction in 1909. According to Library Director Jeanne Engel, the building has been hit with around 15 floods, large and small, during her 25-plus-year career. Despite previous mitigation efforts, the July 2023 flood hit the town and its library particularly hard.“We are not just jacking up and rolling the physical building down the street … we are creating a new heart of Johnson that is free from the risk of flooding,” Town Administrator Thomas Galinat wrote in a press release about the move. “This is a message for Johnson, and all of Vermont, it is time to do something different.”Johnson Town Administrator Thomas Galinat gestures as he talks about the high water that flooded the town’s public library last July. He visited the building with a reporter on June 6, 2024. File photo by Shaun Robinson/VTDiggerThe town is employing 28 bucket trucks, 60 to 70 construction workers, around a dozen utility workers, four police cruisers, two ambulances and a fire truck to move the library to its new home, a spot right between Johnson’s Elementary School and Legion Field. The process is expected to take all night.On Friday evening, utility workers plan to turn power off and bring lines down to make a clear path for the building. At midnight, the building will begin its journey down to Route 15 and across the Pearl Street Bridge, where streetlights will have been removed: The library is wide enough to hang out over the guardrails. The downtown section of Route 15, a two-lane state highway, is set to be closed at 3 a.m. to make way for the move. Around 9 a.m. on Saturday, Galinat estimated, the library will have just about reached its new home, which was formerly an alumni house for Vermont State University, Galinat said on Thursday. After that building was taken down two decades ago, the vacant lot has been used as an overflow parking lot.Town leaders are asking the greater community to gather in celebration on Legion Field at 11:30 a.m., where the main event is in store: Elementary school children will be pulling the building into place with ropes around noon.‘Rewriting our story’Moving the 40-by-45-foot building out of the floodplain’s reach had always been a pipe dream for library staff and trustees. Following the 2023 flood, however, things were desperate enough that the pipe dream became the solution, Galinat said Thursday.“In the face of increasing weather events and all we’ve lost, we are Rewriting Our Story,” he wrote in the release. “It was the rivers that brought us together to build the mill town of Johnson, (and) it is now time to accept that it is the rivers that are putting our town at risk.”Following Saturday’s move, library trustees plan to proceed with further renovation and construction efforts, with a tentative target date of being in the building by Dec. 31.Jeanne Engel, director of the Johnson Public Library, stands in the library’s temporary location on June 6, 2024. The library’s existing building suffered heavy damage in last summer’s flooding and has yet to be fully reconstructed. File photo by Shaun Robinson/VTDiggerThe project is funded by a $1.68 million grant from the Vermont Department of Libraries. In addition to the move and restoration work, library trustees plan to make new space for community meeting rooms, a computer lab and private areas for telehealth services. According to a community donation site, part of the library will remain open after regular hours for community events, meetings and programs.Engel, the library director, learned of the grant opportunity less than a month before it was due, she said, and a group of community volunteers put together the application in two weeks.Galinat recalled the moment when the volunteers sat down and divided up pieces of the 10-page grant application to work on — including the backstory, potential future programming, contacting engineers and the Agency of Transportation. It was “probably the most beautiful moment” in his municipal career, he said.“Really anything is truly possible in a time of need —” Galinat said.“— when you have a community,” Engel added.Even now, it’s the community that’s coordinating the move, as the renovation project does not have a general contractor and is not yet out to bid.“This is literally a community effort moving a building across town,” Galinat said.The 2023 flood devastated more than just the library, however. The town’s wastewater treatment plant filled with eight feet of water along with the post office, the first floor of the municipal office building and Johnson’s sole grocery store.The village trustees have voted to restore the sewage plant in its current location, Galinat said Thursday. However, the town is still working to move more of Johnson’s downtown out of the floodplain. There have been preliminary conversations about moving the municipal building, he said.‘Restored and reimagined’Meanwhile, in Montpelier, the same July 2023 flood destroyed 5,000 donated books, the library’s main control systems and caused leaking from oil tanks at the Kellogg-Hubbard Library. Renovations have been ongoing, and a grand opening of the library’s basement is planned for May 3.According to a press release, the “restored and reimagined” lower level will hold the library’s year-round book sale, new meeting rooms and a dedicated break room for staff. In addition, it will be the new home for Elevate Youth Services’ basement teen center.According to Sarah Wisner, operations and communications coordinator for the library, the flood recovery work cost $2 million and was funded through insurance, donors and the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster funding. The work was done with an eye toward flood resiliency, the press release said.Both public libraries are looking forward to their future — one hopefully free of flooding“We are thrilled to welcome everyone back into our restored space,” Kellogg-Hubbard Library Executive Director Dan Groberg said in the press release. “It’s a chance to come together, reflect on how far we’ve come, and look forward to an exciting future for our Library community.”Read the story on VTDigger here:   ‘Time to do something different’: Johnson’s library to roll across town, out of the floodplain, on Saturday.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Johnson-Public-Library-2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-25 17:08:28.111147

Kelly Armstrong gives a student the pen he used to sign a bill establishing cellphone-free public schools during a signing ceremony April 15, 2025, at Bismarck's Centennial Elementary. He was joined by first lady Kjersti Armstrong. (Photo provided by governor's office)North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong went to a Bismarck elementary school Friday to sign a bill banning public school student cellphone use from “bell to bell.”
“This is a game changer for our public schools, giving students the freedom to focus on learning and to interact with teachers and friends without the constant tug of their cell phones and addictive social media,” Armstrong said in a statement.
House Bill 1160 would require public school districts to have policies requiring student cellphones be silenced and locked away during the entire school day on school grounds. The devices, including bluetooth-enabled devices, tablets, smartwatches or other wearable devices and gaming devices, must be stored in a lockable pouch, phone locker or other inaccessible locations.
The law allows students to use their phones while privately traveling to an off-site educational location, such as a career and technology center. It also allows school districts to craft their own cellphone-use policy during school-related noninstructional time, such as bus rides, field trips, sporting events and school dances.
Student cellphone bills pass North Dakota Legislature; bell-to-bell ban comes back

Students with medical needs that require an electronic monitoring device and students participating in individual education programs may be exempted from the law.
School districts will also be required to collect data and compile a report on the impact of its cellphone policies on student behavior, mental health, disciplinary incidents, school attendance and academic performance during the interim.
State Superintendent Kirsten Baesler said teachers have told her that student mental health challenges have become more “overwhelming.”
“This law gives students the gift of attention, connection, and presence. We are removing the constant pull of comparison and distraction and replacing it with space to learn and grow,” Baesler said in a statement.
The new law will go into effect Aug. 1.
Lawmakers also are considering Senate Bill 2354, which would also restrict student cellphone use in private schools. The bill is being debated in a conference committee between the House and Senate. The next committee meeting is scheduled for Monday morning.

Kristin McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) was sworn into the 119th U.S. Congress, resigning from her role as the Senator for Michigan’s 35th District. 
While McDonald Rivet’s seat has sat vacant for more than three months, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, has been sparse on the details of when the seat may be filled, as Republicans put forth a clarion call demanding a special election. 
“The other side likes to talk about threats to Democracy. The threat to Democracy is no representation here in Midland, Bay and Saginaw County,” Rep. Bill G. Schuette told audience members during Vice President J.D. Vance’s visit to Bay City on March 14. 
Alongside Republicans’ calls to fill the vacant seat, residents of the district have made their concerns known, traveling to Lansing on the date of the governor’s State of the State speech to demand a special election on the steps of the state Capitol.

On Thursday the nonpartisan voting rights group Common Cause joined the call, emphasizing that it is the governor’s duty to set a special election and general election dates, and noting that she’d previously called similar elections without dallying. The group’s Executive Director Quentin Turner suggested in a statement that the Legislature may need to take action to prevent further delays. 
While spokespeople for Whitmer did not respond to an emailed request for comment, the governor told WCMU on April 3 that her team was still reviewing dates, saying “At some point there will be one, but I don’t have an announcement to make yet.”
In an op-ed for the Detroit News, Senate Minority Leader and candidate for governor Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), said Whitmer has called 10 special elections across her six years in office, averaging about 17 days in fulfilling her constitutional obligation to call an election.

He further noted that Whitmer had called the special election to replace outgoing state Reps. Kevin Coleman (D-Westland) and Lori Stone (D-Warren) without delay. 
When Stone and Coleman won their mayoral elections in 2023, Democrats held a slim two-seat majority over Republicans. However, Coleman and Stone’s resignation left the House in a 54-54 deadlock until Reps. Mai Xiong (D-Warren) and Peter Herzberg were elected in April of last year. 
Speaking to the Michigan Advance on Friday, Turner noted that Democrats in the Michigan Senate currently hold a one-seat majority. While he could not speak to the governor’s motivations, the optics come across fairly partisan, Turner said. 
Calling a special election in the swing seat could see Democrats yielding further ground to Republicans, who took control of the Michigan House in the 2024 election, ending Democrats’ trifecta control of the House, Senate and governor’s office. If a Republican candidate claims victory in a special election, the chamber would be split 19-19.
While Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, a Democrat and president of the Senate, can break the tie in any party-line vote; all members must be present and voting. If any member is absent, a 19-18 vote on the bills would leave Gilchrist unable to vote, killing any legislation that fails to achieve a 20 vote majority.

Adrian Hemond, a Democratic consultant and the CEO and Chair of Grassroots Midwest in Lansing said it’s not uncommon for governors to play politics with when they call special elections as the Michigan Constitution gives them incredible broad discretion on when to do so.
“Whether this is a political or partisan decision to delay, it self-evidently is,” Hemond said. 
“If you proceed under the assumption that Republicans are quite likely to win a special election in this district, that means, functionally, that calling the special election is equivalent to giving away your Senate majority,” Hemond said. 
While Democrats could win the 35th Senate District, given McDonald Rivet’s 2022 victory, they would need the right candidate, as the seat has trended away from Democrats in recent election cycles, Hemond said.
Ultimately, Whitmer will call a special election when the political price for not calling the election is higher than the price for calling it, Hemond said, and Michigan Republicans have a long way to go to make that happen. 
In his op-ed, Nesbitt played on the themes of bipartisanship collaboration Whitmer expressed in her state of the state address, calling on her to work with whoever the next senator may be. 
“It should not be up to her or me or any other single elected official to determine if the state Senate operates with a new 19-19 tie or returns to a 20-18 split for the remainder of the current legislative term. That is a question for the voters of the 35th District,” Nesbitt said. 
In the meantime, nearly 270,000 residents have been left without representation as the Legislature continues to hold hearings and vote on bills. 
“There are a number of extremely important pieces of legislation that are moving through the House and the Senate in Lansing this year,” Turner said.
While lawmakers take up legislation that includes a proposal from State Rep. Bryan Posthumus (R-Rockford) that would place a Constitutional amendment requiring voters to show proof of citizenship when registering to vote and casting their ballot, Turner said Michigan voters deserve to have someone in Lansing advocating for them and their right to vote, alongside their other rights. 
Looking to legislative solutions, creating a hard timeline for calling a special election would be a good place to start, Turner said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_20250314_104536406-scaled-e1745613253510-1024x771.jpg,,,2025-04-25 17:08:28.111147

(Photo by ICE)Immigration rights advocates plan to gather outside the federal building and courthouse in downtown Providence at noon Sunday to protest the Trump administration’s mass deportation policies.
The demonstration follows the detention of a man who was hospitalized Thursday after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents who came to his Providence home. Officers allegedly used a stun gun and the unnamed man appeared to have a medical episode and was taken to Rhode Island Hospital for treatment, said Maya Lehrer, an organizer with the Rhode Island Deportation Defense Coalition.
A crowd of 85 people protested outside Rhode Island Hospital for over three hours. The coalition says an attorney for the man was denied entrance to see him.
“Deportations are not new to Trump,” Lehrer said Friday. “But this particular kind of fearmongering and extreme racism has come along with it, and ICE feels empowered to do whatever they have to outside the legal means to seize our community members.” 
Lehrer said the coalition received a call around 11:08 a.m. Thursday reporting that a man was being detained by ICE agents at his home on Parade Street. At some point, officers used a stun gun and the unnamed man suffered a medical episode.



 
City spokesperson Josh Estrella confirmed the Providence Fire Department responded to a call for service on Parade Street for a person who had been tased, but said officials are unaware of any details of the investigation by any federal agency. 
Providence Police were not involved in the detainment, as Mayor Brett Smiley’s administration has made it clear that city officers will not act as immigration agents.
“We’re never going to collaborate, and we’re never going to interfere,” Estrella said.
ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Among the demonstrators gathered outside the hospital Thursday afternoon, was Providence City Council Chief of Staff June Rose, who attended on behalf of Council President Rachel Miller, whose ward includes the address where the man was detained by ICE.
“This community will not stand idly by as the Trump administration disappears our neighbors off the street,” Rose said in an interview Friday. “ICE shouldn’t be in our city at all.”
Shortly after the man arrived at Rhode Island Hospital, Central Falls-based immigration attorney Kelvin Santos said he was contacted to represent him. However, Santos said he was denied the opportunity to meet with his client, despite the man having signed a form confirming Santos as his legal representative.
“ICE wasn’t allowing us to go and see him and the hospital wasn’t trying to supersede what ICE was saying,” he said.
Brown University Health spokesperson Kelly Brennan declined to comment on the case, citing patient privacy.
“Rhode Island Hospital is committed to providing care to all our patients,” Brennan said in an emailed statement. “We follow the same protocols for all patients, including those concerning patient rights and access.”
Lehrer said multiple demonstrators had called ICE and claimed federal officials “seemed alarmed” when told that the man was denied his legal right to counsel. 
Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos issued a statement Thursday evening saying she and her office were “closely monitoring” the situation and called on ICE to immediately allow the man they detained to speak with his attorney.
“The rights enshrined in our Constitution, especially the right to due process, are our only safeguard against authoritarianism,” Matos said. “If we do not immediately and vocally protect the first people to be stripped of those rights, then eventually all people will be stripped of those rights.”
Thursday’s demonstration wrapped up around 4 p.m., the same time Rose said the man was discharged by the hospital. He now remains in ICE custody, but Santos said his client’s whereabouts are unknown.
“It’s in limbo right now,” Santos said. “We’re going to do our best to get in contact with him.”
The coalition claimed the man was taken in an unmarked van being driven by officers from the Wyatt Detention Center in Central Falls. But Wyatt officer Jim Louis told Rhode Island Current that no vans from the facility were dispatched to Rhode Island Hospital on Thursday.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)About 20,000 opioid overdose prevention kits will be distributed across South Dakota thanks to a partnership between the state and Sioux Falls-based nonprofit Emily’s Hope. The kits are filled with naloxone, an antidote for opioid overdoses, along with other resources and information.
Emily’s Hope founder and CEO Angela Kennecke, whose daughter died from a fentanyl overdose in 2018, announced the partnership in Sioux Falls on Friday alongside South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley, state Health Department Secretary Melissa Magstadt and state Social Services Department Secretary Matt Althoff.
The distribution is funded with $350,000 of South Dakota’s $78.6 million “and counting” in national opioid settlement funds, Jackley said. The national opioid settlements were reached to resolve opioid litigation against pharmaceutical distributors and manufacturers accused of flooding communities with opioid painkillers even though they allegedly knew how addictive and deadly the drugs were.
South Dakota will receive about $50 million over the next 15 years from the first settlement and will receive another $28.6 million over the next 17 years from a settlement with Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, Teva and Allergan.
“That’s what is so important about this partnership is it’s putting those dollars back to work to save and protect people,” Jackley said.

Teva pharmaceuticals donated 2,313 kits for the effort and sold the other kits at a discounted rate to the state.
Ninety-five South Dakotans died from overdoses in 2023, according to the state Department of Health. Forty-seven of the deaths were opioid-related, and 39 of those were fentanyl-related, Magstadt said. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid.
“Since 2019, we’ve had a 70% increase in the amount of fentanyl deaths in South Dakota,” Magstadt said. “It’s hitting home.”
The program will target areas of the state impacted the most by opioid use, overdoses and death, officials said. The top 10 counties impacted, according to Emily’s Hope, are Minnehaha, Lincoln, Pennington, Corson, Roberts, Turner, Todd, Oglala Lakota, Beadle and Meade.
Although most overdose deaths are among white residents, Native Americans are disproportionately affected. Native Americans die from overdoses at a rate of 26.6 per 100,000 — more than four times the rate among white South Dakotans, according to the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System.
The kits will be placed in publicly accessible areas, Kennecke said. Emily’s Hope has been distributing naloxone kits, primarily in the Sioux Falls area, for nearly a year. The organization has distributed about 6,000 kits in that time.
Although most overdoses occur in private residences, they also happen in public restrooms, in traffic or on the street, Kennecke said. Offering them in public allows more bystanders to access the drug and intervene.
“Our goal is to have one of these kits in every house, in every business, by every AED possible,” Kennecke said. AEDs are automated external defibrillators that help people in cardiac arrest, many of which are stationed in public areas and offices throughout the state.

Magstadt called naloxone a “one more chance” medicine, since it halts overdose symptoms and opens a window for people to seek treatment for opioid use disorder. Administering naloxone will not harm someone who isn’t experiencing overdose, she said, and victims often appear sleepy while overdosing from opioid use.
The state has distributed about 15,000 naloxone kits in the last eight years to law enforcement, emergency medical services and schools across the state using a federal grant. About 3,600 kits have been distributed to public spaces through the new program so far.
South Dakota’s current plan in the Department of Social Services is to put a majority of settlement dollars into a trust fund to gain interest over time. Althoff said he wants to ensure the money is spent wisely rather than “spend this precious resource for the sake of spending.”
Jackley told South Dakota Searchlight he doesn’t agree with the trust fund approach and he’d rather see the funds be put toward prevention and treatment immediately. That includes funneling some of the settlement money toward rehabilitation for South Dakota prisoners, he said.
“Today, there was a minimal amount of money used from that settlement to save lives,” Jackley said. “We need to do more of that.”

CHICAGO — Just one day into her campaign to replace retiring Sen. Dick Durbin in the U.S. Senate, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton on Friday received a key endorsement from Gov. JB Pritzker, nearly eight years after he first tapped her to be his running mate.

Standing outside the Bright Star Church amid a backdrop of supporters in her native Bronzeville neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side, Stratton on Friday framed herself as a Democrat who would take on the role of “fighter” against President Donald Trump’s administration.

The lieutenant governor criticized tech billionaire-turned-White House adviser Elon Musk as the president’s “unelected sidekick” and blamed them both for creating “a constant state of crisis” since taking power in January.

“While middle class families are stuck facing the consequences of Trump's chaos, too many in Washington are refusing to fight back,” Stratton said. “They're using the same old playbook that they've always used, and it's not working.”

Asked later whether she was referring to Durbin or his contemporaries like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, Stratton demurred, praising Durbin as a “true statesman” and saying she was “grateful for his leadership.”

“But you heard him say that it is time to pass the torch,” she said, referring to Durbin’s announcement Wednesday that he wouldn’t run for a sixth term. ""It's time to bring in new energy, new leadership, new vision, new voices. And that's exactly what I'm doing.”

Pritzker stood next to Stratton and referred to the lieutenant governor as his “partner in governance while we've achieved big things for Illinois.”

“Illinois deserves a United States senator who knows how to fight for us, a senator who will never cower when the moment calls for courage, a senator who will stand up when the White House says to bend the knee, a senator who loves her country and the working people who are its backbone,” Pritzker said.

The billionaire governor, who self-funded both his gubernatorial campaigns and has in recent years spent money on national political efforts as he flirts with the possibility of a White House run, declined to say Friday how much financial backing he’d give Stratton. While he dryly noted to reporters that the limit for individual campaign contributions for federal office is $3,500, there are other routes to funnel serious money into a Senate race.

Pritzker praised Stratton as a “champion for women’s rights, for job creation, for rural families, for farmers, for criminal justice, for early childhood education.” He credited the lieutenant governor as having played an integral role in his administration’s last six years.

“She governs with a zeal that few elected leaders can match, fueled by her lived experience as her mother's primary caregiver, as a mother herself and as a compassionate advocate for people,” Pritzker said.

Stratton often says her interest in politics stems from serving as her mother’s primary caretaker in a battle with Alzheimer’s disease.

The lieutenant governor has quickly risen through the ranks in Illinois politics, having barely served seven months in the Illinois House before she was announced as Pritzker's running mate in August 2017.

Her professional background includes working in administrative law for state agencies and as director of the University of Illinois Chicago’s Center for Public Safety and Justice.

But in political circles, her 2016 candidacy for the Illinois House shook up Springfield. Backed by then-House Speaker Michael Madigan’s political operation, Stratton unseated incumbent Democratic Rep. Ken Dunkin, who’d upset his own party by siding with then-Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner during a two-year budget impasse.

The 2016 Stratton-Dunkin face-off set spending records and even saw President Barack Obama get involved, endorsing Stratton.

Next year’s Democratic primary for Durbin’s Senate seat is already poised to get expensive. The Democratic Lieutenant Governor’s Association endorsed Stratton Thursday and announced it will spend at least $1 million to support her campaign.

Stratton also launched the Level Up federal political action committee in January, giving her a financial mechanism to influence federal campaigns or support her own run for office, as federal campaign finance rules prohibit the use of state campaign money for federal campaigns. The committee has not reported any fundraising as of Friday.

While Stratton was first out of the gate, other prominent Illinois Democrats are expected to enter the race. Durbin told reporters at his Springfield home Thursday he’s heard from several people interested in running for his seat.

“I’m not planning on endorsing any particular candidate,” Durbin said. “I hope I don’t have to but I’m not ruling out the possibility in an extreme case. I just think it’s up to the voters, the Democratic voters, to make this choice moving forward.”

Schaumburg Democratic U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, for example, spent Thursday on a three-stop tour in Chicago, Bloomington and Urbana — all outside his suburban district — focused on the impact of Trump’s tariffs. Krishnamoorthi has more than $19 million in his campaign account and told CNN Friday morning that he’d be making an announcement about his intentions for 2026 “shortly.”

Other expected Democratic hopefuls include U.S. Reps. Lauren Underwood of Naperville and Robin Kelly of Matteson. Durbin backed Kelly during her brief stint leading the Democratic Party of Illinois until she was ousted by Pritzker allies who installed state Rep. Lisa Hernandez, D-Cicero, in the role in 2022.

(Getty Images)Leaders from New Jersey’s four regulated utilities told a joint legislative panel Friday that the state could take greater steps to build power generation capacity and cautioned against some cost-saving proposals lawmakers have floated as ratepayers prepare for a double-digit utility bill hike this June.
Representatives of PSE&G, Jersey Central Power and Light, Rockland Electric Company, and Atlantic City Electric expressed willingness to play a role in electricity generation and billing changes that could spread high bills across multiple billing cycles. But they warned that lawmakers’ proposals to lower utility profitability or break with the state’s grid operator could do more harm than good.
“We recognize that this unfortunate increase will be delivered to our customers through bills with our name on it. This means whatever the facts are — and the facts are we are not responsible for this increase — we are involved. We recognize it and intend to be part of the solution,” said Richard Thigpen, senior vice president at PSE&G.
They warned against lowering utilities’ return on equity — the rate negotiated with state regulators at which they are allowed to profit on their investments — saying it could limit investor interest in New Jersey’s electric providers and imperil utilities’ ability to upgrade infrastructure in the long run.
In New Jersey, return on equity rates typically hover around 9.6% — for every dollar they invest, they receive $1.096 back from ratepayers — and can be supplemented by incentives at the federal level that lawmakers are considering blocking.
“Investors — if they’re not seeing the return that they’re looking for as part of that investment in us, they may choose to go elsewhere and invest their money elsewhere,” said Phil Vavala, region president for Atlantic City Electric. “That then could create the detrimental effect that ultimately would lead to investor disinterest that ultimately would then affect our ability to invest in the system.”
Joining a new grid operator would be no guarantee that ratepayers would get lower costs, they also warned.
“I think I would have a concern unless I was 100% sure that it would benefit the customers,” Alex Stern, an official with Exelon, the parent company of Atlantic City Electric. “I don’t know how it gets done in a way that doesn’t make it worse for the customer financially.”
New Jersey’s status as a net importer of energy and the continued loss of in-state net power generation as existing plants go offline pose significant hurdles to a break with New Jersey’s grid operator.
Democratic legislators have increasingly sought to blame PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for New Jersey, 12 other states, and Washington D.C., for the spike in electricity costs, which is expected to add roughly $25 to a typical customer’s monthly electricity bill beginning on June 1. Gov. Phil Murphy last week asked federal regulators to investigate whether there had been any “market manipulation” that led to the price spike.
 Sen. Bob Smith (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
Sen. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex) renewed attacks against the interconnector Friday, charging without evidence that its voting members had colluded to push up energy capacity prices at a PJM-run capacity auction in July.
“I’d really like to know who sent the memo around, ‘Let’s everybody bid 10 times higher than last year.’ If that doesn’t smell like collusion, I don’t know what does,” he said.
Republican lawmakers have pointed to Murphy’s ambitious renewable energy goals as a cause of rising prices. That plan has focused chiefly on offshore wind farms, but each of those projects has been abandoned by developers or frozen by executive orders and other regulatory actions by the Trump administration.
Industry officials have said lower energy supply coupled with harsher weather and a steep spike in demand driven by artificial intelligence data centers after years of relatively stable electricity needs have driven bills and prices upward.
Utility officials said New Jersey could seek more in-state generation through legislative action or a bid process like the one used for the stalled wind projects.
Thigpen said the PSE&G had “almost zero confidence” that higher electricity prices alone would incent the development of more in-state generation.
New Jersey in 1999 deregulated energy generation in hopes that competition would bring down prices in what, before then, was a monopolized market. Since then, the regulated utilities — called electric distribution companies — have increasingly withdrawn from generation, preferring to transmit power generated by others across the infrastructure they own.
At present, only PSE&G, which operates nuclear plants in Salem County that account for roughly 40% of New Jersey’s in-state generation, creates any electricity in New Jersey, though representatives from all four regulated utilities expressed willingness to play a bigger role in generation Friday.
The timelines, costs, and political uncertainties associated with new generation make nuclear an unattractive power source to provide relief in the short term, Thigpen said.
Such projects take about a decade and billions of dollars to stand up, he said, and could lay at the whims of a future administration or Legislature. If a nuclear project approved under one administration was blocked by a subsequent one, the utility’s investment would be in a precarious position, he noted.
“Now, we’ve spent several billion dollars, and the state is no longer behind it,” Thigpen said, speaking hypothetically. “That is what I would call political risk.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma State University’s governing board on Friday appointed Jim Hess to serve as the school’s 20th president for the next three years.
Oklahoma State University A&M Board of Regents said in a statement that Hess, who had been serving as interim president, has proven he’s the right person to lead the state’s second largest university. 
The board’s statement did not say why Hess was appointed for only a three-year term.  
“Dr. Hess has proven himself as the right leader at the right time for Oklahoma State University,” said Board Chairman Jimmy Harrel. “His deep understanding of OSU’s land-grant mission gives our board complete confidence in his ability to lead the university forward.”
The board had tapped Hess to serve as interim president in February following the abrupt resignation of Kayse Shrum, the university’s first female president. Officials have not said what led Shrum to step down after slightly more than three years at the helm. 
“While we could have spent an entire year searching for a new president, seeing Jim’s work up close over the past months has provided a level of insight and confidence that no interviews with outside candidates would have yielded,” said Rick Walker, the board’s vice chair. “His positive impact across the OSU community has been swift. He immediately took action on key issues and legislative priorities, and his engagement with OSU’s students, faculty, and staff has restored much-needed connections and stability throughout the institution.”
Hess brings 43 years of experience working in higher education to the role. He most recently served as vice provost for graduate programs at the OSU Center for Health Sciences. 
He earned a bachelor’s and master’s from Northeastern State University and a doctorate in education from OSU.
Hess said he was honored and excited about the university’s future.
“We launch this journey with an urgency of purpose and the confidence that we can change lives, transform education, and pave the way for the next generation of Cowboys,” Hess said.

Jon Ossoff faced pointed questions from fired Centers for Disease Control and Prevention workers and others at a Marietta town hall meeting Friday.
The Atlanta-based CDC has seen mass layoffs as part of the Trump administration’s widespread government cuts.
Frustrated former employees at the town hall said the firings are misguided and will harm public health. Several members of a group called Fired but Fighting said Ossoff is not doing enough to help.
  Fired CDC worker Abby Tighe questions Sen. Ossoff. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“We want to know why we have gotten no response from your staff,” asked Abby Tighe, a former public health advisor in the CDC’s division of overdose prevention who was let go in February. “We are a huge coalition. We have emailed, we have called, we have tried many times to meet with you and your staff to talk about the concerns that we have from public health, and we have been ignored. We are a huge constituency and we protect you and everyone else in this room from public health disaster.”
Tighe also asked what Ossoff will do as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee to help fund public health.
“Let me say that this is what democracy is all about, folks, and I welcome tough questions,” Ossoff said. “I welcome criticism. I ask to be held accountable. That’s the purpose of events like this, and unlike some of my colleagues, we have not pre-screened these questions. I’m not reading them from a list that my staff gave me. We’re opening it up to my constituents.”
That last part was a dig at Rome Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who held a town hall not far from Marietta last week and is reportedly considering a run for Ossoff’s seat when he is up for re-election next year.
Ossoff’s seat is seen as one of the most vulnerable in the nation and his race is expected to be expensive, hard-fought and close.
Ossoff told the Fired but Fighting members that he supports them and pledged to meet with them in the coming days to discuss how to provide further assistance.
  Sen. Jon Ossoff. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“CDC accounts, other (Health and Human Services) public health accounts, and global health accounts will be among my priorities on the Appropriations Committee – provided we can get bipartisan cooperation to do an actual budget,” he said. “You’ll recall what happened just a couple of months ago, when, on a partisan basis, Republicans in Congress basically signed a blank check for the administration. I will work to avoid that. I will work to make sure that CDC funding, HHS public health funding, and global health funding are robust and protected, and I will continue to do everything I can to hold accountable (United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.) and the new leadership of CDC for these outrageous cuts to the CDC’s workforce, which put the American people at risk.”
Speaking after the town hall, Tighe said she is still skeptical but said she is encouraged by the offer for a meeting and the chance to work together for fired workers.
“I would love for him to talk more about how he’s trying to fold in Republicans who might care about public health,” she said. “I’m not hearing anybody talk about that and I would love to see kind of how that’s working or at least giving us the opportunity to come and help him develop talking points to bring more people into the fold because this is going to have to be a big tent.”
Georgia Republicans have been largely indifferent to the CDC cuts publicly. After the first round in February, Gov. Brian Kemp, who is another potential Senate challenger, said “government can stand a little right-sizing.” Suwanee Republican U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick said he asked the White House to slow the pace of the firings after being caught in the crosshairs of an angry town hall, telling the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in February that “I think we’re just moving a little too fast.”
Sarah Boim, a former communication specialist with the CDC, also welcomed the chance for a meeting.
“I’m shocked that he has not been standing up more because we drive a lot of the economic activity where we live and we’re generally blue voters so he should be listening to us,” she said.

Kate Denny, a mom from Avondale Estates, expressed frustration at what she characterized as a lack of opposition in opposing Trump.
“You keep saying that there isn’t a magic button, and I recognize that you’re a senator and not in the House, and everything that Trump is doing is leading us down (the path to) authoritative rule. Why are there no calls for impeachment?” she said.
“Do you think that there’s nothing more that can be done? No! Do something more. I like you, and I will vote for you if you are brave and you do what we need,” she added.
Ossoff said he understands the frustration and that he believes Trump’s conduct “has already exceeded any prior standard for impeachment by the United States House of Representatives.”
“I also have no choice but to be candid with you about the situation that we face and the tools that are at our disposal, as strongly as I agree with you,” he added. “And I regret if this is an unwelcome response, but my job is to be honest with you. The only way to achieve what you want to achieve is to have a majority of the United States House of Representatives. Believe me, I’m working on it every single day, every single day.”
Responding to the exchange on X, the National Republican Senatorial Committee called Ossoff’s comments “disgusting.”
“Of course, Senator Jon @ossoff wants to overturn the will of Georgia voters who just elected President Trump.”
Trump, who narrowly lost Georgia in 2020, defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in Georgia last year by about 115,000 votes, winning with about 50.7% of the vote in a politically divided state.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-25 20:17:37+00:00,CT Mirror,"ICE is reversing termination of legal status for international students around US, lawyers say",Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/25/ice-student-visa-reverse-course/,"The decision comes after many court challenges were filed against the Trump administration crackdown, government lawyers said Friday.","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The federal government is reversing the termination of legal status for international students around the U.S. after many filed court challenges against the Trump administration crackdown, government lawyers said Friday.
The records in a federal student database maintained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had been terminated in recent weeks, often without the students or their schools being notified. Judges around the country had already issued orders temporarily restoring the students’ records in dozens of lawsuits challenging the terminations.
More than 1,200 students nationwide suddenly lost their legal status or had visas revoked, leaving them at risk for deportation. Many said they had only minor infractions on their record or did not know why they were targeted. Some left the country while others have gone into hiding or stopped going to class.
Government says it will restore student status
In one of the lawsuits, Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Kurlan read a statement in federal court in Oakland, California, that said ICE was restoring the student status for people whose records were terminated in recent weeks. A similar statement was read by a government attorney in a separate case in Washington, said lawyer Brian Green, who represents the plaintiff in that case. Green provided The Associated Press with a copy of the statement that the government lawyer emailed to him.
It says: “ICE is developing a policy that will provide a framework for SEVIS record terminations. Until such a policy is issued, the SEVIS records for plaintiff(s) in this case (and other similarly situated plaintiffs) will remain Active or shall be re-activated if not currently active and ICE will not modify the record solely based on the NCIC finding that resulted in the recent SEVIS record termination.”
SEVIS is the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems database that tracks international students’ compliance with their visa status. NCIC is the National Crime Information Center, which is maintained by the FBI.
Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant Homeland Security secretary, said ICE had not reversed course on any visa revocations but did “restore SEVIS access for people who had not had their visa revoked.”
Greg Chen, with the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said some uncertainty remained: “It is still unclear whether ICE will restore status to everyone it has targeted and whether the State Department will help students whose visas were wrongly revoked.”
Legal fights may not be over
Green, who is involved in lawsuits on behalf of several dozen students, said his cases only sought restoration of the student status and that he would be withdrawing them as a result of the statement Friday from ICE.
But lawyers in the Oakland case are seeking a nationwide order from the court prohibiting the government from arresting or incarcerating students, transferring them to places outside their district or preventing them from continuing work or studies.
Pam Johann, a government lawyer, said it was premature to consider anything like that given that ICE was in the process of reactivating student status records and developing a policy. “We should take a pause while ICE is implementing this change that plaintiffs are seeking right now, on its own,” she said.
But U.S. District Judge Jeffrey S. White asked her to humor the court and clarify ICE’s statement.
“It seems like with this administration there’s a new world order every single day,” he said. “It’s like whack-a-mole.”
Visa revocations and student status terminations caused confusion
Last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said his department was revoking visas held by visitors who were acting counter to national interests, including some who protested Israel’s war in Gaza and those who face criminal charges. But many students whose status was terminated said they did not fall under those categories.
A survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs research found that that even the visa revocations for students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests are not popular. About half of U.S. adults oppose this policy, and only 3 in 10 are in support. Among college educated adults, 6 in 10 strongly oppose, compared with 4 in 10 who aren’t college graduates.
In lawsuits in several states, students argued they were denied due process. Many were told that their status was terminated as a result of a criminal records check or that their visa had been revoked.
International students and their schools were caught off guard by the terminations of the students’ records. Many of the terminations were discovered when school officials were doing routine checks of the international student database.
Jodie Ferise, a higher education attorney in Indiana, said some students at schools her law firm works with already left the country after receiving instructions to self-deport.
“This unprecedented treatment of student status had caused tremendous fear among international students,” Ferise said. “Some of them were too frightened to wait and hope for the administration to change course.”
Earlier this week, before the government’s reversal, Ferise said the situation could hurt international student enrollment.
“The world is watching, and we will lose students, not just by the technical revocation of their status, but by the message we’re sending that we don’t want them anyway and that it isn’t safe to even try to go to school here,” she said.
At least 1,220 students at 187 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements, correspondence with school officials and court records. The AP has been working to confirm reports of hundreds more students who are caught up in the crackdown.

Patrick Morrisey speaks in Morgantown, W.Va., during the signage of Senate Bill 196 on Thursday, April 24, 2025. (West Virginia Office of the Gov. Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Thursday signed into law a bill to drastically increase criminal penalties for dealing and transporting certain types of drugs in West Virginia.
Senate Bill 196 — dubbed Lauren’s Law in honor of a Morgantown woman who died in 2020 after accidentally overdosing on drugs laced with fentanyl — passed the Legislature during the last days of the 2025 regular session.
The bill introduces mandatory minimum sentences into state code for transporting cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and fentanyl into West Virginia and removes alternative sentencing options — like probation or home confinement — for those who are jailed on those charges.
It also increases sentences against those charged with manufacturing, delivering or possessing with the intent to deliver a Schedule I or II narcotic or meth from one to five years up to three to 15 years. 
Anyone who is charged with those crimes who has more than five grams of fentanyl, among other quantities of other drugs, could face 10 to 30 years in jail.
The law uses weight requirements that can make someone delivering a drug containing any fentanyl to be charged with conspiracy. It also includes language for the crime of delivering a drug that results in someone’s death, with increased penalties for failing to render aid to someone who is overdosing.
During the bill signing on Thursday, Morrisey said he believes the law will be crucial to enhancing enforcement against drug crimes and deterring drug dealers from operating in the state.
“In West Virginia, we all know we’ve had a long and arduous history fighting substance abuse. It goes back many, many decades, and it’s ripped through our communities like a vengeance. It’s destroyed many lives. It’s laid waste to generations of West Virginia,” Morrisey said. “Lauren’s Law, we think, can be instrumental in helping our state deal with the drug epidemic. It’s part of the enforcement side of the equation, and it takes direct aim at the drug dealers.”
But advocates for people who use drugs and people in recovery worry that the law will do more harm than good. 
Oftentimes, people who use drugs are also dealing them as a way to pay for their addictions. And it’s not uncommon for individuals to be unaware that the drugs they are using or dealing contain fentanyl, advocates told West Virginia Watch upon the passage of SB 192 in the Legislature.
This bill, the advocates say, could open up low-level dealers to heightened penalties that will make it even more difficult for them to get help for their disease.
There is no data that shows stronger drug penalties anywhere curbing overdose or fatality rates related to the drug epidemic.
Instead of seeing higher criminal penalties that could have unintended consequences for people with substance use disorder, those in recovery and addiction spheres would like to see the state focus more on public health investments that are proven to lessen the impact of addiction on communities.
But SB 196 was only one of a handful of bills that was passed by the Legislature this session concerning drugs or addiction. And none of the bills that did pass related to public health initiatives, treatment for addiction or support for people with substance use disorder.
“The answer [to the opioid epidemic] is in public health investment. The last few years, we’ve seen our state — thanks to COVID federal funding — make additional investments in public health resources, in getting opioid reversal drugs into the hands of people who are using and people who care about them, and we’ve seen the fruits of that,” Sara Whitaker, the senior criminal legal policy analyst at the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, told West Virginia Watch earlier this month. “SB 196 has none of that, and it’s not going to change anything for the better.”

(Photo via Getty Images; DIAL logo courtesy of Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing)State, city and county inspectors have cited Iowa restaurants and stores for hundreds of food-safety violations during the past four weeks, including serious offenses related to rodents, rotten vegetables and other issues.
The findings are reported by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which handles food-establishment inspections at the state level. Listed below are some of the more serious findings that stem from inspections at Iowa restaurants, stores, schools, hospitals and other businesses over the past four weeks. (It appears that DIAL has not updated its online food-inspection database since April 17, so this story does not include any inspections that took place after that date.)
The inspections department reminds the public that their reports are a “snapshot” in time, and violations are often corrected on the spot before the inspector leaves the establishment. For a more complete list of all inspections, along with additional details on each of the inspections listed below, visit the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing’s website.

Pizza Hut, 1616 N. 2nd St., Clinton — During an April 4 visit, a state inspector cited the establishment for handwashing violations, a lack of sanitizing solution for the dishwasher, and for multiple products — including sausage, chicken, cheese and ham — that were stored in a cooler despite being labeled “keep frozen.” Also, wire shelving in the kitchen was soiled with grease, food debris, and dust, as were the kitchen walls and the exterior surfaces of some kitchen equipment.
The inspector also noted a “dark, gummy residue on the floor in the walk-in cooler, and a similar dark residue on the floor in the walk-in freezer.” The inspection was in response to “multiple non-illness complaints” pertaining to facility cleanliness, employee hygiene, food temperatures, lack of date-marking, and staff supervision. The complaints were deemed verified, the inspector reported.
La Casa Maya 2, 101 SE 2nd St., State Center — During an April 17 visit, a state inspector observed a worker handling raw meat and then handling ready-to-eat food without disposing of their soiled gloves or washing their hands between the two tasks. In the refrigerated food-preparation table in the kitchen, sliced lettuce was being held at 47 degrees, sliced tomatoes at 47 degrees and pico de gallo at 46 degrees — too warm to ensure their safety.
Inside a walk-in cooler, the inspector found cooked chicken and cooked pork carnitas that were not marked with a preparation date or a discard date. In addition, there was red salsa and queso cheese dip that had been prepared April 9, eight days prior to the inspection, which had to be discarded. Also, the handwashing sink in the kitchen was unable to produce hot water and there was no hand soap available.
The inspector also reported that cooked birria, cooked ground beef and cooked pork carnitas were being cooled in “full, deep pans” inside a walk-in cooler, slowing the cooling process and creating potential risks, and fish was being thawed while still inside vacuum-sealed packaging, creating a risk that any spoilage would go undetected. In addition, the inspector reported there were sticky traps for flying insects hanging over the food preparation area in the kitchen, and multiple pans of cooked beans and a large pot of cooked birria were being stored on the floor of the walk-in cooler.
Red Ginger, 1301 S. Gilbert St., Iowa City — During an April 17 visit, a Johnson County inspector observed that two food employees didn’t wash their hands before donning gloves and handling food. Also, all of the containers of raw seafood and vacuum-sealed fish in the sushi section’s coolers were storing food above the maximum temperature of 41 degrees. Because the person in charge stated the food had been there less than four hours, the items were relocated to the restaurant’s main refrigeration unit to ensure they were chilled to a safe holding temperature.
In addition, one refrigerator contained raw chicken and raw shrimp that was being held at 45 to 57 degrees. Because the person in charge stated the items had been there less than three hours, they were relocated to the main refrigerator for cooling. The inspector also noted that several containers of prepared foods in the walk-in cooler had no date markings to ensure freshness and safety.
In addition, the dishwasher was not reaching 165 degrees and was in need of repairs; the handwashing sink could not produce hot water; the sanitizing solution used in the sushi section was too highly concentrated, making it too strong for safe use; fish was being thawed while still in vacuum-sealed packaging, creating a risk that any spoilage would go undetected; and all of the coolers used in the sushi section were unable to maintain a temperature of 41 degrees or below.
Also, the shelving units inside the walk-in cooler had an “excessive buildup of dust, debris and rust” on their surfaces, and there was a buildup of food and debris on the floors of the walk-in freezer.
St. Kilda Collective, 333 5th St., West Des Moines — During an April 15 visit, a state inspector observed a food-service employee eating while washing items and another worker handling ready-to-eat toast with their bare hands. Also, raw chicken was being stored above raw salmon inside a cooler, risking cross-contamination, and cooked sausage links were being held at 75 degrees, which was not hot enough to ensure safe consumption. In addition, a slicer used two days before the inspection remained visibly soiled, and both handwashing stations in the kitchen had no hand soap available and no single-use towels for hand drying.
Beaver Tap, 4050 Urbandale Ave., Des Moines — During an April 15 visit, a state inspector cited the restaurant for 12 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number, and determined that not all of the employees designated as “the person in charge” were certified food protection managers as required, and that the person in charge at the time of the inspection was not fulfilling their duties as evidenced by the number and type of violations cited.
The inspector reported finding “prepared wings” that were left out and which measured 93 degrees, which was not hot enough to ensure safe consumption. Inside a walk-in cooler, the inspector found wings that were measured at 73 degrees and 89 degrees, and rice that was measured at 93 degrees and 44 degrees. The inspector also found Raid insecticide that was not approved for use in a food-service establishment, and food items, such as ground meat and pasta, that were cooling at room temperature inside deep, covered containers, which slowed the cooling process.
The inspector also reported food debris and a buildup of grease on the floors, under equipment, on storage shelving and on the walk-in cooler’s floor and shelves. The visit was in response to a non-illness complaint that was deemed verified, although the inspector’s report does not describe the nature of the complaint.
JW’s Pub and Grub, 58 SW Miller Ave., Cedar Rapids — During an April 11 visit, a Linn County inspector cited this establishment for eight risk-factor violations. The inspector noted that an employee was observed handling warmed breadsticks with her bare hands, and that biscuits dated April 4 were expired and had to be discarded. Also, macaroni and cheese had been heated in a microwave to 57 degrees rather than 165 degrees or hotter, utensils were being “stored in a container of water,” and there was no sanitizing solution prepared at the time of the inspection.










Heavy presence of mice and mouse droppings in the establishment ... Mouse-like droppings present on floors, cabinets, and racks.


– Scott County food-safety inspector commenting on Golden Mart in Davenport


Golden Mart, 1026 W. River Drive, Davenport — During a March 31 visit, a Scott County inspector observed “bags of chips” that were chewed open by mice and found that prepared salads were being “stored with raw chicken in the walk-in cooler.” Also, potatoes were being stored on the floor of the kitchen, and corn dogs and burritos that were stored in a hot-holding display unit were measured at 115 to 120 degrees — too cool to ensure they were safe to eat. The food was discarded with the inspector noting that the hot-holding unit may need to be replaced.
The inspector also noted that the potato cutter, the freezers in the kitchen, the Slushie machine, the fountain-drink machine, the racks inside the walk-in coolers, and the coffee machines were each marred by “debris and gunk.” Also, chicken livers were left out to thaw at room temperature, and racks and cabinets in the retail sales area were marred by debris and rodent droppings.
“Heavy presence of mice and mouse droppings in the establishment,” the inspector reported. “Mouse-like droppings present on floors, cabinets, and racks.”
The visit was in response to a complaint related to cross-contamination of food items and and general sanitation. The complaint was deemed verified.
Bickford Cottage, 101 New Castle Road, Marshalltown — During an April 11 visit to this assisted living center, a state inspector cited the facility for 10 risk-factor violations and noted the center had no certified food protection manager on staff. The inspector observed that a jar of jelly used for a recent meal was not sourced from an approved vendor and was canned at home by an employee.
Also, an open package of ham was stored inside the same container as raw ground pork, risking cross-contamination, and raw fish fillets were cooked to a temperature of only 115 degrees until the inspector intervened and instructed the staff to continue cooking the fillets. Also, there was no detectable level of sanitizer in the sanitizing solution that was being used, and the interior of the ice machine had a buildup “of red/brown” material on the dispenser.
Also, the food thermometers that were on hand appeared to be inaccurate, with one of the devices showing a deviation of 30 degrees when compared to a calibrated food thermometer. The inspector also noted that a large pork roast was stored in an opened package with the meat uncovered and exposed, risking contamination, and that the interior of a residential style refrigerator was marred by a buildup of food debris and spills. The facility’s kitchen last underwent a food-safety inspection in September 2023, according to state records.
The Buffalo Tavern, 2016 S. Main St., Burlington — During an April 10 visit, a Lee County inspector cited this establishment for holding cheesy potatoes, gravy, and cheese sauce at 115 degrees, which was not hot enough to ensure safe consumption. Also, the inspector reported, there was a “waitress prep cooler temping at 60 degrees with ranch and other sauces” — an apparent reference to a cooler that wasn’t keeping sauces at 41 degrees or colder.
In addition, several food items — including coleslaw, potatoes and sauces — had to be discarded as they had no date-markings to indicate when they were prepared or would expire. The establishment also discarded a pan of cooked hamburger that was not date-marked, and a container of homemade “special sauce” that was dated Feb. 23, six weeks prior the inspection.
In addition, the tavern’s mechanical dishwasher was not dispensing enough sanitizing solution, a food slicer in the kitchen was visibly soiled with a buildup of food, and the reach-in freezer, reach-in prep cooler, walk-in cooler and microwave oven were each marred by a buildup of food and debris. The inspector said there were issues with “general facility sanitation throughout the kitchen” and noted that the kitchen walls were visibly soiled with a buildup of some kind.
Fas Mart, 2175 Central Ave., Dubuque — During an April 9 visit, a city inspector noted the store was unable to provide documentation of any workers being currently certified as food protection managers. The inspector reported that an open retail-display cooler was holding packages of hot dogs at 47 degrees, sliced cheese at 44 degrees, a chicken salad sandwich at 47 degrees, and butter at 47 degrees. All of the items were discarded.
The inspector also found “multiple sandwiches, wraps and pre-made burritos” that had sell-by dates of April 2 and April 7, and which had to be discarded. In addition, the hot water in the handwashing sinks of both restrooms reached only 75 degrees, and there was no temperature-measuring device in the cooler that held food items for the store’s roller grill.
Swagat Indian Restaurant, 1108 Locust St., Dubuque — During an April 9 visit, a city inspector found yogurt made two days prior to the inspection in three separate five-gallon pails that had yet to cool to 41 degrees or colder and had to be discarded.
Also, the inspector reported finding multiple cooked foods — including yogurt, chicken, a spinach dish, and chickpeas — that were prepared more than 24 hours previously but which lacked any date-markings to ensure freshness and safety. All of the items were discarded. The inspector also determined the restaurant was producing homemade yogurt without the required variance or regulatory approval. In addition, the restaurant had not posted its most recent inspection report for customers to read.
Joensy’s Restaurant, 2563 N. Dodge St., Iowa City — During an April 8 visit, a Johnson County inspector noted the establishment did not employ a certified food protection manager as required. Also, “rotten and moldy tomatoes were observed stored in the walk-in cooler,” and raw eggs were being stored above ready-to-eat food inside the cooler, risking cross-contamination.
The inspector also noted that “multiple containers of food” within the walk-in cooler were left uncovered, creating a risk of contamination, and several containers of prepared foods and sauces lacked any date-markings to ensure freshness and safety. Debris was observed on a can opener, a food slicer, and two sets of tongs, although none of the equipment had been used that day.
Several containers of food were being stored on the floor of the walk-in cooler and tongs were stored on a soiled rag between uses. The inspector also noted a buildup of debris on the walls and floor. The establishment’s most recent previous routine inspection was in February 2021, although there were several complaint-driven inspections or follow-up visits since that time.










Very little date-marking was being done in the facility. Most date-marks appeared to have been put on as the inspection occurred.


– Linn County inspector commenting on Oyama Sushi Japanese Steakhouse in Cedar Rapids


Oyama Sushi Japanese Steakhouse, 5350 NE Council St., Cedar Rapids — During an April 8 visit, a Linn County inspector cited this establishment for 11 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. The inspector reported seeing employees handling raw meat and seafood with gloved hands, then handling ready-to-eat food without first washing their hands. In addition, several different species of raw food products were stored in the same containers, risking cross-contamination, and several coolers had containers of food that were left uncovered.
Also, the sushi preparation area did not have separate equipment for handling the raw and cooked products, and single-use gloves were seen being washed in a sanitizer bucket and then reused. In addition, cooked rice was being held at 44 to 49 degrees and had to be discarded. “Very little date-marking was being done in the facility,” the inspector reported. “Most date-marks appeared to have been put on as the inspection occurred.”
The inspector also noted that access to the kitchen’s handwashing sink was blocked by empty kegs and sacks intended for to-go orders were being used to store raw meat.
“Line coolers and line equipment were soiled on the insides and outsides,” the inspector reported. The visit was in response to an illness complaint which the inspector concluded was not verified.
A Taste of China, 30 Pearl St., Council Bluffs — During a March 24 visit, a state inspector found that the restaurant had no date-marking system in place to ensure that any of its food was safe and fresh. In addition, precooked chicken and eggs rolls were being held at room temperature and were not marked with the time at which they needed to be discarded. The inspection was in response to two illness complaints received by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing. The complaints were deemed to be unverified.

,Mississippi Today,2025-04-25 20:07:51+00:00,Mississippi Today,"With domestic violence law, victims ‘will be a number with a purpose,’ mother says",Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/04/25/with-domestic-violence-law-victims-will-be-a-number-with-a-purpose-mother-says/,A new state law calls for establishing a board to study domestic violence deaths and how to prevent them.,"Joslin Napier. Carlos Collins. Bailey Mae Reed. 
They are among Mississippi domestic violence homicide victims whose family members carried their photos as the governor signed a bill that will establish a board to study such deaths and how to prevent them. 
Tara Gandy, who lost her daughter Napier in Waynesboro in 2022, said it’s a moment she plans to tell her 5-year-old grandson about when he is old enough. Napier’s presence, in spirit, at the bill signing can be another way for her grandson to feel proud of his mother. 
“(The board) will allow for my daughter and those who have already lost their lives to domestic violence … to no longer be just a number,” Gandy said. “They will be a number with a purpose.” 
Family members at the April 15 private bill signing included Ashla Hudson, whose son Collins, died last year in Jackson. Grandparents Mary and Charles Reed and brother Colby Kernell attended the event in honor of Bailey Mae Reed, who died in Oxford in 2023. 
Joining them were staff and board members from the Mississippi Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the statewide group that supports shelters and advocated for the passage of Senate Bill 2886 to form a Domestic Violence Facility Review Board. 
The law will go into effect July 1, and the coalition hopes to partner with elected officials who will make recommendations for members to serve on the board. The coalition wants to see appointees who have frontline experience with domestic violence survivors, said Luis Montgomery, public policy specialist for the coalition. 
A spokesperson from Gov. Tate Reeves’ office did not respond to a request for comment Friday.
Establishment of the board would make Mississippi the 45th state to review domestic violence fatalities. 
Montgomery has worked on passing a review board bill since December 2023. After an unsuccessful effort in 2024, the coalition worked to build support and educate people about the need for such a board. 
In the recent legislative session, there were House and Senate versions of the bill that unanimously passed their respective chambers. Authors of the bills are from both political parties. 
The review board is tasked with reviewing a variety of documents to learn about the lead up and circumstances in which people died in domestic violence-related fatalities, near fatalities and suicides – records that can include police records, court documents, medical records and more. 
From each review, trends will emerge and that information can be used for the board to make recommendations to lawmakers about how to prevent domestic violence deaths. 
“This is coming at a really great time because we can really get proactive,” Montgomery said. 
Without a board and data collection, advocates say it is difficult to know how many people have died or been injured in domestic-violence related incidents.
A Mississippi Today analysis found at least 300 people, including victims, abusers and collateral victims, died from domestic violence between 2020 and 2024. That analysis came from reviewing local news stories, the Gun Violence Archive, the National Gun Violence Memorial, law enforcement reports and court documents. 
Some recent cases the board could review are the deaths of Collins, Napier and Reed. 
In court records, prosecutors wrote that Napier, 24, faced increased violence after ending a relationship with Chance Fabian Jones. She took action, including purchasing a firearm and filing for a protective order against Jones.
Jones’s trial is set for May 12 in Wayne County. His indictment for capital murder came on the first anniversary of her death, according to court records. 
Collins, 25, worked as a nurse and was from Yazoo City. His ex-boyfriend Marcus Johnson has been indicted for capital murder and shooting into Collins’ apartment. Family members say Collins had filed several restraining orders against Johnson. 
Johnson was denied bond and remains in jail. His trial is scheduled for July 28 in Hinds County.  
He was a Jackson police officer for eight months in 2013. Johnson was separated from the department pending disciplinary action leading up to immediate termination, but he resigned before he was fired, Jackson police confirmed to local media. 
Reed, 21, was born and raised in Michigan and moved to Water Valley to live with her grandparents and help care for her cousin, according to her obituary. 
Kylan Jacques Phillips was charged with first degree murder for beating Reed, according to court records. In February, the court ordered him to undergo a mental evaluation to determine if he is competent to stand trial, according to court documents. 
At the bill signing, Gandy said it was bittersweet and an honor to meet the families of other domestic violence homicide victims.

The panel, comprised of all George W. Bush-appointed judges, ordered state officials last week to, again, craft a new Senate map for the area in the suburbs of Memphis. The has held that none of the state’s prior maps gave Black voters a realistic chance to elect candidates of their choice. 
The latest map proposed by the all-Republican State Board of Election Commissioners tweaked only four Senate districts in northwest Mississippi and does not pit any incumbent senators against each other. 
The state’s proposal would keep the Senate districts currently held by Sen. Michael McLendon, a Republican from Hernando and Sen. Kevin Blackwell, a Republican from Southaven, in majority-white districts. 
But it makes Sen. David Parker’s district a slightly majority-Black district. Parker, a white Republican from Olive Branch, would run in a district with a 50.1% black voting-age population, according to court documents. 
The proposal also maintains the district held by Sen. Reginald Jackson, a Democrat from Marks, as a majority-Black district, although it reduces the Black voting age population from 61% to 53%.  
Gov. Tate Reeves, Secretary of State Michael Watson, and Attorney General Lynn Fitch comprise the State Board of Election Commissioners. Reeves and Watson voted to approve the plan. But Watson, according to meeting documents, expressed a wish that the state had more time to consider different proposals. 
Fitch did not attend the meeting, but Deputy Attorney General Whitney Lipscomb attended in her place. Lipscomb voted against the map, although it is unclear why. Fitch’s office declined to comment on why she voted against the map because it involves pending litigation. 
The reason for redrawing the districts is that the state chapter of the NAACP and Black voters in the state sued Mississippi officials for drawing legislative districts in a way that dilutes Black voting power. 
The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, are likely to object to the state’s newest proposal, and they have until April 29 to file an objection with the court
The plaintiffs have put forward two alternative proposals for the area in the event the judges rule against the state’s plans. 
The first option would place McLendon and Blackwell in the same district, and the other would place McLendon and Jackson in the same district. 
It is unclear when the panel of judges will issue a ruling on the state’s plan, but they will not issue a ruling until the plaintiffs file their remaining court documents next week. 
While the November election is roughly six months away, changing legislative districts across counties and precincts is technical work, and local election officials need time to prepare for the races. 
The judges have not yet ruled on the full elections calendar, but U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Leslie Southwick said at a hearing earlier this month that the panel was committed have the elections in November.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/01184715/Voting-15.jpg,,,2025-04-25 16:07:03.792823

Photo by Gordon Miller/News & BridgeThis story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on April 24.Lamoille Health Partners took quick action to avoid the eviction of its dental offices in Morrisville Plaza earlier this month, catching up on payments in arrears just as its landlord filed documents accusing the health care nonprofit of breaching its lease contract.Savoy-Texas, LLC, the Delaware-incorporated group that owns the building occupied by Lamoille Family Dentistry, alleged in court filings that Lamoille Health Partners owed $50,000 in lease payments.Peter Anderson, chair of the Lamoille Health board of directors, said the organization had caught up on lease payments just prior to the legal filing and that it was being withdrawn.Lamoille Health Partners is also facing a lawsuit filed by its former Stowe landlords after it withdrew its primary care clinic earlier this year. The legal claim filed by Grandview Farms alleges it is owed $240,000 in back rent and an unpaid share of common-area maintenance of the building.Susan Bartlett, Lamoille Health board member and interim CEO, said the organization’s failure to make its lease payments on the Morrisville dentistry was due to a lack of cash on hand, but the situation was stabilizing.Bartlett said the goal now is to make more efficient use of the space at the dentistry office and consolidate some of its services there. Lamoille Health Partners, a federally qualified health center that provides primary care, pediatric care, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and dental care to around 19,000 people, is currently undergoing an organization-wide, $2 million cost-cutting effort and exploring a merger with Copley Hospital.The dentistry, one of the few in the Lamoille County area that accepts adult patients with Medicaid insurance, has a months-long waitlist for new patient appointments.Lamoille Health’s federally qualified status allows it to be reimbursed by Medicaid at a higher rate than other health care providers and allows patients to pay for services on a sliding scale, but its already dire financial situation is further challenged by massive cuts to Medicaid being considered at the federal level by the Republican-controlled Congress.Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, R-Glover, raised the alarm regarding the potentially devastating health care cuts being considered at a recent Lamoille County legislative breakfast and again at a forum hosted by Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., in Stowe earlier this month, calling out specifically the threat posed to the state’s 11 federally qualified health centers.Bartlett, who served as Lamoille County’s state senator for decades, said she didn’t envy current lawmakers and called the threatened cuts “truly terrifying.”“It’s the chaos of not knowing,” she said. “Once you know, you can start to make some concrete plans and start to make what will be difficult choices, but it’s so hard to do any of that when you don’t know what’s going to happen.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Morristown dental clinic avoids eviction.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/waterville-elementary-1.jpg?fit=750%2C554&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-25 16:07:03.792823

(Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Washington House Democrats late Thursday approved a multibillion-dollar transportation revenue package anchored by a 6-cent increase to the state’s gas tax, the first hike in nearly a decade.
The increase would bring the state’s per-gallon gas tax from 49.4 cents to 55.4 cents, then raise it by 2% each year to account for inflation. 
At the same time, the state tax on diesel would go up three cents in July and another three cents two years later. That six cents would also get a 2% boost each year after that.
The gas tax hike, which would go into effect in July, is expected to raise $1.4 billion over the next six years. The diesel tax would net upward of $160 million over that time, estimates show. In total, lawmakers are banking on the package to bring in $3.2 billion over the next six years. 
Senate Bill 5801 contains numerous other tax and fee boosts. 
There’s an increase in the passenger vehicle weight fee. There’s a bump in the added sales tax for vehicles from 0.3% to 0.5%. There are $3 increases in the fees for titles and registrations. There’s a new 8% tax on the portion of the selling price of vehicles above $100,000. There’s a 10% tax on the amount of non-commercial aircraft sales above $500,000. There’s a temporary increase in the rental car tax from 5.9% to 11.9% before moving down to 9.9% in 2027.
There’s an increase in the tire replacement fee from $1 to $5. There’s a $1 increase every three years in fees for new IDs and driver’s licenses. And there’s an added charge for ferry riders paying with credit cards, as well as a 50-cent increase to the capital vessel surcharge on each fare.
House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, said the “dire” transportation budget situation warrants the potpourri of taxes. 
Lawmakers have warned of a $1 billion shortfall over the next two-year budget cycle, ballooning to $8 billion over the next six years. They point to skyrocketing construction costs, flagging gas tax revenue and the looming multibillion-dollar question of how to address the court-ordered removal of culverts blocking fish migration.
“My constituents don’t want to pay more, but they want to drive on roads that are well maintained,” said Rep. Julia Reed, D-Seattle. “They want to ride on ferries that function and run on time. They want to see their streets served by modes of transportation that allow them to get out of their cars once in a while, and allow their children to move around more freely.”
Republicans say the medley of taxes, on top of separate levies to pay for the operating budget, is too much for working-class residents to bear. 
Rep. Andrew Barkis, the leading Republican voice in the House on transportation issues, said in floor debate that he recognizes revenue is needed to improve Washington’s infrastructure.
But “it comes to a point where we’re putting this on the backs of Washingtonians with an ever-increasing burden of taxation,” said Barkis, of Olympia.
On the House floor, Democrats rejected Republican proposals to get rid of the increases to the gas and diesel taxes, rental car tax, vehicle sales tax and tire replacement fee.
Democrats did choose to ax a controversial $1-per-attendee tax on sporting events, concerts and more at large venues. To make up for the lost revenue, they added another increase to the fee on heavier passenger vehicles.
They also elected to require the state Department of Transportation to conduct an analysis before imposing tolls across the entire State Route 520 corridor, not just the floating bridge, as is currently the case. 
When the Senate approved its initial $3 billion revenue framework last month, four Republicans joined most Democrats in support. On Thursday night, the new version in the House passed 51-47 without any Republican votes and eight Democrats in opposition.
Senate Bill 5801 now goes to the Senate to agree with the changes made in the House before sending it to Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson’s desk by Sunday’s scheduled close of the legislative session. The chamber plans to take it up later Friday.
Ferguson has not publicly weighed in on the proposed gas tax increase.
“We’ll see when that comes to me,” Ferguson told reporters Friday, noting he was expecting a briefing from his budget director on the plan’s latest version.
How exactly the additional money will be spent remains to be seen. Lawmakers finished negotiating late Wednesday on their funding plan, expected to total upward of $15 billion. They plan to release their agreed proposal Saturday morning. 
Also on Thursday, the House approved transferring 0.1% of proceeds from the state sales tax from the operating budget to transportation starting in the 2027-29 biennium. This would shift hundreds of millions of dollars toward transportation.
The Senate on Friday also passed the bill, Senate Bill 5802, so it’s headed to the governor.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Interstate-5-Traffic-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-25 16:07:03.792823

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)FBI agents arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on Friday, accusing her of obstructing an immigration enforcement action last week.
Dugan was arrested at 8:30 a.m. at the county courthouse, according to the U.S. Marshal’s Service. She was scheduled to make an initial appearance in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries at 10:30 on Friday. According to a criminal complaint, she’s been charged with obstructing or impeding before a department or agency of the United States and concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest.
Online court records show that the government did not request that Dugan be held in detention and that she was released on an O/R bond, meaning she was released from custody without having to post bail and signed an agreement that she’d appear in court when required.
The agency’s director, Kash Patel, wrote on the social media platform X that Dugan had “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. In the now-deleted post, Patel accused Dugan of creating “increased danger to the public.”
Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 for a pre-trial conference on charges of misdemeanor domestic battery. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents appeared outside Dugan’s courtroom, she led Flores-Ruiz and an attorney out a side door and down a private hallway.
ICE agents later apprehended Flores-Ruiz on foot. This is the third time since March that immigration agents have appeared at the Milwaukee County courthouse to conduct arrests — a tactic that local officials have said threatens to undermine the work of the local justice system by making immigrants fearful of coming to the courthouse to testify in court.
Dugan-Crim-complaint
In an initial statement, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said he was aware of Dugan’s arrest and that the legal process should be allowed to play out.
“Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process,” Crowley said. “We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.”
But later, he accused the FBI of politicizing the arrest to punish perceived enemies.
“It is clear that the FBI is politicizing this situation to make an example of her and others across the country who oppose their attack on the judicial system and our nation’s immigration laws,” he said. “FBI Director Kash Patel issued a public statement on X, which he hurriedly deleted, making unsubstantiated claims about Judge Dugan’s case before charges were officially filed and she could have her moment in court. Director Patel’s statement shows that Trump’s FBI is more concerned about weaponizing federal law enforcement, punishing people without due process, and intimidating anyone who opposes those policies, than they are with seeking justice.”
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said the administration of President Donald Trump is attacking democratic values.
“In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons,” she said. “The President’s administration arresting a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move, and it threatens to breach those very separations of power. Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a Democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by. By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic Democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line. While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this President’s lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress’s checks on his power.”
Gov. Tony Evers said the arrest was another example of the Trump administration’s attacks on the judiciary.
“Unfortunately, we have seen in recent months the president and the Trump Administration repeatedly use dangerous rhetoric to attack and attempt to undermine our judiciary at every level, including flat-out disobeying the highest court in the land and threatening to impeach and remove judges who do not rule in their favor,” he said. “I have deep respect for the rule of law, our nation’s judiciary, the importance of judges making decisions impartially without fear or favor, and the efforts of law enforcement to hold people accountable if they commit a crime. I will continue to put my faith in our justice system as this situation plays out in the court of law.”
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) said the arrest was “shocking.”
“This Administration’s willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach,” Moore said. “Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require a high legal bar. I will be following this case closely and facts will come out, however, I am very alarmed at the increasingly lawless actions of the Trump Administration, and in particular ICE, who have been defying courts and acting with disregard for the Constitution.”
The ACLU of Wisconsin wrote on social media that ICE making arrests at courthouses interferes with the work of local justice officials.
“Judges have a duty to maintain order in their courtrooms and ensure the fair administration of justice, and federal law does not require state judges to act as agents of federal immigration enforcement,” the organization said. “Everyone is due their day in court, and when ICE starts showing up to courts looking to make arrests, it risks interfering with those rights. In recent weeks, the administration has attacked the integrity of our judicial system, refused to comply with a Supreme Court order, and arrested a judge for using her authority to protect the fair administration of justice.”

Senate Bill 50 requires cities and towns to change their election dates by in 2032. Morrisey signed the bill into law on Friday.
Supporters of the bill say requiring municipalities to have their elections along with state elections will save cities and towns money on election costs and lead to higher voter turnout. 
According to the West Virginia Secretary of State’s Office, 113 municipalities across the state will have their elections in 2025, which is not a year for state elections. 
Both bodies of the Legislature overwhelmingly supported the measure. Different versions of  the bill passed 96 to 2 in the House and unanimously in the Senate. Lawmakers ultimately approved the Senate’s version of the bill, which sets a deadline of 2032 for the cities to change their election days. The House’s version would have set the deadline at 2028.

The news release did not provide details, and MUS spokesperson Galen Hollenbaugh could not be immediately reached Friday for additional information.
UM President Seth Bodnar said he was disappointed Marrongelle would not be at the helm of the Butte campus with some 2,500 students. Montana Tech is connected to UM.
“Dr. Marrongelle is an exceptional and talented leader and would have been an outstanding chancellor for Montana Tech,” Bodnar said in a statement. “While we are disappointed that she won’t be joining the MT Tech community, we wish her every success.”
Marrongelle could not be immediately reached Friday through a message left with her office.

Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.

“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Trump wants states to handle disasters without FEMA. They say they can’t.

Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Get rid of FEMA? Trump-appointed group to look at shifting disaster response to states.

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)North Dakota is poised to be the first state in the nation to implement a law that provides legal protections for pesticide manufacturers — an issue that has been debated in legislatures across the country in the face of large payouts to cancer victims.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Wednesday signed House Bill 1318 that specifies that a label approved by the Environmental Protection Agency acts as sufficient warning to users about the hazards posed by pesticides and herbicides such as Roundup.
Georgia’s General Assembly passed its version of the pesticide protection bill but it has yet to be signed. The National Agricultural Law Center has been tracking the status of similar legislation in Iowa, Florida, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wyoming.
Elizabeth Burns-Thompson is the executive director of the Modern Ag Alliance, a national group backing the legislation in North Dakota and other states.
“This law sets the standard for states across America to pass legislation similar to HB 1318 and, ultimately, stand up for our farmers,” Burns-Thompson said Thursday in a statement.
Ag groups have lined up behind the pesticide legislation, saying it ensures farmers will have access to chemicals they need to control weeds and insects.
Critics have said the bill will make it harder for people harmed by chemicals to win lawsuits against the manufacturers of chemicals.
 

Germany-based Bayer, maker of the popular herbicide Roundup, has been ordered to pay out billions of dollars to plaintiffs who claim the product has caused cancer.
The EPA has never determined that Roundup causes cancer. Plaintiffs have still prevailed, in part on the argument that they were not adequately warned.
Brigit Rollins, attorney for the National Agricultural Law Center, wrote earlier this year that almost every pesticide injury lawsuit filed in the past 10 years has included a claim that the pesticide manufacturer failed to warn the plaintiff of the health risks associated with the product.
Rollins was unavailable for comment Thursday, but wrote earlier this month that it was not clear how pesticide laws might affect pending lawsuits, which number in the thousands nationally.
Bayer’s website says it is also hopeful for a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of laws such as the one being implemented in North Dakota.
A Bayer executive said in an April 14 Wall Street Journal article that the company may have to shut down U.S. production of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup.
The pesticide bill in North Dakota sailed through the House of Representatives, where it was introduced, passing unanimously in January. 
It faced more debate in the Senate, but was amended and returned to the House. A small group of protesters gathered outside the Capitol the day of the Senate vote, urging members to reject the bill.
Its second vote in the House was much closer, passing 51-40.
As the debate on the bill wrapping up, Rep. Donna Henderson, R-Calvin, said, “If we have learned anything, it is that we don’t know all the answers. We don’t know what this bill does.”
She noted that similar legislation has been pushed in other states.
“If it’s just a simple labeling bill, why did 35 other states vote it down?” she asked.
Leaders of North Dakota farm groups expressed their appreciation for the bill Thursday.
“This monumental step forward helps ensure our farmers have the certainty they need to make long-term planning decisions and stay productive in the field,” Justin Sherlock, president of the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association said.
While the debate focused on Roundup, the law applies to other pesticides registered with the state Department of Agriculture.
The North Dakota law will take effect July 1. If signed, the Georgia law would take effect Jan. 1, 2026.
Armstrong’s office declined to comment on his decision to sign the bill.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM) A dispute over sewage disposal in a village outside of Santa Fe is leaking into the New Mexico Supreme Court, as residents contend state environmental agency actions surrounding a draft waste permit were unconstitutional.
Dozens of people gathered at blue cafeteria tables and the bleachers lining the Tesuque Elementary School gymnasium Wednesday night to hear the latest in the ongoing fracas over a permit for a leach field to dispose of treated wastewater from Bishop’s Lodge hotel and 82 adjacent homes in Tesuque Village.
Democratic Santa Fe elected officials also attended the town hall, including County Commissioner Justin Green in the room, and Rep. Andrea Romero and Sen. Peter Wirth virtually.
Tensions in the case have been building for the last year, as residents oppose multiple proposals for sewage disposal by the resort.
The meeting followed the latest development in the case: On April 22, attorneys for the nonprofit Protect Tesuque requested the state’s highest court order the New Mexico Environment Department to halt the permitting process for the hotel and homes, arguing in an emergency petition that the agency wrongly applied state environmental laws in the permitting process.
Specifically, they say the limitations in liquid waste laws should also apply to larger permits — dischargers disposing more than 5,000 gallons, which are regulated under another law.
State environmental regulators disagree.
“The New Mexico Environment Department maintains full confidence in its legal position that the Bishop’s Lodge wastewater treatment system falls under ground and surface water quality regulations,” said NMED spokesperson Jorge Estrada in a written statement. “NMED has consistently affirmed that the facility meets — or exceeds — all applicable state water quality standards.”
An administrative hearing officer on April 7 rejected Protect Tesuque’s request for the department to deny the permit.
Protect Tesuque’s argument to the state Supreme Court is that NMED’s permitting process for large dischargers ignores the regulations passed by the Legislature, and the agency doesn’t have the legal authority to make exceptions to those laws.
“NMED is making their own laws,” Hnakso told Source. “Their whole basis for doing what they’re doing is only applying the law if you’re discharging less than 5,000 gallons per day. If it’s more, they apply a different law — but that’s not what the Environmental Improvement Act says.”
He called it a separation of powers issue.
“The plain language is that the executive branch has to apply the law as written by the legislature,” Hnasko said. “If they don’t, it’s a constitutional violation.”
On Wednesday, attorneys for both NMED and Bishops Lodge filed court documents requesting that justices either dismiss the case or issue a schedule with deadlines for responses.
Thomas Hnasko, an attorney representing the nonprofit Protect Tesuque, in comments at the town hall to the approximate 60 attendees, said he was unsure if the state’s highest court would hear the emergency petition, and noted that the arguments had to contend with years of agency permitting.

“It’s a heavy lift because that’s the way it’s always been done,” Hnasko said. “It’s really difficult when you’re taking a position that’s gonna upset the apple cart and not only affect Tesuque, but have an effect statewide.”
But lawmakers, Hnasko said, could clarify which laws guide NMED’s permitting decisions.
“If changes need to be made or variances need to be applied for, that can happen in the Legislature,” he said. “But right now, the Environmental Improvement Act does not allow what they’re doing.”
Background on the dispute
Tesuque Village, with a little over 1,000 residents, depends mostly on septic tanks for sewage, and private wells for drinking water.
When Bishop’s Lodge’s 1970s-era wastewater treatment plant stopped working, the resort began trucking wastewater into Santa Fe for treatment, which the owners described as expensive and inefficient.
“Bishop’s Lodge and the Hills & Villas Community have worked closely with the New Mexico Environment Department Groundwater Quality Bureau to replace their old wastewater treatment system,” Chris Kaplan, the head of Asset Management at Juniper Capital, which owns Bishop’s Lodge, said in a written statement. “The new system, installed in 2024, is a state-of-the-art wastewater treatment facility designed to meet or exceed all local and national water quality standards.”
The resort changed its plans in response to community pushback, he added. “The original plan to release the fully treated effluent to surface water was abandoned in favor of an on-site, low-dosing area that will capture the fully treated effluent in the winter months.”
The current state permit authorizes Bishop’s Lodge to discharge about 14,700 gallons per day into two leach fields on the property. The new request would allow for discharge of up to 30,000 gallons of treated wastewater into a new leach field.

Protect Tesuque opposes the new disposal plan, writing on its website that the proposal fails to meet “engineering, siting, and contamination safeguards required by our state laws,” and pushes potential impacts downstream.
Residents Wednesday night expressed concerns about the costs of well testing and the potential loss of home values and safety if contamination occurred in the aquifer.
“I don’t want to have to spend $3,000 every year having my well tested test just to have somebody tell me they  screwed up my water and I lost, you know, a considerable value in the house and I won’t be able to sell,” resident Brian Corcoran said.
A week-long hearing on the draft permit is scheduled to start May 19.
‘You’re moving too slowly’
In Wednesday’s town hall, local officials suggested longer-term initiatives that could help address some of the issues at play.
For instance, Commissioner Green announced a plan to start engineering a regional water system that could move forward, after securing the final signature from the Pueblos of Tesque, Nambé, Pojuaque and San Ildefonso earlier that day. He said work on the study should begin in the next few months.
“That said, these things don’t happen very quickly. This is a large capital project, this will take years and years and years to do a lot of this groundwork,” he said.
Wirth agreed that ultimately the long-term solution must be developing a regional water and sewage system.
Residents said the solution isn’t fast enough.
“I’m sorry. But you’re moving too slowly,” said Donna Amos, a resident who lives near Shidoni Gallery, garnering applause from other attendees. “We will all be dead by the time a regional water system is done.”
Both Wirth and Romero, after multiple requests from audience members, committed to meeting with Juniper Capital representatives, but hesitated on further actions, such as introducing legislation, both saying it would be important to see if the state’s Supreme Court will weigh in on the issue.
After the town hall, Bernadette Romero-Jaramillo, a physical therapist and member of Protect Tesuque, said she believes the situation is no longer just a local fight, but one with statewide implications if the court takes up the case.
“Ours is a community that is here to fight to the bitter end to protect our village, our resources — it’s about our future,” she said. “We need a resolution for the now.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) In the absence of a new contract, Butler Hospital’s unionized workers are gearing up for a possible strike, union officials announced Friday morning.
About 90% of the members of SEIU 1199NE, the union representing about 800 positions at the Providence psychiatric hospital, voted to OK the strike. 
Butler Hospital frontline caregivers working without contract want more safety precautions

Because of vacancies in union roles, there are 704 union members now working at Butler. Of those members, 643 voted, with only six voting against the strike. The vote began on Monday and ended Thursday evening.  
A date has not been set for a strike as of Friday. Union members include professional and clerical staff, registered nurses, mental health workers, and housekeeping and dietary staff. All four SEIU 1119 contracts with Butler expired on March 31. 
“We are dealing with record numbers of assaults in the hospital and too many of us are afraid just to go to work,” Dan Camp, who works in behavioral health call intake at Butler, said in a statement Friday. “For the last month we have put forward specific proposals to improve workplace safety and the quality and consistency of care for our patients but management refuses to take our concerns seriously.” 
The vote comes four days after hundreds of Butler workers paraded up and down Blackstone Boulevard to protest wages and working conditions at the hospital, where SEIU 1199NE says the rate of assaults on workers increased 41% from 2022 through 2024.
“Low wages are the key reason staffing is so short and turnover is so high,” Camp continued. “We have Butler staff who are struggling to feed their family and even living out of their cars —- when people are worried about their basic needs it reduces the quality of the care and support we can provide.”
There were 108 open union positions at the hospital as of Friday. In the most recent contract, which expired March 31, mental health workers started at $18.27 an hour. Hourly wages for housekeeping and dietary staff started at $16.08, clerical workers started at $19.76, and professional staff and registered nurses started at $32.50 an hour. 
Raina C. Smith, a spokesperson for Butler’s parent company Care New England, responded to the news via email Friday afternoon.
“It is very disappointing that 1199SEIU asks its members to vote on a potential strike,” Smith wrote. “This is unnecessary and distracting, given that we are currently in active negotiations with a session planned for next week.” 
“Butler Hospital’s team is focused on reaching an agreement at the table, and we hope the union can focus its attention on the same goal,” Smith continued.
The hospital and the union will next meet at the bargaining table on Wednesday, April 29.

,Mississippi Today,2025-04-25 19:25:33+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Governor vetoes certificate of need reform bill, cites ongoing litigation over Jackson psychiatric hospital",Gwen Dilworth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/04/25/governor-vetoes-certificate-of-need-reform-bill-cites-ongoing-litigation-over-jackson-psychiatric-hospital/,A Senate amendment to the bill would have granted a new certificate of need to Oceans Behavioral Hospital Jackson and put to bed a legal dispute with Merit Health Central over the amount of charity care the hospital must provide.,"Gov. Tate Reeves vetoed the legislature’s certificate of need reform bill Thursday, arguing it unlawfully attempted to circumvent an ongoing court case by granting a certificate to a single psychiatric hospital in Jackson. 
The state’s law, which requires medical facilities to apply for a “certificate of need” from the Mississippi State Department of Health before opening or adding new services, aims to lower costs and increase the accessibility and quality of health care by avoiding duplication of services. 
A Senate amendment to the bill would have granted a new certificate of need to Oceans Behavioral Hospital Jackson and put to bed a legal dispute with Merit Health Central over the amount of charity care the hospital must provide. 
For-profit, Texas-based Oceans reopened St. Dominic’s Health’s shuttered mental health unit last year. 
Merit Health, which also operates a psychiatric unit in Jackson, sued Oceans last March, arguing it violated the law by using a workaround to skirt a health department requirement that it provide more free or low-cost care than it planned to in its application for a certificate of need. In the lawsuit, attorneys for Merit argued that Oceans not providing a sufficient level of charity care would have a “significant adverse effect” on Merit by diverting more low-income patients to its beds. 
“The proposed amendment smacks of both imprudent legislative favoritism towards the entity that will receive the CON, as well as bald prejudice to the other market participants,” Gov. Reeves wrote in his veto message. “In either case, awarding a CON by legislative fiat is bad public policy.”
Most of the bill was focused on making it easier for medical facilities to make capital improvements and require the University of Mississippi Medical Center seek state approval before opening educational facilities outside of Jackson. The final version of the bill also mandated that the health department study uncompensated care rates in psychiatric hospitals, such as the beds at the center of the Oceans lawsuit.
The governor said he would sign the bill if the carve-out for Oceans was removed.
In a statement to Mississippi Today, Oceans CEO Stuart Archer said his company remains committed to providing behavioral health care in the state.
“Oceans is fulfilling that commitment to the residents of Jackson and communities across Mississippi, and we will continue to fight for our hospital’s ability to provide care,” he said.
Rep. Sam Creekmore, R-New Albany and chair of the Public Health and Human Services committee and author of the House’s proposal, told Mississippi Today he was disappointed but not surprised by the governor’s veto. While he did not disapprove of the provision granting a certificate of need to Oceans, he suspected it might draw scrutiny from the governor. 
He said he has asked the governor to include certificate of need reform as a topic in his call for a special session to pass a bill this year.
“I think it’s very important for our rural hospitals especially to get this done now,” he said. 
The legal battle over care at the psychiatric unit housed at St. Dominic’s Health has now been ongoing for over a year. 
The state health department, which is tasked with overseeing the certificate of need process, recommended approval of Oceans’ application in December 2023, but said the hospital would have to provide 17% free or low-cost medical care to low-income individuals – more than the two percent it proposed in its application. 
But rather than adhere to the state’s stipulation for charity care, Oceans and St. Dominic’s filed for a change of ownership, bypassing the state’s requirement altogether and instead qualifying to open under St. Dominic’s existing certificate of need. 
Merit Health then sued Oceans, arguing that the change of ownership violated the state’s certificate of need law. St. Dominic’s and the State Department of Health are codefendants in the case. 
Earlier this month, a Hinds Chancery court judge ruled that Oceans’ change of ownership was legal, but that the health department exceeded its authority by not undergoing certificate of need review and ruled that the agency must complete the review within 120 days.
The health department appealed the case to the Supreme Court in March, requesting a stay. The court has yet to rule on the appeal. 
Sen. Hob Bryan, D-Amory, chairman of Public Health and Welfare, introduced the Oceans-related amendment and said it, along with the requirement that UMMC seek state approval before opening educational facilities outside of Jackson, sought to develop and improve upon medical services in the capital city. 
On the Senate Floor, he also said it aimed to put an end to the legal battle. 
“There’s a lawsuit pending trying to say that the transfer was improper,” he said March 12. “The transfer was proper. What we hope to do with this is moot the lawsuit.”
A spokesperson for Merit Health said charity care provisions should be equitable to ensure hospitals can treat people with the greatest health needs. 
“We will continue to support changes to CON regulations that improve access to healthcare and reduce barriers to healthcare delivery for all providers,” she said.  
St. Dominic’s and the state health department declined to comment on the ongoing litigation. 
Certificate of need legislation shapeshifted over the course of the session. During the process, the Senate removed several key provisions of the bill originally approved by the House of Representatives, including those that would have streamlined the law’s appeals process and freed certain in-demand health care services – including substance use treatment and outpatient hospital dialysis units – from being required to acquire a “certificate of need” from the state to open.

Larry Rhoden announced Friday he’s seeking nominations for a new lawmaker to represent District 22 in eastern South Dakota after he appointed Sen. David Wheeler, R-Huron, to serve as a judge in the state’s Third Circuit.
District 22 includes Beadle, Spink and part of Clark counties. Wheeler was serving his third term as a state senator after he was first elected in 2020. He served as chair of the Senate Commerce and Energy Committee this session and vice chair of the Government Operations and Audit Committee and the State Affairs Committee. He was also a member of the Judiciary and Legislative Procedure committees.
Wheeler will replace retiring Judge Greg Stoltenburg. The Third Circuit consists of the counties of Beadle, Brookings, Clark, Codington, Deuel, Grant, Hamlin, Hand, Jerauld, Kingsbury, Lake, Miner, Moody and Sanborn.
“As a judge, it will be my job to apply the law fairly and equally,” Wheeler said in a news release, “without regard for politics or personal beliefs.”
Rhoden said he believes Wheeler will “represent the judicial branch with the same integrity, work ethic, and passion that he did in the Senate.”
Wheeler earned his bachelor’s, master’s and law degrees from the University of South Dakota before returning to his hometown of Huron. He is married with three children and a partner at the Blue, Wheeler and Banks law firm.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)FBI agents arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on Friday, accusing her of obstructing an immigration enforcement action last week.
Dugan was arrested at 8:30 a.m. at the county courthouse, according to the U.S. Marshal’s Service. She was scheduled to make an initial appearance in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries at 10:30 on Friday. According to a criminal complaint, she’s been charged with obstructing or impeding before a department or agency of the United States and concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest.
Online court records show that the government did not request that Dugan be held in detention and that she was released on an O/R bond, meaning she was released from custody without having to post bail and signed an agreement that she’d appear in court when required.
The agency’s director, Kash Patel, wrote on the social media platform X that Dugan had “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. In the now-deleted post, Patel accused Dugan of creating “increased danger to the public.”
Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 for a pre-trial conference on charges of misdemeanor domestic battery. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents appeared outside Dugan’s courtroom, she led Flores-Ruiz and an attorney out a side door and down a private hallway.
ICE agents later apprehended Flores-Ruiz on foot. This is the third time since March that immigration agents have appeared at the Milwaukee County courthouse to conduct arrests — a tactic that local officials have said threatens to undermine the work of the local justice system by making immigrants fearful of coming to the courthouse to testify in court.
In an initial statement, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said he was aware of Dugan’s arrest and that the legal process should be allowed to play out.
“Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process,” Crowley said. “We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.”
But later, he accused the FBI of politicizing the arrest to punish perceived enemies.
“It is clear that the FBI is politicizing this situation to make an example of her and others across the country who oppose their attack on the judicial system and our nation’s immigration laws,” he said. “FBI Director Kash Patel issued a public statement on X, which he hurriedly deleted, making unsubstantiated claims about Judge Dugan’s case before charges were officially filed and she could have her moment in court. Director Patel’s statement shows that Trump’s FBI is more concerned about weaponizing federal law enforcement, punishing people without due process, and intimidating anyone who opposes those policies, than they are with seeking justice.”
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said the administration of President Donald Trump is attacking democratic values.
“In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons,” she said. “The President’s administration arresting a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move, and it threatens to breach those very separations of power. Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a Democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by. By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic Democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line. While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this President’s lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress’s checks on his power.”
Gov. Tony Evers said the arrest was another example of the Trump administration’s attacks on the judiciary.
“Unfortunately, we have seen in recent months the president and the Trump Administration repeatedly use dangerous rhetoric to attack and attempt to undermine our judiciary at every level, including flat-out disobeying the highest court in the land and threatening to impeach and remove judges who do not rule in their favor,” he said. “I have deep respect for the rule of law, our nation’s judiciary, the importance of judges making decisions impartially without fear or favor, and the efforts of law enforcement to hold people accountable if they commit a crime. I will continue to put my faith in our justice system as this situation plays out in the court of law.”
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) said the arrest was “shocking.”
“This Administration’s willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach,” Moore said. “Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require a high legal bar. I will be following this case closely and facts will come out, however, I am very alarmed at the increasingly lawless actions of the Trump Administration, and in particular ICE, who have been defying courts and acting with disregard for the Constitution.”
The ACLU of Wisconsin wrote on social media that ICE making arrests at courthouses interferes with the work of local justice officials.
“Judges have a duty to maintain order in their courtrooms and ensure the fair administration of justice, and federal law does not require state judges to act as agents of federal immigration enforcement,” the organization said. “Everyone is due their day in court, and when ICE starts showing up to courts looking to make arrests, it risks interfering with those rights. In recent weeks, the administration has attacked the integrity of our judicial system, refused to comply with a Supreme Court order, and arrested a judge for using her authority to protect the fair administration of justice.”

“Even with Hasbro’s relative strength and flexibility, logistics are becoming more complex and changes in receivables and shipping dynamics present a challenge,” Cocks said. “Ultimately, tariffs translate into higher consumer prices, potential job losses as we adjust to absorb increased costs, and reduced profits for our shareholders.”
There were no specifics shared on layoffs or price hikes.
Hasbro has accelerated a shift away from manufacturing in China — where 50% of its toys are made now — and intends to reduce its reliance on Chinese materials and labor to less than 40% of toys by 2026, Gina Goetter, Hasbro chief operating and financial officer, told investors during the call.
Other cost-cutting measures on the horizon include “source optimization” and “targeted pricing actions.” Together with potential layoffs and “prioritizing debt reduction,” Goetter estimated the company would see a net profit loss of $60 million to $180 million this year, mostly reflected in the second half of the year. The estimates are based on an existing 145% U.S. tariff on Chinese goods and a 10% tariff on goods from other countries.
No mention was made of Hasbro’s potential relocation to Massachusetts during the earnings call nor in the financial report. But costs associated with swapping its circa 1900 headquarters on Newport Avenue in Pawtucket for a piece of prime Boston-area real estate could be off the table as uncertainty roils the stock and bond markets.
Earlier this month, as Hasbro’s stocks plunged to a 52-week low, company executives postponed the headquarters announcement. Originally expected within the first three months of the year, Hasbro now expects to provide “clarity” on potential moving plans in the summer, Andrea Snyder, a company spokesperson, said previously.
Gov. Dan McKee’s office did not respond to inquiries for comment Friday, but said earlier this month the administration will “remain engaged” with Hasbro. The publicly traded international company first opened as a family-owned pencil box maker in Providence, and still employs roughly 1,000 workers in Rhode Island.
The economic roller coaster set off by Trump’s trade policies has not yet hit home for Hasbro, though. The company saw profits rise 17% compared with a year ago, boosted by a 46% increase in its digital gaming business, featuring Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons products.
Its digital gaming segment has been shielded from tariffs because its products are made in the U.S., or are digital, executives said.
The company has also not revised its guidance to investors on its annual performance.
“While we are dealing with a wide range of potential tariff, retailer and consumer outcomes, our games business and our strategic flexibility give us options,” Goetter told investors on the call.
Earnings per diluted share rose to 70 cents per share, up from 42 cents a year ago. Hasbro also saw stocks rebound slightly in the last 30 days. Shares opened at $61.84 Friday morning.

(Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA — As the Catawba Nation tries to double its police force, a bill adding the Native American tribe’s dedicated officers to the state police retirement system could help, officials for the tribe have said.
The bill, which passed the Senate unanimously but is awaiting a hearing in the House, would allow members of the police department to receive monthly pension payments after their retirement, based on their salary and years of service. All cities and counties in the state are allowed to opt into the system.
The Catawba Nation, which established its police department in 2023, has struggled to hire officers in large part because nearby law enforcement agencies, such as the York County Sheriff’s Department, offer better benefits, said Sen. Michael Johnson, the bill’s sponsor.
“They’re just simply asking to be allowed to join in so they can attract and, most importantly, retain law enforcement,” Johnson, R-Tega Cay, told a panel of senators.
Ideally, the department would have between 12 and 15 police officers, said Shawn Butler, head of public safety and chief of police for the tribe. The tribe hired its sixth officer earlier this month, but he still needs to go through training before he can officially start policing the reservation’s 4,200 people.
Allowing the Catawba Nation’s officers to join the state retirement system “is not only a matter of fairness but also a practical step toward strengthening law enforcement and public safety statewide,” Butler said in a statement.
A proposed casino in Santee won’t pass this year. But GOP-led bill shows new support for gambling.

“Ensuring equitable benefits for (Catawba Nation Tribal Police Department) officers will enhance recruitment, retention, morale, and inter-agency collaboration — all of which are essential for building safer and stronger communities,” Butler said.
In the past, the York County Sheriff’s Department handled any issues on the reservation. The state’s only federally recognized tribe still has an agreement with the sheriff’s department to help out as needed, though the goal is to become independent, said the tribe’s lobbyist, Jason Puhlasky.
If allowed to join the retirement system, Catawba Nation officers would contribute nearly 10% of their total pay, the same as every other police officer firefighter, and magistrate who participates. The retirement system allows retirees to start receiving benefits after working for 27 years or turning 55, so long as they meet the program’s requirements.
Because the nation’s police force is so small, the impact on the retirement system will be minimal, according to a fiscal analysis of the bill.
“It would be like any other small town joining,” said Justin Werner, an attorney for the Public Employee Benefit Authority, which oversees retirement plans for the state.
Unlike other towns, cities and counties, the Catawba Nation would need legislative approval to join because of the tribe’s status as a sovereign nation.
Since 1993, the tribe has governed itself under an agreement with the state and federal governments. In joining the retirement system, the nation would have to follow the rules of the state retirement system or face enforcement actions.
Giving up any aspect of the tribe’s hard-won sovereignty is difficult, but tribe leaders felt it was worth the benefit of hiring more officers, Puhlasky said.
SC Native American tribes sign treaty promising to work together

The agreement is “a huge give, just so you know,” Puhlasky told legislators. “It comes with great trepidation.”
The same federal agreement that allowed the tribe to govern itself also gave it the power to create its own police department, though for years it lacked the resources. After the tribe’s Two Kings Casino opened in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, in 2021 — roughly 50 miles from the reservation — the revenue allowed the tribe to start hiring more officers.
Those officers, who work and live in South Carolina, won’t be involved with the casino over state lines, Puhlasky said. Security at the casino is handled through an agreement with the local sheriff’s department that allows the tribe to hire local deputies as security during their off-duty hours, he said.
As the police department grows, the tribe plans to build a permanent courtroom and police department, to be called the Catawba Nation Tribal Court and Peacemaking Center, on the reservation.
Early estimates put the cost of the roughly 12,000-square-foot building between $10 million and $12 million, Butler said. A Department of Justice grant will cover $1.6 million of that. But before the tribe can finish its own public safety center, it needs to know it can hire the officers to staff it, Puhlasky said.
“This is a big piece of how that would work,” Puhlasky said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-25-at-2.34.52-PM-1024x513.png,,,2025-04-25 15:22:56.444739

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Two vetoes by Gov. Kelly Armstrong stood up to challenges in the North Dakota Legislature on Friday. 
Armstrong vetoed Senate Bill 2307, a library obscenity bill, and House Bill 1540, that would have used taxpayer dollars to support private school tuition vouchers. 
A two-thirds majority was needed to override the vetoes.  
The library bill got fewer votes in the Senate on Friday than it had when the bill passed, despite the pleas of bill sponsor Sen. Keith Boehm, R-Mandan, and other supporters. 
Armstrong vetoed the private school funding but urged lawmakers to advance a broader school Education Savings Account bill. But that bill, Senate Bill 2400, failed in a House vote late Thursday. 
The tuition vouchers bill passed the House 49-43 on Monday. Friday’s attempt to override the veto in the House failed 48-45.
Lawmakers began the legislative session with five Education Savings Account bills, but none of the proposals remain under consideration.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)FBI agents arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on Friday, accusing her of obstructing an immigration enforcement action last week.
Dugan was arrested at 8:30 a.m. at the county courthouse, according to the U.S. Marshal’s Service. She was scheduled to make an initial appearance in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries at 10:30 on Friday. According to a criminal complaint, she’s been charged with obstructing or impeding before a department or agency of the United States and concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest.
Online court records show that the government did not request that Dugan be held in detention and that she was released on an O/R bond, meaning she was released from custody without having to post bail and signed an agreement that she’d appear in court when required.
The agency’s director, Kash Patel, wrote on the social media platform X that Dugan had “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. In the now-deleted post, Patel accused Dugan of creating “increased danger to the public.”
Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 for a pre-trial conference on charges of misdemeanor domestic battery. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents appeared outside Dugan’s courtroom, she led Flores-Ruiz and an attorney out a side door and down a private hallway.
ICE agents later apprehended Flores-Ruiz on foot. This is the third time since March that immigration agents have appeared at the Milwaukee County courthouse to conduct arrests — a tactic that local officials have said threatens to undermine the work of the local justice system by making immigrants fearful of coming to the courthouse to testify in court.
Dugan-Crim-complaint
In an initial statement, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said he was aware of Dugan’s arrest and that the legal process should be allowed to play out.
“Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process,” Crowley said. “We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.”
But later, he accused the FBI of politicizing the arrest to punish perceived enemies.
“It is clear that the FBI is politicizing this situation to make an example of her and others across the country who oppose their attack on the judicial system and our nation’s immigration laws,” he said. “FBI Director Kash Patel issued a public statement on X, which he hurriedly deleted, making unsubstantiated claims about Judge Dugan’s case before charges were officially filed and she could have her moment in court. Director Patel’s statement shows that Trump’s FBI is more concerned about weaponizing federal law enforcement, punishing people without due process, and intimidating anyone who opposes those policies, than they are with seeking justice.”
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said the administration of President Donald Trump is attacking democratic values.
“In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons,” she said. “The President’s administration arresting a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move, and it threatens to breach those very separations of power. Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a Democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by. By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic Democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line. While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this President’s lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress’s checks on his power.”

Gov. Tony Evers said the arrest was another example of the Trump administration’s attacks on the judiciary.
“Unfortunately, we have seen in recent months the president and the Trump Administration repeatedly use dangerous rhetoric to attack and attempt to undermine our judiciary at every level, including flat-out disobeying the highest court in the land and threatening to impeach and remove judges who do not rule in their favor,” he said. “I have deep respect for the rule of law, our nation’s judiciary, the importance of judges making decisions impartially without fear or favor, and the efforts of law enforcement to hold people accountable if they commit a crime. I will continue to put my faith in our justice system as this situation plays out in the court of law.”
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) said the arrest was “shocking.”
“This Administration’s willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach,” Moore said. “Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require a high legal bar. I will be following this case closely and facts will come out, however, I am very alarmed at the increasingly lawless actions of the Trump Administration, and in particular ICE, who have been defying courts and acting with disregard for the Constitution.”
The ACLU of Wisconsin wrote on social media that ICE making arrests at courthouses interferes with the work of local justice officials.
“Judges have a duty to maintain order in their courtrooms and ensure the fair administration of justice, and federal law does not require state judges to act as agents of federal immigration enforcement,” the organization said. “Everyone is due their day in court, and when ICE starts showing up to courts looking to make arrests, it risks interfering with those rights. In recent weeks, the administration has attacked the integrity of our judicial system, refused to comply with a Supreme Court order, and arrested a judge for using her authority to protect the fair administration of justice.”

Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton), lead sponsor of a bill package that would create a Prescription Drug Affordability Board, speaking in support of the original legislation in 2023. | Kyle DavidsonFor the second time, Michigan Senate Democrats have pushed forward legislation they say will bring to heel “skyrocketing” prescription drug costs in the state.
On Thursday, the state Senate passed bills that would create a Prescription Drug Affordability Board, or PDAB, which would have the authority to set upper payment limits on drugs sold in Michigan. 
“This board is a simple concept and a great idea,” Sen. Darrin Camilleri (D-Brownstown Township), sponsor of one of the bills, said. “It allows for a public body of officials appointed by the governor, including folks who have no connection to the pharmaceutical industry whatsoever, who would then review some of these exorbitant price increases that we see from some companies as they are attempting to gouge the American consumer. They will hold them accountable.  It will be a public and transparent process, and they will find ways to lower those costs for our residents.”
Republican opposition, however, centered on concerns of replacing a free market system with a “government-controlled collectivist system,” as Sen. Thomas Albert (R-Lowell) referred to it.

“Why do we have such a disproportionate amount of innovation and pharmaceuticals in the United States of America as opposed to the rest of the globe?” he asked. “It’s because the producers are free to innovate and they are free to have the market regulate the supply and the demand of the product. If you eliminate that, there’s no incentive for innovation or entrepreneurship.  It goes away. The competition is destroyed. This does not benefit people.  This hurts people.”
The package, consisting of Senate Bills 3, 4 and 5, passed with a bare majority of 20 votes, with Sen. John DaMoose (R-Harbor Springs) the lone Republican to join the 19 Democrats in approval. The legislation now moves to the GOP-controlled House, where its future is less assured.
This is the second time Democrats have passed the bills through the Senate, with the upper chamber previously approving the legislation in October 2023, only to see it ultimately die without a vote in the House Insurance and Financial Services Committee. At the time, the House was controlled by Democrats, but with Republicans now in the majority there, passage will be even more difficult. 
One ray of hope for supporters came from Damoose, who voted against the plan when it originally passed, but on Thursday said further investigation produced a change of heart on his part.
“Last term I was persuaded by the idea that the market should determine the cost of drugs,” Damoose said. “But the more I learned, the more apparent it became that calling the prescription drug market a free market is a total farce.  We are so far from being a free market when it comes to pharmaceuticals, it’s unbelievable.”
Damoose noted the hundreds of billions of dollars invested by the federal government in developing many of the most popular and useful drugs, and yet U.S. taxpayers in many cases did not have affordable access to those drugs. 
“It’s unconscionable in my mind that those within the nation that supported the development of production of the most incredible body of medical advancement the world has ever seen would pay more than anyone else to access the benefits of those very prescription drugs,” Damoose said. 
The pharmaceutical industry, however, sees the situation differently, with trade group PhRMA saying the proposed board would have “long-term, harmful effects” on both the development of livesaving drugs and patients’ ability to access them.  
“Prescription Drug Affordability Boards are a disaster for patients,” said Stami Turk, director of public affairs at PhRMA. “These bills put the government between patients and their doctors. Patients deserve access to the medicine their doctors prescribe – not roadblocks from Lansing. The House has the chance to do the right thing and to get the government out from in between patients and their physicians.”
Doctors, meanwhile, have welcomed the proposal, with support from the Michigan State Medical Society and the Committee to Protect Health Care. 
Dr. Rob Davidson, is an emergency room physician in west Michigan and executive director of the committee.
“Doctors are encouraged to see this legislation to help our patients better afford their prescription drugs, and to help finally hold Big Pharma accountable, move forward in the legislative process,” Davidson said. “We look forward to swift passage of these bills in both the Senate and House in Michigan so that our patients here can also benefit from upper payment limits and be able to take their medications as doctors like us prescribe.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_1359-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-25 15:22:56.444739

Lindsey Daugherty speaks during a bill signing at the Colorado Capitol on April 24, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Senate voted on Friday morning to override a veto on a bill that would require social media companies to remove users who sell drugs and firearms to young people.
If the House takes the same action, it would be the Legislature’s first successful veto override in decades.
“This bill gives us the tools to help remove predators and traffickers who use social media to harm our kids. This is not about censorship. It’s not about speech. It’s about standing up for the safety and dignity of our youngest and most vulnerable,” said Sen. Lindsey Daugherty, an Arvada Democrat who sponsored the bill.
The chamber voted 29-6 to override. It needs a two-thirds majority in both chambers to become law.
Senate Bill 25-86 would regulate social media companies by requiring they remove people from the platform who violate the terms of service by exploiting young people for sexual content or sell drugs or firearms. It would also set a stricter timeline for when companies would need to comply with a law enforcement request for materials and require annual data reports to the Legislature about illegal activity on platforms.
The bipartisan supporters of the bill say it is about protecting children who use social media from predators.
“If we let this veto stand, we are choosing to protect the business interests of billion-dollar tech companies over the safety of Colorado kids,” Daugherty said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But opponents, a group that spanned the political spectrum including left-leaning ProgressNow and the libertarian group Independence Institute, argued the bill could infringe on free speech and places too much power in the hands of social media companies to police their sites. Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, ultimately landed on that side as well.
“This law imposes sweeping requirements that social media platforms, rather than law enforcement, enforce state law. It mandates a private company to investigate and impose the government’s chosen penalty of permanently deplatforming a user even if the underlying complaint is malicious and unwarranted,” he wrote in his Thursday veto letter. “In our judicial proceedings, people receive due process when they are suspected of breaking the law. This bill, however, conscripts social media platforms to be judge and jury when users may have broken the law or even a company’s own content rules.”
His office did not immediately have a comment on the override vote, but pointed to the nine veto requests various organizations sent.
Democratic Sens. Julie Gonzales of Denver, Nick Hinrichsen of Pueblo, Janice Marchman of Loveland, Katie Wallace of Longmon, Faith Winter of Broomfield and Republican Sen. Mark Baisley of Woodland Park voted against the override.
Polis could also face a veto override vote over his rejection of Senate Bill 25-77, which would set a longer timeline for some open records requests from non-journalists. The Senate laid over that override vote until next Friday.

A Tumblr account bearing the same username Reid has used on other social media platforms included explicit photographs that had been reposted from other accounts. 
Reid confirmed that Youngkin called him and denied that he’d posted the sexually explicit content. 
“As long as I have been in the public space, I have been a target for malicious and salacious lies,” Reid told The Richmonder. “This is the second overt attempt to try to force me from the race.”
When Fairfax County supervisor Pat Herrity dropped out for health reasons, Reid became the party’s candidate for lieutenant governor. Reid, a conservative radio host, is Virginia’s first openly gay candidate from either party for statewide office.
Herrity bows out of LG race, setting Virginia’s GOP ticket for 2025

His campaign also falls at a time where the state legislature is advancing three Democrat-led constitutional amendments — one of which would remove a defunct 2006 prohibition on same-sex marriage from Virginia’s constitution. Most Republicans in the House (where all seats are up for election this year) and the state Senate either voted against the measure or abstained from voting. 
The Mercury reached out to Reid for further comment Friday afternoon, but he did not respond by the time of this publication. 
Should he decide to drop out, the Republican Party of Virginia’s state central committee would select a new candidate, Republican sources said. 
With both parties hosting primaries for various positions on June 17, early voting is set to begin on May 2. Herrity’s exit had made the Republican executive ticket uncontested within its own party — Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is running for governor, Attorney General Jason Miyares is pursuing reelection and Reid was set to be Earle-Sears’ successor in their challenge against Democrats for those roles later this year.

“The Governor was made aware late Thursday of the disturbing online content. Friday morning, in a call with Mr. Reid, the Governor asked him to step down as the Lt. Governor nominee,” a spokesperson for Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC said in a statement.
“I can tell you that’s not my account and anyone on the internet can open accounts with the same or similar names as other people,” Reid countered in the video. He went on to deny ever publicly performing or sharing anything pornographic. 
“Have I seen porn? Yes. Have I had one night stands? Yes. Are my exes all still in love with me? No,” Reid said. “What more can I possibly tell you, and why am I the candidate who has to answer questions on this topic? Let’s be honest: It’s because I’m openly gay and I have never bowed down to the establishment and I will not.”
While he has come to expect “harassment and vulgar attacks” from “radical” Republicans and “angry leftists” for his identity as an openly gay Republican man, Reid said, “what I didn’t expect was the governor I have always supported to call and demand my resignation without even showing me the supposed evidence or offering me a chance to respond.  I did not accept that and I deeply resent it.”

With both parties hosting primaries for various positions on June 17, early voting is set to begin on May 2. Herrity’s exit had made the Republican executive ticket uncontested within its own party — Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is running for governor, Attorney General Jason Miyares is pursuing reelection and Reid was set to be Earle-Sears’ successor in their challenge against Democrats for those roles later this year.

Coach Lindy Callahan, who in his 97 years on this planet touched and influenced more lives than could ever by calculated, passed away quietly Wednesday at his home in Gulfport.
In his adopted hometown and far beyond, Callahan was a giant in high school athletics.
Born on Christmas Day, 1927, in Vicksburg, Lindy Gene Thomas Callahan turned out to be a gift to Mississippi sports: an athlete, a coach and finally an administrator who dedicated his professional life to improving the lives of young people.

Rick Cleveland
“Lindy showed the rest of us how to do it,” is the way Mike Justice, a highly successful football coach soon to be inducted into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame, put it. “As a high school coach and athletic director, he was the best of the best.”
“Everything Lindy Callahan did in life, he did with the utmost class,” said Don Hinton, a former coach and executive director of the Mississippi High School Activities Association.
In 1963, Coach Callahan broke my 11-year-old heart. The undefeated Hattiesburg Tigers, my favorite team, played his undefeated Gulfport Commodores at Milner Stadium in Gulfport on what is now Lindy Callahan Field. When those 1963 HHS Tigers took the field, they really did look like the LSU Tigers, both size-wise and in school colors. More than a dozen of them went on to play Division I football, including Ed Morgan, a future Alabama Crimson Tide halfback and Hattiesburg mayor who scored an early touchdown to give the Tigers a 7-0 lead. Final score: Gulfport 33, Hattiesburg 7. Gulfport, a much smaller team in physical size and numbers, turned Hattiesburg every which way but loose. That was part of a 35-game Gulfport winning streak and another streak of 42 consecutive victories in the old Big Eight Conference. Over Callahan’s last six seasons as Gulfport football coach, his teams won 54 and lost five.
Lindy really was one of those coaches who, as the late Jake Gaither described, could take his’n and beat your’n or take your’n and beat his’n. As an administrator, he hired splendid coaches, including Hall of Famer Bert Jenkins, the remarkably successful Gulfport basketball coach, the best I ever covered at any level in any sport.
That’s why Callahan is a member of nine different halls of fame, five on a national level and four more on a regional level. Put it this way: Any hall of fame he’s eligible for, he is in. In 1995, the MHSAA instituted the Lindy Callahan Student-Athlete Awards, college scholarships that annually are presented to 16 deserving Mississippi high school seniors.

A much younger Lindy Callahan at his desk at Gulfport High School.
His legacy goes far beyond all that. Callahan spearheaded the creation of the Mississippi-Alabama High School All-Star Game. He created guidelines and policies that athletic directors around the state still use today. For 57 years, he and Coach Leo Jones directed the Gulf Coast Coaching Clinic,an invaluable resource for coaches across the Deep South. Said Justice, “If you wanted to learn how to coach, that’s where you went.”
Although Callahan was born in Vicksburg, the son of a railroad engineer, he grew up in Meridian. There, he lived  across the street from athletic fields that would shape his life. He was a football and baseball star, recruited to Ole Miss by football coach John Vaught and baseball coach Tom Swayze.  He played both sports collegiately and often credited Vaught and Swayze with teaching him the organizational and leadership skills he would use professionally.
Two years ago, a book tour took co-author Neil White to a stop in Gulfport where Callahan showed up along with many of his former players. The bond between the old coach and his former players, now with gray hair themselves, was unmistakeable, an absolute joy to witness. Although his legs were failing him, Lindy’s mind was as sharp as any 20-year-old. Every time a former player referred to him as “Coach,” his eyes brightened and his lips curled into a smile.
All who knew Callahan know that as dedicated as he was to his professional life, he took the most pride in his family. He and his wife of 71 years, the former Ann Fincher, were the parents of three, grandparents of five and great grandparents of 10, all of whom called Coach Callahan “Papa.”
Callahan often referred to himself as “Lucky,” as in “Lucky Lindy,” And his really was a storybook life, even near the end. The ambulance that carried him from hospital to home, where he wanted to live his final days, detoured by Milner Stadium and Lindy Callahan Field for one last glance at a place he dearly loved. As fate had it, the stadium gates were open and the ambulance circled the track – one last victory lap for a champion.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/25131456/Lindy-Callahan.-in-tux-2012.jpg,,,2025-04-25 15:22:56.444739

Lawrence McClure and Speaker Daniel Perez discuss the budget impasse at  a news conference April 24, 2025. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The House on Friday voted, 78-29, to pass a $5 billion tax relief package, with most of the opposition involving changes to the collection of tourist development dollars.
While it was a mostly partisan vote in support, the bill faces opposition from Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has pushed for the elimination of property taxes and a $1,000 homeowner rebate, and Senate President Ben Albritton who has rolled out a more modest tax relief package. 
Disagreement over the breadth of tax relief is a primary reason the Legislature is unlikely to pass a state budget within the 60-day legislative session, scheduled to end on May 2.
HB 7033 sponsor Rep. Wyman Duggan called the proposed tax reduction historic.
“It’s record breaking. It’s historic. It’s permanent. It’s immediate. Every citizen in the state will benefit from it,” he said.
Specifically, the bill would lower Florida’s state sales tax rate by 0.75%, to 5.25%. The bill would reduce all other sales tax rates by the same amount — commercial rent from 2% to 1.25%; electricity from 4.35% to 3.6%; new mobile home purchases from 3% to 2.25%; and coin-operated amusement machines from 4% to 3.25%.

Starving fiscally constrained counties?
Most of the criticism on the floor centered around the changes to the tourist development tax, known as the “hotel bed tax.” Florida law authorizes counties to levy five separate tourist development taxes for specified purposes, all of which are generally related to the tourism industry. 
These taxes cover a bevy of uses — financing stadiums; operating convention centers; funding tourism development councils; and promoting publicly owned zoological parks among them.
These are levied in 62 of the state’s 67 counties with total combined rates ranging from a low of 2% to a high of 6%, according to a legislative analysis of the bill.
HB 7033 redirects the use of  tourist development taxes away from tourism-related efforts to the county’s general revenue coffers instead. The bill directs the funds to be used to offset county property taxes beginning in 2026.
Rep. Allison Tant, who represents parts of Leon, Jefferson, and Madison counties, said the tax receipts are vital to those counties, none of which offer the beaches that beckon so many tourists to Florida. Rather, those counties rely on bed taxes to market the wonder of rural Florida — the “part of our state you don’t see in fancy brochures on the turnpike or inexpensive ads on TV.”
“Pulling tourism development tax dollars from this effort will not just further starve fiscally constrained counties, but also punish them for their self-sufficiency,” Tant said.










It's record breaking. It's historic. It's permanent. It's immediate. Every citizen in the state will benefit from it.


– Rep. Wyman Duggan


While he has support of his chamber, Perez’s ambitious $5 billion reduction doesn’t have the support of his counterpart, Senate President Albritton. The disagreement is a major reason the House and Senate couldn’t agree on the total dollar amount in spending for the state fiscal year 2025-26 and won’t pass a spending plan before the end of the 60-day session.
Albritton is on board with tax relief but he has floated a more modest $2.1 billion tax plan, centered around a permanent elimination of the sales tax on clothing and shoes costing $75 or less. Other parts of his plan include a permanent reduction in the business rent tax from 2% to 1%, a one-time credit for vehicle registration fees, and several sales tax holidays.
DeSantis opposes the House plan but not because of the price tag. The governor has proposed his own $5 billion cut starting with providing homeowners a $1,000 property tax rebate. From there, DeSantis wants to permanently eliminate property taxes, which would take voter approval and couldn’t be done before November 2026.

Mike Kehoe generated a lawsuit Friday challenging its constitutionality even as Attorney General Andrew Bailey wasted no time using new powers granted in the law.
The bill changes the deadlines and procedure for challenging the ballot language of measures placed before voters by the General Assembly or by initiative petition. It also allows the ballot summaries to be longer. 
 But a major focus of legislative debate was the provision of the bill giving the attorney general the power to appeal preliminary injunctions granted in cases where the state or a statewide official is blocked from enforcing a law or statute.
It was inspired by an ongoing abortion-rights lawsuit and included an emergency clause making the power to appeal preliminary injunctions effective immediately. The bill cited the need “to ensure judicial efficiency” as the reason it is “deemed necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health, welfare, peace and safety” of the state.
Missouri lawmakers approve bill targeting pending abortion lawsuit

On Friday, attorney Chuck Hatfield filed a lawsuit in Cole County Circuit Court on behalf of longtime progressive activist Sean Nicholson arguing the bill violates the constitution in six ways. The emergency clause, and the reason it gives for invoking the Constitution’s provision for making laws effective immediately, are not an emergency, Hatfield wrote.
“There is no crisis or emergency which requires immediate or quick legislative action for the preservation of the public peace, property, health, safety, or morals,” Hatfield wrote.
Bailey followed through on the intent of the legislation Thursday by using the newly granted power to challenge two preliminary injunctions issued after voters approved Amendment 3 overturning Missouri’s near-total ban on abortions. 
The first preliminary injunction, issued by Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang in December, blocked state laws that required a 72-hour waiting period for an abortion and a mandate that physicians performing abortions have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.
The second, issued Feb. 14, stopped enforcement of a licensing requirement for abortion clinics that providers argued was a key obstacle to renewing access to the procedure across the state. Hours later, Planned Parenthood clinics announced they would begin offering abortion services in Missouri.
In a statement issued Thursday, the ACLU of Missouri and the state’s two Planned Parenthood affiliates vowed to fight against the effort to alter the laws governing court cases.
“A majority of Missouri voters passed Amendment 3 to end Missouri’s abortion ban and protect reproductive freedom,” the statement read. “Rather than following the will of the people, the same anti-abortion politicians that fought against Amendment 3 and lost at the ballot box have changed the rules of both the initiative petition and the court procedures so they can try to reinstate Missouri’s abortion ban.”
A spokeswoman for Bailey’s office said in an emailed statement that he filed an appeal to challenge the court’s decision to “eliminate common-sense health and safety standards.
Abortion Action Missouri executive director Mallory Schwarz said in a news release that the bill signed by Kehoe is an admission that abortion rights backers have won at the ballot box and in the courts. 
“The governor signing this attack on democracy just shows that the state is power hungry and obsessed with controlling Missourian’s lives, taking away their personal and private decision-making, and inserting itself into their bedrooms and doctors’ offices,” Scharz said.
Missouri clinics will ‘immediately’ offer abortion across the state after judge’s ruling

In the lawsuit, Hatfield wrote that until the passage of the bill signed Thursday, Missouri court procedure did not allow an appeal of preliminary injunctions. 
Hatfield wrote that “the grant of the right is one sided, favoring only the attorney general” and violates the state Constitution’s guarantee of equal rights and opportunity. 
The power to appeal past preliminary injunctions is also “unconstitutionally retroactive because it is applicable to preliminary injunctions in place prior to the passage.”
The Missouri Constitution forbids ex post facto laws — laws making something a crime after the act — and laws that alter contracts or is retrospective in effect.
The bill’s provisions governing the revision of ballot language is a reaction to the legal fight over the wording for Amendment 3. In 2023, Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem ruled the ballot title written by then-Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft was “argumentative” or unfairly biased and rewrote it. That decision was upheld by the Missouri Western District Court of Appeals.
Under the bill, a ballot title deemed insufficient or unfair would be sent back to the secretary of state for revision. The courts would have to allow three attempts, all under increasingly tight deadlines, before taking over the job.
The bill also moves up the deadline for completing all court challenges from eight weeks before the election to 10 weeks before the election.
Along with creating unconstitutional powers for the attorney general and granting them in an unconstitutional way, Hatfield’s lawsuit alleges the bill was improperly changed to alter its original purpose and that the changes made violate the constitutional requirement that bills address a single subject.
The bill filed by state Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican, began as “one new section relating to ballot summaries prepared by the general assembly.” It was changed to be “three new sections relating to ballot summaries” in a Senate committee before being passed as “five new sections relating to judicial proceedings.”
One provision allowing ballot titles to have 100 words instead of 50 has nothing to do with judicial proceedings, the lawsuit states. 
And the power to appeal preliminary injunctions has nothing to do with ballot summaries prepared by lawmakers, it adds.
No hearings can be set for the lawsuit until notice is served on Bailey and Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, the defendants in the case.
The political battle over abortion, and how the initiative process is used, is also continuing inside and outside the General Assembly.
On April 17, the Missouri House approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would overturn most provisions of Amendment 3, restoring the ban on abortions that was in place starting in 2022 but with new exceptions for medical emergencies, fatal fetal anomalies and for survivors of rape and incest in the first 12 weeks of gestation.
The bill has not been assigned to a state Senate committee.
Lawmakers have tried, and failed, to pass proposals that would change how many signatures must be gathered for initiatives and how majorities are counted for initiative measures that make the ballot.
A group called the Respect Missouri Voters Coalition has filed an initiative proposal to add new protections for initiative measures to the state constitution. Any initiative changing a statute or the constitution could only be altered by lawmakers if 80% of members in both chambers vote for a bill that is then submitted to a statewide vote.
The bill signed Thursday will give far too much power to the secretary of state, Benjamin Singer, co-founder of the Respect Missouri Voters Coalition and CEO of Show Me Integrity, said in a news release.
“Missouri’s citizen initiative process is now dead for anything that the Secretary of State doesn’t like and wants to kill with biased language,” Singer said.

FBI agents arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on Friday, accusing her of obstructing an immigration enforcement action last week.
Dugan was arrested at 8:30 a.m. at the county courthouse, according to the U.S. Marshal’s Service. She was scheduled to make an initial appearance in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries at 10:30 on Friday. According to a criminal complaint, she’s been charged with obstructing or impeding before a department or agency of the United States and concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest.
Online court records show that the government did not request that Dugan be held in detention and that she was released on an O/R bond, meaning she was released from custody without having to post bail and signed an agreement that she’d appear in court when required.
The agency’s director, Kash Patel, wrote on the social media platform X that Dugan had “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. In the now-deleted post, Patel accused Dugan of creating “increased danger to the public.”
Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 for a pre-trial conference on charges of misdemeanor domestic battery. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents appeared outside Dugan’s courtroom, she led Flores-Ruiz and an attorney out a side door and down a private hallway.
ICE agents later apprehended Flores-Ruiz on foot. This is the third time since March that immigration agents have appeared at the Milwaukee County courthouse to conduct arrests — a tactic that local officials have said threatens to undermine the work of the local justice system by making immigrants fearful of coming to the courthouse to testify in court.
In an initial statement, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said he was aware of Dugan’s arrest and that the legal process should be allowed to play out.
“Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process,” Crowley said. “We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.”
But later, he accused the FBI of politicizing the arrest to punish perceived enemies.
“It is clear that the FBI is politicizing this situation to make an example of her and others across the country who oppose their attack on the judicial system and our nation’s immigration laws,” he said. “FBI Director Kash Patel issued a public statement on X, which he hurriedly deleted, making unsubstantiated claims about Judge Dugan’s case before charges were officially filed and she could have her moment in court. Director Patel’s statement shows that Trump’s FBI is more concerned about weaponizing federal law enforcement, punishing people without due process, and intimidating anyone who opposes those policies, than they are with seeking justice.”
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said the administration of President Donald Trump is attacking democratic values.
“In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons,” she said. “The President’s administration arresting a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move, and it threatens to breach those very separations of power. Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a Democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by. By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic Democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line. While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this President’s lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress’s checks on his power.”
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) said the arrest was “shocking.”
“This Administration’s willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach,” Moore said. “Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require a high legal bar. I will be following this case closely and facts will come out, however, I am very alarmed at the increasingly lawless actions of the Trump Administration, and in particular ICE, who have been defying courts and acting with disregard for the Constitution.”
The ACLU of Wisconsin wrote on social media that ICE making arrests at courthouses interferes with the work of local justice officials.
“Judges have a duty to maintain order in their courtrooms and ensure the fair administration of justice, and federal law does not require state judges to act as agents of federal immigration enforcement,” the organization said. “Everyone is due their day in court, and when ICE starts showing up to courts looking to make arrests, it risks interfering with those rights. In recent weeks, the administration has attacked the integrity of our judicial system, refused to comply with a Supreme Court order, and arrested a judge for using her authority to protect the fair administration of justice.”

The private university, located in Des Moines, held an opening celebration for the Johansen Student Center Thursday, according to a news release, housed in the renovated former Morehouse Residence Hall.
A portion of the largest gift in the university’s history, a $28 million donation from alum and board of trustees member Greg Johansen and his wife, Cie, along with other donations allowed for the $16.2 million project to be completed debt-free, according to the release. The rest of the $28 million was split among other capital projects, scholarship funds and athletics.

The center was completely funded by donations through “The Ones: Drake’s Campaign for the Brave and Bold,” a $225 million fundraising campaign launched in 2021 that had amassed more than $265 million by October 2024.
“We are extremely grateful for the generosity of Greg and Cie Johansen, making it possible for the University to convert Morehouse Residence Hall into a vibrant new student center,” said Marty Martin, Drake University president, in the release. “After serving Drake and our students for nearly 100 years as a residence hall, we’re pleased to enhance the historic building and make it a space that can continue to serve our campus community.”
Included in the new center are casual and formal meeting spaces, an outdoor plaza and areas utilized by the Olson Institute for Public Democracy, Darling Institute and Adams Leadership Institute. According to the release, the university’s first intercultural center will also have a home in the center, and more than 150 student organizations will use it for their operations.
According to the release, Drake Student Body President Ashley Dyson said during the event the new center will help bring students together just like Morehouse Residence Hall did in the past.
“On behalf of the student body at Drake, I want to thank the many donors whose support has made this project a reality,” Dyson said in the release. “For almost 100 years, these walls [Johansen Student Center] have served as a place of community amongst our student body. Now the building will continue that legacy by providing a dedicated space for students to build relationships, hone leadership skills, collaborate with community partners, and get plugged into the causes and issues they care about for generations of Drake students to come.”

(AJ Dome for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed a bill Friday she feared would funnel more public money to private educational institutions.
Senate Bill 24 broadened the scope of the Kansas Promise Scholarship, which offers financial aid to Kansans in community college or a technical training program, to include two private institutions — Wichita Technical Institute and the Heartland Welding Academy.
Typically, the scholarship is reserved for not-for-profit schools.
“I have serious concerns about the precedent that would be set by providing state funding to for-profit educational institutions that are not accountable to the state or taxpayers,” said Kelly, a Democrat, in an announcement.
The bill also would have raised the maximum allocation that could be given to institutions across the state from $10 million to $15 million. The scholarship program covers the cost of tuition, books, fees and supplies for students in families below a certain income threshold who want to attend community college or technical school.
”This program is meant to support Kansans as they pursue an education,” Kelly said, “not funnel public money to private, for-profit institutions.”
The Senate passed the bill with unanimous support, and the House passed it 76-48 with nine Republican representatives joining Democrats in opposition.
SB 24 originally dealt with the duties of the state insurance commissioner. Legislators gutted it during negotiations at the end of the session and inserted the contents of Senate Bill 44, in which the scholarship expansion was initially proposed.
Mike O’Neal, who brought the scholarship bill to legislators in January, is a lobbyist for Wichita Technical Institute, among other high-profile clients, and a former House speaker.
“Given the demand for high-quality technical training in Kansas, it makes sense to expand the current eligibility for participation in the Promise Scholarship Act,” O’Neal said in committee testimony in February.
James Genandt, the president of Kansas Technical Colleges, opposed the bill, arguing it would hinder the success of existing programs. Last year, scholarship applications were paused months before the original deadline because of dwindling funds, he said.
“More institutions in the mix will only accelerate the problem,” Genandt said.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, said he was disappointed in the governor’s veto, describing the scholarship program as a successful tool for job development and talent retention. 
“Whether the student attends a public or private school is irrelevant,” Hawkins said, “especially as we face workforce shortages across many industries.”
The Legislature concluded its veto session April 11, leaving no opportunity for Republicans to attempt to override the veto.
House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, a Lenexa Democrat, applauded the veto and thanked Kelly for “protecting public dollars.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/gccc-orientation-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-25 15:22:56.444739

According to a criminal complaint, she’s been charged with obstructing or impeding before a department or agency of the United States and concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest.
Online court records show that the government did not request that Dugan be held in detention and that she was released on an O/R bond, meaning she was released from custody without having to post bail and signed an agreement that she’d appear in court when required.
The agency’s director, Kash Patel, wrote on the social media platform X that Dugan had “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. In the now-deleted post, Patel accused Dugan of creating “increased danger to the public.”
Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 for a pre-trial conference on charges of misdemeanor domestic battery. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents appeared outside Dugan’s courtroom, she led Flores-Ruiz and an attorney out a side door and down a private hallway.
ICE agents later apprehended Flores-Ruiz on foot. This is the third time since March that immigration agents have appeared at the Milwaukee County courthouse to conduct arrests — a tactic that local officials have said threatens to undermine the work of the local justice system by making immigrants fearful of coming to the courthouse to testify in court.
Dugan-Crim-complaint
In an initial statement, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said he was aware of Dugan’s arrest and that the legal process should be allowed to play out.
“Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process,” Crowley said. “We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.”
But later, he accused the FBI of politicizing the arrest to punish perceived enemies.
“It is clear that the FBI is politicizing this situation to make an example of her and others across the country who oppose their attack on the judicial system and our nation’s immigration laws,” he said. “FBI Director Kash Patel issued a public statement on X, which he hurriedly deleted, making unsubstantiated claims about Judge Dugan’s case before charges were officially filed and she could have her moment in court. Director Patel’s statement shows that Trump’s FBI is more concerned about weaponizing federal law enforcement, punishing people without due process, and intimidating anyone who opposes those policies, than they are with seeking justice.”
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said the administration of President Donald Trump is attacking democratic values.
“In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons,” she said. “The President’s administration arresting a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move, and it threatens to breach those very separations of power. Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a Democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by. By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic Democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line. While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this President’s lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress’s checks on his power.”
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) said the arrest was “shocking.”
“This Administration’s willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach,” Moore said. “Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require a high legal bar. I will be following this case closely and facts will come out, however, I am very alarmed at the increasingly lawless actions of the Trump Administration, and in particular ICE, who have been defying courts and acting with disregard for the Constitution.”
The ACLU of Wisconsin wrote on social media that ICE making arrests at courthouses interferes with the work of local justice officials.
“Judges have a duty to maintain order in their courtrooms and ensure the fair administration of justice, and federal law does not require state judges to act as agents of federal immigration enforcement,” the organization said. “Everyone is due their day in court, and when ICE starts showing up to courts looking to make arrests, it risks interfering with those rights. In recent weeks, the administration has attacked the integrity of our judicial system, refused to comply with a Supreme Court order, and arrested a judge for using her authority to protect the fair administration of justice.”

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
Asked for an update Friday, Sanders’ spokesperson said the governor “has been in close contact with the Trump Administration and Secretary Noem as the State provides additional information to appeal its Major Disaster Declaration request and help Arkansans recover from these storms.”
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Two of the three University of Nebraska-Lincoln students whose visas were revoked have had them restored after the Trump administration backed off its efforts to cancel visas held by international students.
UNL officials confirmed the restoration of the visas to the Nebraska Examiner. The Justice Department announced the wholesale reversal in federal court Friday. 
A Justice Department lawyer, Joseph F. Carilli, said that immigration officials have begun developing a new system for reviewing and terminating visas for international students. Until the process is complete, agencies would not make additional changes or further revocations, according to The New York Times.
The reversal comes after the Trump administration began revoking the visas and launching deportation proceedings against a number of students who had participated in demonstrations against Israel during the wave of campus protests last year over the war in Gaza, or who had previous charges, like DUIs. 
Late last week, UNL announced that three international students had had their visas revoked by the U.S. Department of State. UNL has 1,654 international students, according to a university census.
It’s unclear why the other student’s visa is still revoked.

The suit contended gun manufacturer Beretta and gun retailer Bass Pro Shop should have marketed a firearm with safety features sufficient to prevent his injury. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Supreme Court agreed Friday with a district court decision tossing a lawsuit filed by a former Emporia State University football player shot by a teammate who mistakenly believed that disassembling his newly purchased handgun required pulling the trigger.
In 2018, Andre Lewis bought a Beretta APX 9mm handgun at Bass Pro Outdoor World in Olathe. While idling his Dodge Charger at a downtown Emporia stoplight several months later, Lewis decided to show his front-seat passenger, Marquise Johnson, that he knew how to take the gun apart. Court records show Lewis was convinced the gun wouldn’t fire with the magazine removed and that the trigger had to be pulled before disassembly the weapon.
Lewis was wrong on both counts, and the bullet that had been in the chamber struck Johnson in his left leg. The wound resulted  in amputation of the limb below the knee.
Johnson’s attorneys filed a product liability lawsuit against gun manufacturer Beretta and retailer Bass Pro Shops. The suit alleged Bass Pro sold and Beretta manufactured a defective and unreasonably dangerous handgun.
“Unintentional shootings like Marquise Johnson’s are preventable,” said plaintiff’s attorney Jonathan Lowy. “Like any other product, guns can and should be made as safe as possible to make injuries less likely.”
The District Court in Lyons County granted summary judgment in favor of the firearm maker and seller based on a reading of the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. The PLCAA forbids lawsuits against manufacturers or sellers when a person criminally or unlawfully misused a firearm. This federal immunity designed to shield the gun industry wouldn’t hold if the gun was used as intended or in a reasonable way.
The case attracted an amicus brief from Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund that argued the immunity law applied only if the “volitional act, apart from the discharge, constitutes a criminal offense.”
In a split decision, the Kansas Court of Appeals reversed the district court and determined the federal statute didn’t offer immunity to defendants in this case because Lewis didn’t intend to discharge the gun.
In an appeal to the Kansas Supreme Court, however, the firearm manufacturer and dealer argued the Court of Appeals came to the wrong conclusion about application of the federal law and that liability immunity existed because Lewis deliberately pulled the trigger. The state Supreme court found that argument persuasive.
“We hold that firearm sellers’ interpretation is a better reasoned and more accurately reflects Congress’ intent as reflected in the text of the PLCAA,” said Supreme Court Justice K.J. Wall.
Wall, an appointee of Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, said factual disputes about whether Lewis’ actions made him culpable for a criminal offense would typically be resolved by a jury. However, the justice said, it was a violation of state law for Lewis to discharge the gun on a public road.
“Under the unique facts of this case,” Walls wrote, “any dispute about Lewis’ mental state cannot save Johnson’s lawsuit from the PLCAA’s immunity provision.”
He said the Court of Appeals erred by reversing District Court Judge Merlin Wheeler’s decision to grant summary judgement against Johnson.
The court record indicated Lewis purchased the Beretta after reviewing Bass Pro Shop’s “10 commandments of safe gun handling,” which included a rule about keeping the muzzle pointed in a safe direction. Apparently, Lewis reviewed the rules before signing a form to acknowledge he had read them.
The Beretta was accompanied by a user manual that explained the gun could fire even after a magazine had been removed. In addition, the booklet stated the gun’s striker-deactivation button allowed users to disassemble the gun without pulling the trigger.
The Beretta APX had a warning stamped on the gun frame that was on point in the case: “FIRES WITHOUT MAGAZINE.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/P2041412-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-25 15:22:56.444739

Lawmakers have introduced bills on a myriad of topics: constitutional carry, handguns at private schools, and privacy around concealed carry permits, to name a few.
Permitless concealed carry — known as constitutional carry due to the idea that individuals have the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms without infringement — has drawn the most attention.
Senate Bill 50, “Freedom to Carry NC,” allows individuals who are U.S. citizens, at least 18 years of age, and not otherwise prohibited by law to carry concealed weapons without applying for a permit.
It’s backed by Republican leadership and would make North Carolina the 30th state to approve of constitutional carry. The bill has passed the Senate and awaits further approval in the House.
Its counterpart in the lower chamber, House Bill 5 or “NC Constitutional Carry Act,” is largely the same. This measure still needs approval from the House Rules Committee.
The biggest difference in the legislation is HB 5 authorizes elected officials in the state to carry a concealed firearm “while performing their official duties if the official has a concealed handgun permit.” While the State Capitol and Executive Mansion are excluded from this list, it would be allowed at the State Legislative Building and Legislative Office Building, where lawmakers conduct their business.
North Carolina residents are overwhelmingly opposed to the measures, according to newly released polls. But lawmakers have chosen to move forward.
“There is political play around this policy that is lawmakers in both chambers pandering to the far right extremists and, frankly, being more worried about their own primaries… than they are about the safety of their constituents,” Monisha Henley, senior vice president for government affairs at Everytown from Gun Safety, said. “That is why they’ve been trying to push it through the legislature at lightning speed.”
A 2022 study from the Crime Prevention Research Center looked at changes in crime and killings of police after adopting constitutional carry. Using data from 13 states, researchers found that the drop in murder is statistically significant, but the change in violent crime is not.
Paul Valone, president of the Grass Roots North Carolina gun rights group, has spent decades working on the issue. He’s modeled his advocacy after legislation in Vermont, the first state that didn’t have restrictions requiring permits for concealed carry.

“SB 50 and HB 5 are not perfect bills, but they’re what’s achievable right now,” Valone said. “Those of us who have spent a lot of time in the movement believe that because we lost our rights over generations incrementally, we will probably have to win them back incrementally.”
The movement has spread to schools. House Bill 193, “Firearm Law Revisions,” authorizes individuals with a valid concealed handgun permit to possess or carry a handgun on educational property owned, used, or operated by a private school.
The bill’s wording would allow anybody lawfully entitled to carry a concealed weapon to do so on the premises of a private school below the college level, with written permission from the school. This could be school officials, teachers, and even students.
“This bill endangers students, it endangers teachers, and people don’t want it,” Rep. Deb Butler (D-New Hanover) said during a committee hearing. “You’re telling the teachers of North Carolina that we don’t really care what you say.”
Coming up next Tuesday, members of the House Judiciary 2 committee will discuss “The Firearms Liberty Act.” House Bill 674 would among other changes allow for the issuance of lifetime concealed handgun permits.
School districts promote secure storage
NC S.A.F.E. (Secure All Firearms Effectively), a statewide initiative to raise awareness on storing firearms safely, announced a partnership with the Wake County Public School System on Thursday. NC S.A.F.E for Schools is designed to help school districts across the state share resources about safe gun storage with parents in the district.
The Wake County Board of Education unanimously passed a resolution in March of last year to “regularly and consistently” provide families with information and resources on the importance of secure gun storage.
North Carolina experienced at least 12 incidents of gunfire on school grounds in 2024, resulting in one death and nine injuries. Residents of Raleigh’s Hedingham neighborhood are still reeling from an October 2022 mass shooting in which a teenager was able to access his father’s firearms killing five people and wounding two others. The teen charged in that shooting spree will go to trial in 2026.
Research has shown that secure firearm storage practices are associated with up to a 32 percent reduction in the risk of self-inflicted and unintentional firearm deaths.
“As a school system, we have resolved to educate our community on the importance of safe gun storage and its role in protecting students. Whether providing handouts for safety presentations, helpful information for digital communications, or even materials for school resource officers, resources from NC S.A.F.E. have been invaluable to that mission,” Robert Taylor, superintendent of the Wake County Public School System, said in a statement.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission issued a firm rebuttal this week to Attorney General Todd Rokita’s attempt to dismiss a pending ethics complaint accusing him of misleading the court.
In the 44-page brief filed Tuesday, Adrienne Meiring, executive director of the disciplinary commission, called Rokita’s motion “procedurally improper” and “meritless.”
She referenced the Republican attorney general’s filing from February, in which he argued that the pending disciplinary case violates his First Amendment rights and Indiana’s anti-SLAPP law, which is designed to protect political speech from frivolous legal action. 
Meiring repeatedly rejected Rokita’s claims that three new charges filed against the Republican attorney general were politically motivated or an unconstitutional attack on free speech. She urged the state’s high court to move forward with the case.
“This matter is not about politics. It is not about (Rokita’s) viewpoint on any political, social, or cultural issue, nor is it about any executive decision or action by (Rokita) in his statutory office of Indiana Attorney General,” Meiring wrote. “Instead, this matter pertains to the integrity of the judicial system and the attorney disciplinary process.”
Disciplinary commission pushes back
At the heart of the dispute is a press release Rokita issued just hours after the Indiana Supreme Court publicly reprimanded him in November 2023 for earlier misconduct. 
In a sworn affidavit, Rokita admitted to violating professional conduct rules in exchange for a public reprimand. Although he agreed not to contest the charges,  the commission found that Rokita recanted almost immediately, suggesting in a public press release that he had done nothing wrong.
The disciplinary commission held that “this retraction of acceptance of responsibility demonstrates that the respondent was not candid with the court when he attested that he admitted he had violated Indiana Professional Conduct Rules.” One member of the nine-person commission, Lake County Prosecutor Bernard Carter, abstained from the proceedings.
Story continues below.
Commission’s Brief in Opposition
 
Rokita did not contradict the earlier disciplinary agreement — or the sworn affidavit — in his motion to dismiss. Rather, he maintained the disciplinary commission’s latest charges against him violated Indiana law, specifically the “constitutional separation of powers principles.”
The attorney general also said he “should be permitted to speak freely to his constituents without the constant threat of an unelected commission parsing his every word, ready to pounce with a disciplinary action when they perceive any imagined inconsistency.”
“Given the serious constitutional, statutory and factual problems with its case,” Rokita continued, the “right thing” for the commission to do is “withdraw its complaint.”










Few actions could be deemed more in need of the Court’s exercise of its constitutional responsibility than an allegation that a lawyer has lacked candor and been dishonest with the State’s highest court.


– Adrienne Meiring, executive director of the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission


The commission disagreed.
“The Commission has no dispute with Respondent’s right to issue a press release or to discuss the Conditional Agreement and the resolution of his disciplinary case. The fallacy in Respondent’s argument is that he misidentifies the speech involved in this disciplinary matter,” Meiring wrote. “The core issue in this proceeding is whether Respondent was candid with this Court in making sworn statements recited and relied upon in the 2023 Opinion. Simply put, Respondent’s statements to the Court in the 2023 disciplinary proceeding, under oath, are the problematic speech.”
As to Rokita’s free speech claims, Meiring further argued that “the First Amendment does not protect attorney speech that lies or misleads,” and cited multiple state and federal precedents that permit disciplinary sanctions for dishonest conduct by attorneys.
Meiring asserted, too, that Rokita failed to file a required answer to the charges and instead tried to “improperly” use a motion to bypass a formal hearing.
Tensions flare over proposed rules
Rokita additionally accused the commission of retaliating against him for proposing reforms to Indiana’s attorney discipline rules, which he submitted to the state supreme court in November and released to the public in January.
The changes sought to limit the disciplinary commission’s power and protect attorneys from politically driven complaints.

Rokita argued that the commission was aware of the proposal well before it was made public. He said the new disciplinary complaint filed against him at the end of January was a direct response.
Meiring disputed those “groundless” claims at length in this week’s brief.
She called Rokita’s theory baseless, noting that the commission was already bound by a Feb. 4 deadline to conclude its investigation, “and, if appropriate, file charges.”
“(Rokita)’s decision on when to publish his Rules Proposal had no bearing on the Commission’s filing decision,” Meiring wrote.
“Respondent’s decision to publicly release his Rules Proposal on or about January 7, 2025, when the Proposal had been delivered to the Justices two months earlier, was his own timing choice,” she continued. “Respondent cannot create suspicion of retaliation simply by publicizing his Rules Proposal closer to the Commission’s deadline for filing the instant proceeding. Just as a litigant cannot prompt disqualification of a judge via the litigant’s own action of filing an unfounded complaint or lawsuit, Respondent should not be able to prompt dismissal based on alleged ‘suspicious timing’ brought about by his own actions.”
The underlying case
Central to the disciplinary commission’s complaint is Rokita’s sworn conditional agreement regarding his discipline, and a subsequent press release issued by the attorney general.
In a 2022 interview with Fox News commentator Jesse Watters, Rokita called Indianapolis doctor Caitlin Bernard an “activist acting as a doctor” and said his office would be investigating her conduct. Bernard, an OB-GYN, oversaw a medication abortion for a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio in 2022.
That November, a split-decision and public reprimand from state Supreme Court justices found that he had violated two of the Rules of Professional Conduct for lawyers:

They said Rokita’s comments constituted an “extrajudicial statement” that he knew — or reasonably should have known — would be publicly disseminated and would prejudice related legal proceedings.
They also said his statements had “no substantial purpose” other than to embarrass or burden Bernard.

Rokita and the commission agreed to the discipline in the conditional agreement. In a sworn affidavit, Rokita admitted to the two violations and acknowledged he couldn’t have defended himself successfully on the charges if the matter were tried.
Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita seeks dismissal of latest disciplinary commission charges

The parties disputed over a third charge — engaging in conduct “that is prejudicial to the administration of justice” — which the commission agreed to dismiss in exchange for “admission to misconduct” on the others.
Rokita’s punishment included a public reprimand and $250 in court costs.
But the same day the reprimand was handed down, Rokita shared a lengthy and unrepentant statement, defending his “true” remarks in which he attacked the news media, medical field and “cancel culture.”
The disciplinary commission pointed to those remarks — as well as earlier drafts of the statement obtained by subpoena, and a recent quote provided to the Indiana Lawyer — as evidence of Rokita’s “lack of candor and dishonesty to the Court” after he agreed to accept responsibility for misconduct.
A decision on the dismissal motion and the disciplinary commission’s new complaint is up to the Indiana Supreme Court.
If the charges aren’t dismissed — or if the disciplinary commission and Rokita can’t reach a settlement agreement — the state’s high court justices will appoint a hearing officer to hold a public hearing on the case and hear evidence.
It would be up to the hearing officer to then issue findings and recommendations to the court, which has final say over the outcome of the case.
Sanctions depend on the seriousness of the case. Possible sanctions include:

a private or public reprimand;
suspension from practice for a set period of time;
suspension from practice with reinstatement only after the lawyer proves fitness; and

Ron DeSantis deliver the State of the State address on March 4, 2025. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The House tacked on a proposal Friday that would award attorney’s fees to the winning party in insurance litigation to a Senate bill that would extend new legal protections to phosphate mining companies.
The House’s modified version of SB 832 couples insurance litigation changes the Senate has refused to consider with a proposal the chamber already approved. Gov. Ron DeSantis, the state’s insurance regulator, and insurance companies contend the proposal would incentivize lawsuits.
Twenty House lawmakers, mostly Republicans, voted against the bill.
Yet the maneuver is unlikely to create a favorable result for the House because senators didn’t consider any legislation giving policyholders greater access to courts against insurance companies.
“Just because you have gone a slight inch farther in the right direction, doesn’t mean that you solved the problem,” House Speaker Daniel Perez told reporters on Thursday. “We have not solved the problem for property insurance. We sometimes want to pat ourselves on the back for solving the problem because we’ve done a better job.”
Peter Cuderman, DeSantis’ legislative affairs director, sent an email Thursday evening to House lawmakers warning that enacting a loser-pays policy in insurance lawsuits would lead to higher rates for policyholders, citing an analysis he directed the Office of Insurance Regulation to do.
“This legislation poses serious risks to the progress Florida has made in stabilizing the insurance market and the affordability/availability of insurance products in the state,” Cuderman wrote to lawmakers.
The original Senate proposal would establish a defense for companies from lawsuits related to pollution on sites of former phosphate mines had drawn wide support, with only three senators voting against it on April 15.

Alex Brandon-Pool/Getty Images)The U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico on Friday granted a Ghanaian doctoral student at New Mexico Tech a temporary restraining order so his legal team can continue challenging the termination of his F-1 student status by Homeland Security, ACLU of New Mexico announced.
ACLU-NM, which is representing the student — known as K.O.D. in court records —along with Huffman, Wallace & Monagle LLC, on Wednesday filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico.
As Source reported earlier this week, according to court records, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on April 9 abruptly terminated the student’s status in the Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) system, placing K.O.D. in danger of immigration detention and deportation, his attorneys wrote.
“Losing my F-1 status puts my education, research, and career trajectory at risk, and I fear being forced to leave the country before I can complete my Ph.D. program,” the student wrote in a sworn statement included in court records. “This sudden disruption has made me feel vulnerable and anxious, not only about my immediate situation but also about the stability and direction of my life in the years to come.”
In a statement Friday, attorney Shayne Huffman said the court’s ruling “reaffirms that every person within our borders, regardless of where they were born, deserves to be protected from arbitrary actions by the U.S. government. The court has recognized that K.O.D., like other international students, cannot simply have his status terminated without notice or explanation. K.O.D. can now continue his doctoral research without the immediate threat of detention or deportation hanging over his head.”
According to an ACLU-NM news release, New Mexico universities have approximately 2,000 international students. K.O.D.’s lawsuit against Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons will continue, the release notes, and seek permanent relief.
“Today’s ruling sends a clear message that the government cannot arbitrarily target international students,” ACLU of New Mexico senior staff attorney Rebecca Sheff said in a statement. “This is an important first step toward justice for K.O.D. and potentially hundreds of other international students facing similar situations",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/noemelsalvador_1-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-25 14:11:11.567216

(Photo from St. Leo's University)The former mayor of Florida’s third biggest city says he wants to return to finish the job.
Bob Buckhorn led Tampa from 2011 to 2019 before he was term-limited from office. Now, nearly two years away from the next election, he says he wants back in.
“Tampa has more chapters to write and to the extent that I can be helpful I will, ” Buckhorn told the Phoenix in a text message on Thursday night. “It was a job that I loved and the opportunity to lead this city and finish the job would be an honor.”
The 66-year-old Democrat won re-election for mayor by gaining 95% of the vote in 2016, sparking speculation that he would run for Florida governor in 2018. But he announced early in 2017 that, with two teenage daughters at home, “the timing for me and my family would be a challenge.”
There is precedent in Tampa for former mayors running again for office. Dick Greco was elected at  three different times as mayor and just barely missed making a run-off for a fourth term in 2011 (losing by fewer than 400 votes to Buckhorn).
Among Buckhorn’s likely opponents is Tampa City Council Bill Carlson, a noted foe of Buckhorn and sitting Tampa Mayor Jane Castor. Carlson told the Phoenix that he is working on a plan and will announced his candidacy “when the time is right.”
“The community is clearly saying they want to move on from the Castor/Buckhorn era and move toward a positive, collaborative vision that’s focused on people, not buildings,” Carlson said.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) Former LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor Dr. David Guzick, who resigned from his job this week after months of pressure from an LSU Board of Supervisors member, will fill a newly created role in the LSU System. 
The board voted unanimously Friday to name Guzick the system’s chief research officer. The role comes with a salary of $475,000, a significant reduction from his chancellor’s salary of $900,000. 
The board also named Lester Johnson, the medical school’s vice chancellor of academic affairs, as its interim chancellor while a search for Guzick’s replacement happens. A search timeline has not been announced. 
Johnson currently receives an annual salary of $208,763 and will receive a stipend of up to $100,000 for serving as interim chancellor. 
Guzick resigned as chancellor Wednesday following months of pressure from LSU Board member Esperanza Moran, who called for his dismissal at a board meeting last September. Moran has not spoken publicly about why she wanted Guzick removed. 
Moran was at the State Capitol on Wednesday for LSU Day. When a reporter approached to ask about Guzick’s exit, she waved her hand and walked away. 
Guzick had wide support from LSU leadership, including LSU System President William Tate and the top staff at the Shreveport campus. He was praised  for getting the medical school removed from probation by its accrediting body. 
That accomplishment was described as a “grand slam home run in the bottom of the 9th to win” by his top administrators in a letter they sent to Tate in March, urging his support for Guzick. A similar letter was sent by 17 department chairs to the LSU Board of Supervisors last month, when the LSU Health Shreveport Faculty Senate also approved a resolution in support of Guzick.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)FBI agents arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on Friday, accusing her of obstructing an immigration enforcement action last week.
Dugan was arrested at 8:30 a.m. at the county courthouse, according to the U.S. Marshal’s Service. She was scheduled to make an initial appearance in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries at 10:30 on Friday. According to a criminal complaint, she’s been charged with obstructing or impeding before a department or agency of the United States and concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest.
The agency’s director, Kash Patel, wrote on the social media platform X that Dugan had “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. In the now-deleted post, Patel accused Dugan of creating “increased danger to the public.”
Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 for a pre-trial conference on charges of misdemeanor domestic battery. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents appeared outside Dugan’s courtroom, she led Flores-Ruiz and an attorney out a side door and down a private hallway.
ICE agents later apprehended Flores-Ruiz on foot. This is the third time since March that immigration agents have appeared at the Milwaukee County courthouse to conduct arrests — a tactic that local officials have said threatens to undermine the work of the local justice system by making immigrants fearful of coming to the courthouse to testify in court.
In an initial statement, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said he was aware of Dugan’s arrest and that the legal process should be allowed to play out.
“Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process,” Crowley said. “We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.”
But later, he accused the FBI of politicizing the arrest to punish perceived enemies.
“It is clear that the FBI is politicizing this situation to make an example of her and others across the country who oppose their attack on the judicial system and our nation’s immigration laws,” he said. “FBI Director Kash Patel issued a public statement on X, which he hurriedly deleted, making unsubstantiated claims about Judge Dugan’s case before charges were officially filed and she could have her moment in court. Director Patel’s statement shows that Trump’s FBI is more concerned about weaponizing federal law enforcement, punishing people without due process, and intimidating anyone who opposes those policies, than they are with seeking justice.”
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said the administration of President Donald Trump is attacking democratic values.
“In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons,” she said. “The president’s administration arresting a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move, and it threatens to breach those very separations of power. Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by. By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this president is putting those basic democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line. While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this president’s lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress’s checks on his power.”
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wisconsin, whose district includes Milwaukee, said the arrest was “shocking.”
“This administration’s willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach,” Moore said. “Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require a high legal bar. I will be following this case closely and facts will come out, however, I am very alarmed at the increasingly lawless actions of the Trump Administration, and in particular ICE, who have been defying courts and acting with disregard for the Constitution.”

The Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee held a work session for two bills looking to amend the statutory definitions to better identify the children at risk of harm and prevent families from interacting with the child welfare system due to their financial situation. 
“It does a simple thing, but the consequences are enormous,” said committee co-chair Sen. Henry Ingwersen (D-York) of LD 1406, which was backed unanimously by the committee members present Friday.
They did not endorse a similar bill, LD 891, because the language was duplicative but described as “heavy” compared to the other bill. 
Both bills sought out to clarify that a scenario rises to neglect if a child’s needs are willfully withheld. The idea is supported by former foster parents, child welfare advocates and legal organizations; however, some preferred LD 891 because they felt the proposed changes went further to address the issue. 
Maine’s definition of neglect is ‘easy to conflate with poverty’

Rep. Michele Meyer (D-Eliot), who sponsored LD 1406, said her bill was born out of advisory groups that included state agencies, child welfare advocates and other entities dedicated to keeping Maine children safe that looked into the state’s mandated reporting laws and how they affect families. The language in her proposal is modeled after the language Kentucky used to update its definition. 
Even if the claims are unsubstantiated, Meyer said it is still traumatic for families to be reported to child protective services. Additionally, having to weed through reports of parents who can’t financially provide certain needs can mean less time for caseworkers to address situations where children face serious harm. 
At the public hearing for these bills, Bobbi Johnson, the director of the Office of Child and Family Services, testified in support of LD 1406, saying it is part of a broader effort to support families in need rather than getting them tangled up in the system. 
However, she said the child welfare agency is opposed to LD 891 because it inserts certain language that isn’t currently defined in statute and would limit the agency’s ability to intervene in certain accidental situations, even if they are connected to a larger concern about the child’s care.

(AmeriCorps photo)AmeriCorps — one of the programs in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump administration’s quest to downsize the federal government — is a “substantial part” of the work a West Virginia housing construction organization does in Kanawha and Putnam counties, an official from the organization said. 
Last year, volunteers from AmeriCorps’ National Civilian Community Corps contributed 2,880 man hours to work with Habitat for Humanity of Kanawha and Putnam, executive director Andrew Blackwood told West Virginia Watch.
“Just to kind of put that in perspective, a full-time employee would work 2,080 hours in a year,” Blackwood said. “So that’s the equivalent of a little more than a full-time person.”
The Trump administration put most of AmeriCorps’ approximately 650 staff members on administrative leave last week. Members from the National Civilian Community Corps were told they would exit the program early “due to programmatic circumstances beyond your control,” according to reporting by the Associated Press. 
Blackwood said if the federal AmeriCorps funding goes away, the organization will lose the services it provided. The for-profit sector won’t replace it, he said. 
“The needs will go unmet. We only have access to so many volunteers in our community we’re already maximizing the service that they can provide,” he said.
“And so it’s really frustrating when we lose access to that,” Blackwood said. “It’s simply going to mean for us that it’s going to take longer to build each house, which means that there are delays in improving access to affordable housing.”
Last year, the NCCC sent a team of 12 members who worked 40 hours a week for six weeks for Habitat of Kanawha and Putnam. Members also did other volunteer work in the area during their free time, Blackwood said. 
“So their impact actually went beyond their service with us,” he said. 
Habitat for Humanity of Kanawha and Putnam typically partners with volunteers to build two to three houses a year, Blackwood said. The program requires that the homeowner put in at least 250 hours of sweat equity building their home and that of others in the program. In exchange they get a home with an affordable mortgage.
The organization employs one construction manager and relies on the homeowners and volunteers for the rest of the work, Blackwood said. 
Blackwood said the work Habitat does is important, particularly in Kanawha and Putnam counties where there’s not a lot of new housing construction. Existing housing stock is old and in need of repair, the cost of rent has increased to an unaffordable level for many families, he said. 
“Very often, people are spending 40 or 50% of their take home income on housing costs,” he said. “And that just means that they have less money to spend on quality food, education, opportunities, and other things that would strengthen them, whether it’s as an individual or as a family.”
In addition to working with nonprofit organizations, volunteers with NCCC serve with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the U.S. Forest Service, according to the AmeriCorps website. 
When Hurricanes Helene and Milton struck the southeast United States last year, more than 870 AmeriCorps members responded to recovery operations in Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas. Members removed debris, tons of sand, managed
Warehouses and mucked and gutted homes, according to the AmeriCorps website. 
The organization also responded to West Virginia after the 2016 floods killed 23 West Virginians and destroyed countless houses. The Corporation for National and Community Service, which oversees AmeriCorps, sent more than 300 service members to flood-affected areas of the state to assist with recovery. 
White House officials told reporters the cuts are warranted. 
“AmeriCorps has failed eight consecutive audits and is entrusted with over $1 billion in taxpayer dollars every year,” White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said, according to the Washington Post. “It is a target-rich environment for President Trump’s agenda to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse.”
An email to AmeriCorps headquarters went unanswered. 
Blackwood said AmeriCorps solicited requests for the year and his organization submitted a request. He’s not gotten any official word from the agency about its plans for the year following news of the program cuts. 
“We’ve received no official notification, which is also disappointing to hear that partner organizations around the country are really going to be, in some ways, blindsided by these, I’ll call them reckless and thoughtless cuts to a program that directly serves communities across the country,” Blackwood said.

SPRINGFIELD — Insurance companies are reducing the scope of coverage for some community foster agencies in Illinois, leading to higher costs, diminished coverage and fewer options for agencies who say a continuance of the trend could lead to closures.

If the situation worsens, some foster agencies warn they will have to shut down, sending children in their facilities back under the care of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, an agency advocates say doesn’t have the capacity to handle an influx of foster children.

In Illinois, DCFS contracts with community-based foster agencies in order to house and provide services for children in state care. The department reported that the state had about 20,000 foster children in 2024, with more than 4,000 of them in the care of community-based foster or group homes.

These agencies are licensed by DCFS and must have many types of insurance to operate, including liability insurance, which protects them against claims resulting in injuries or damage to property.

If a person sues DCFS and seeks damages, the highest amount they can receive in damages is capped at $2 million – which the state recently extended to foster parents. Lawsuits against community-based agencies, however, do not have a cap. And in recent years, many agencies have faced lawsuits resulting in large payouts or settlements.

In 2018, the father of a 2-year-old boy who died after Lutheran Social Services of Illinois placed him back in the care of his mother sued the foster agency, seeking $45 million in damages.

LSSI placed Lavandis Hudson back in his mother’s care in late 2010. Around six months later, he was rushed to the hospital with severe injuries, where he ultimately died.

The Chicago Tribune reported that a medical examiner ruled Hudson’s death “a homicide caused by multiple blunt-force injuries resulting from child abuse.” Hudson’s mother was charged with first-degree murder in 2012 but has not yet faced trial.

A jury awarded $45 million in damages, although the payout was ultimately about half that due to a deal struck by both parties late in the trial, according to the Tribune.

Other similar lawsuits against foster agencies have resulted in large payouts across the country, even in instances where agencies have denied wrongdoing and claimed negative outcomes were beyond their control. In turn, insurance companies that provide liability coverage for the agencies are taking monetary hit after hit – and raising premium prices or reducing their offerings in response.

The insurers say the risk is too high to continue to insure foster agencies. After a case in California was settled in December for $15 million, Nonprofits Insurance Alliance of California, the main liability insurance provider in the state, announced it would not renew any agency plans and pulled out of California entirely.

Now, that organization is sounding alarm bells as it begins to scale back coverage in other states, including Illinois.

Andrea Durbin, CEO of the Illinois Collaboration on Youth, said in an interview that the crisis is a “very complicated issue.”

“I think people who have been harmed should have opportunities to recover from that harm,” she said. “The complexity of it is, how do you make sure that people get the kind of restitution that they’re entitled to without also completely undermining the community-based infrastructure that serves kids and families today?”
Reduction of coverage

In an interview with Capitol News Illinois, Pamela Davis, the founder, president and CEO of Nonprofits Insurance Alliance, or NIA, said the organization had never previously done a mass nonrenewal like the one in California. She said insurance companies are struggling to distinguish low-risk foster agencies from high-risk ones, since agencies who are doing a “good job” and those who are doing a “bad job” are getting sued the same.

In Illinois, NIA scaled back its coverage by placing $1 million limits on the coverage that protects agencies against claims for physical or sexual abuse, known as Improper Sexual Conduct and Physical Abuse, or ISCPA, coverage. This means that if a foster agency is sued for sexual or physical abuse, NIA will only cover up to $1 million of the settlement – even as many lawsuits are being settled for much more.

Usually, insurance companies offer umbrella coverage beyond the company’s limit. But NIA is also no longer providing umbrella coverage for ISCPA coverage or social services professionals coverage, which protects the agencies’ social workers if they’re sued for misconduct.

The company has also significantly increased the cost of ISCPA coverage, the effects of which were felt by The Center for Youth and Family Solutions – an Illinois provider of child welfare, behavioral health and youth services – which is insured by NIA.

The Center is one of the largest foster agencies in the state, serving more than 1,200 foster children across 37 counties in Illinois. Its CEO, Patrick Phelan, said the total cost for the agency’s professional liability insurance in 2019 was a little more than $45,000. When his agency renewed its insurance earlier this year with NIA, the cost was more than $1 million.

“These costs are going up to the point where, at over $1 million, I could hire 22 family support workers,” Phelan said. “I could go out and hire 22 more people if I was back at my 2019 rates. The impact of this on families is becoming just incredible.”

Phelan said he had to lay off staff and cut additional services in order to pay the insurance bill.

“There are minimums in our contracts that we have to staff positions at, and we’ve always been staffed far higher than the ratios that are demanded by the state contracts,” Phelan said. “But we’re getting closer to being back towards the actual levels. We’re just ultimately worried that the services we provide to our kids and families are going to suffer.”

As costs have increased, Phelan said the agency experienced a decrease in coverage.

“There’s really only two insurers left in Illinois who are offering coverage and neither of them will write a new policy,” Phelan said. “So, if our insurer decides they’re not going to renew us next March, we don’t have the opportunity to go out in the traditional market and find any other insurance. There’s just this huge risk of not being insured going forward.”

Durbin said some agencies simply can’t afford this increase, and since traditional carriers are also not taking any new clients, foster agencies aren’t able to drop their coverage in search of lower rates elsewhere.

“Whether it’s affordable or not is almost completely out of the question at this point because there’s fewer and fewer insurers who are willing to even be in the marketplace,” Durbin said.

In a statement provided to Capitol News Illinois, DCFS called the crisis a “national issue”, saying that “while DCFS is aware of some providers who have received notices of non-renewal for their current insurance, DCFS is not aware of any providers who have been unable to subsequently obtain liability insurance, albeit at a higher cost before their current policy ends.”

Durbin said although it’s “technically correct” to say that no agencies have been unable to find insurance, she’s aware of four that have been dropped by traditional insurance carriers like NIA. She said these agencies were then forced to get insurance through excess and surplus lines, which is a market that sells insurance to cover things traditional insurance companies have deemed high-risk and won’t cover.

“It’s much more expensive for less coverage and just a lower quality kind of insurance product and so it’s a different risk pool,” she said. “So instead of going with the sort of traditional insurers, now you’re in this very high-risk market that’s much more expensive.”

Potential legislation

Illinois lawmakers have filed legislation aiming to curb this crisis, although it hasn’t gained traction this session. Senate Bill 1696, sponsored by Sen. Laura Fine, D-Glenview, and House Bill 3138, sponsored by Rep. Suzanne Ness, D-Crystal Lake, have been described by advocates as “short-term” solutions.

The bills would give agencies immunity from civil liability for two years unless the agency engages in “willful and wanton conduct,” defined as deliberate intention to cause harm, or unintentional harm due to “utter indifference to or conscious disregard” for a child’s safety. The bills would also create a task force to develop and recommend a permanent solution to lawmakers by the end of 2026.

Joseph Monahan – a trained social worker, founder of a Chicago law firm and a member of the Board of Directors at Preferra, a liability insurance company for over 100,000 behavioral health professionals – called the proposal a “start.”

He said some lawyers and advocates take issue with the legislation’s proposed immunity for agencies because they believe it would stop children who have been harmed from receiving “adequate compensation.” One solution some have offered, he said, is to move lawsuits against foster agencies under the jurisdiction of the Illinois Court of Claims, which he said would simply be a more “arduous process” for foster children to have to navigate.

Monahan also took issue with the bill’s proposal of a task force, saying the problem is well documented and arguing for more direct action.

Phelan said although advocates have a good grasp on the issue, he believes bringing everyone to the table to brainstorm a solution via a task force is worthwhile.

A national issue

Davis, the CEO of Nonprofits Insurance Alliance, said the company is also scaling back coverage in Pennsylvania and Florida while Monahan said agencies and advocates in New York and Nebraska are also raising concerns. That’s why advocates are calling for a federal solution.

Durbin said her organization has met with advocates in Illinois, other states, and Congress in an attempt to organize advocates on a national level.

Phelan said U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood, R-Ill., visited The Center’s headquarters in Peoria recently to tour the facility. But Phelan said “the number one topic” on his agenda was to discuss the crisis.

“We were sharing these challenges with him, really hoping that we can help and trying to get some interaction on a federal solution to the problem,” Phelan said.

Although advocates agree that children who are harmed should receive compensation for their experiences, they say the fact that foster agencies don’t have damage caps puts a “target on their back” that some lawyers take advantage of.

“A lot of the opposition is coming from the Trial Lawyers Association, who have recognized us as a source of organizations that can be litigated against,” Phelan said. “And they’re not seeing that, I think, our demise will ultimately leave them with nobody to sue.”

Illinois Trial Lawyers Association President Sara Salger said she “doesn’t know” if there’s been an uptick in the cases of abuse, but that the recent cases with large damage payouts have resulted from “awful cases” of foster children being abused.

“These are the most vulnerable group of people, so to put the solution on the backs of kids who have been abused or raped or, worst case scenario murdered, cannot be the solution,” she said. “It’s an insurance problem and it should have an insurance solution.”

She said she doesn’t agree that the solution to the issue is to indemnify foster agencies.

“There’s just been some awful cases that have resulted in these larger verdicts, but in those situations, the solution shouldn’t be not to hold people accountable for the harm they’re doing to foster children,” Salger said.

The Colorado Legislature is failing to check the Trump administration's attacks pollution-reducing policies and climate action. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)I’ve climbed the Colorado Capitol’s steps over the last few months working to push elected leaders to make real local climate progress while the Trump administration attacks the very idea of environmental justice nationwide and strips key environmental laws. Unfortunately, with only weeks left in the session, I am left worried that Colorado communities are being abandoned by governing bodies.
Every week Trump and his billionaire cronies find new ways to gut the EPA, reverse significant progress on reducing pollution, and undermine public lands protections. Now is the time when Colorado’s elected officials should be creating a bulwark against these attacks on our communities.
In fact, Coloradans are demanding meaningful legislation to protect public lands from mass sell-offs, a rapid transition to 100% clean energy, and affordable energy and transit solutions that help clean up our air. Across every corner of the state thousands have shown up protesting in support of federal workers, many of whom work in the sciences. Progressive politicians Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drew one the largest crowds at the Capitol in recent history.

The call for real action and an agenda that helps working people is loud, but may be going unheard. A rare Democratic trifecta should be an opportunity to champion  policy solutions to Colorado’s environmental problems, preserving clean air and water. So with just weeks left in the session, what did they get up to?
Unfortunately, the 2025 session has been one of frustrating backsliding and failure.
We’ve witnessed several pieces of legislation accelerate through the House and Senate that significantly threaten Colorado’s ability to lead on environmental protections. For example, a bill that defines nuclear energy as a “clean energy resource” was recently signed by the governor, despite similar legislation being easily defeated in previous legislative sessions. Nuclear energy, which is objectively not a clean resource, is extraordinarily expensive and increasingly unrealistic according to experts, distracting us from Colorado’s continued need to invest in proven renewable energy resources such as wind, solar and storage.
In the same vein of pursuing underdeveloped technologies, House Bill 25-1165 advanced through both chambers. It incentivizes experimental carbon capture and storage efforts, which are energy intensive and a false solution to our climate crisis.
But perhaps the most telling example of the Colorado General Assembly’s Democratic leadership to align with the Trump paradigm is an effort to introduce a new Colorado “DOGE” (Department of Government Efficiency). This legislation would grant significant and inappropriate authority to the state auditor and presents existential threats to state agencies tasked with enforcing environmental protections, including the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.
Finally, after claiming that it was too late to introduce a long-developed bill ensuring 100% clean energy by 2040, leaders then introduced a last-minute bill that would give giant tech corporations incentives to build out massive data centers that drain water and potentially drive up energy costs on families and businesses.
This lack of ambition at best, and selling out of our communities at worst, indicate that Colorado’s elected officials at the state Capitol are unwilling or unable to meet the moment we find ourselves in as a state and as a nation. The most hostile federal administration ever elected is recalibrating U.S. priorities. In a state where people value clean air, clean water, public lands and climate action, our public officials should be willing to defy the Trump administration’s attempts to endanger that which we hold dear.
Instead, I fear they’ve capitulated.
Everyday Coloradans and, in particular, disproportionately impacted communities will bear the brunt of the climate inaction in coming years. Organizations like the Sierra Club must continue calling on our leaders to pass bold legislation that reduces emissions, holds polluters accountable, and protects the natural beauty of our state. In the last weeks, let’s see what our leaders can salvage out of this session. While bleak, it isn’t over.
Our members and supporters will continue to push and hope for the best while preparing for the worst.

(Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)The pace of work continues to pick up as the Maine Senate and House of Representatives are meeting for session three days a week to vote on bills. Also, the list of legislation set aside to be funded via the “appropriations table” is growing. 
If bills aren’t explicitly funded in the state budget, they need to be paid for using remaining unappropriated money, which is divided up usually near the end of session when the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee “runs the table.” 
Legislation to increase funding for sexual and reproductive health care services is now among the bills vying for that pot of money. Rather than taking a vote to enact the bill on Thursday, the Senate placed LD 143 on the table after it garnered initial support from the chambers.
While bills placed on the table can still pass, precedent shows that most will die, left on the table without final action by the time the Legislature adjourns. 
Other votes of note:
Both chambers voted this week to back LD 98, which would make school counselors eligible for the Educators for Maine Program, which provides loan repayments for eligible teachers and some other school staff obtaining advanced degrees. 
During the floor debate, Sen. Jim Libby (R-Cumberland) expressed concern with some of the financial details of the grant program and said the Legislature was hand-picking one particular specialist. However, Sen. Joe Rafferty (D-York) said the department bill is “targeting a need,” citing statewide concerns about the mental health of students, he said schools have “a desperate need for counselors.”
Legislation (LD 109) directing the Maine Arts Commission to study national efforts to protect artists from copyright infringement by Artificial Intelligence companies and suggest potential legislation passed the House 80-64 and the Senate 18-14. Some opponents argued that study would be duplicative of efforts by the AI task force created by the governor, pointing to a report of recommendations from that group due in October. But Rep. Dan Sayre (D-Kennebunk), who sits on the task force, argued there’s no need to wait for that report before moving forward with this bill. 
The Senate voted 21-12 and the House 75-64 to back legislation (LD 457) to provide one-time funds to support climate resiliency projects related to the repair of certain historic structures on the Southern Maine Community College campus damaged by erosion and sea level rise. 
A bill (LD 70) to provide one-time funding of $250,000 for each year of the next biennium to the state’s five free health clinics passed the House 78-66 and the Senate 19-13. While opponents, such as Rep. Kathy Javner (R-Chester), said the bill amounted to the Legislature choosing which nonprofits taxpayers should support, Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who sponsored the measure, said “this is probably the best healthcare investment we receive or have in the state of Maine,” noting that all of the health care professionals who work in the clinics donate their time to provide primary care to thousands of people across the state.
The Senate and House passed without a roll call a bill (LD 462) to amend the state retirement system laws to provide credit for service in the U.S. Armed Forces during operations in Lebanon, occurring from August 21, 1982 to February 26, 1984, and operations in Grenada, occurring from October 25, 1983 to December 15, 1983.
A proposal (LD 703) to provide one-time funding of $500,000 for a health care gap year program that incentivizes recent college graduates to work in critical health care positions, particularly in underserved and rural communities passed both chambers. The House voted 87-56 for the bill and the Senate backed it without a roll call.
Both chambers unanimously backed the emergency enactment of LD 678, An Act to Provide for the 2025 and 2026 Allocations of the State Ceiling on Private Activity Bonds.
Both chambers voted under the hammer, without a roll call, to pass: LD 1127, “An Act to Establish Immunity for a Receiver Appointed by the Public Utilities Commission to Oversee the Operations of a Consumer-owned Water Utility;” LD 884, “Resolve, to Establish the Criminal Justice Legal Aid Clinic Pilot Project at the University of Maine School of Law;” and LD 238, “An Act to Protect Emergency Medical Services Persons’ Right to Work in Multiple Health Care Settings.”
Senate action
The Senate voted to confirm Donald Marean and Chandler Woodcock to the State Harness Racing Committee. The members also voted for the reappointment of Roger Katz to the University of Maine Board of Trustees and Emily Becker to the Maine Turnpike Authority Board of Directors.
The Senate voted 17-15 to reject a proposal (LD 717) that would strike a provision from the Maine Criminal Code regarding economic loss and restitution that would require a defendant to be convicted of trafficking and the court finding that the conviction was motivated by profit.
Senators voted 21-12 to reject a bill (LD 939) that would have increased the maximum permissible size of recreational campfires.
Members passed under the hammer: LD 606, and emergency bill to “Study Barriers to Financial Assistance Programs for Farmers and Food Producers;” LD 413, “An Act Regarding Disclosure by Sellers of Residential Real Property of Notices of Shoreland Zoning Ordinance Violations;” LD 36, “An Act to Clarify Processes of the Board of Environmental Protection;” and  LD 465, “An Act to Update Waste Discharge License Fees.” 
House action
The House voted 109-33 against a bill (LD 265) that would prohibit the Maine National Guard from combat deployment absent an official act of Congress (more on the bill here). The floor debate highlighted the belief that Congress is shirking its duty by allowing the executive branch to initiate war, as co-sponsor Rep. Tracy Quint (R-Hodgdon) put it. However, others pointed to General of the Maine National Guard Dianne Dunn’s opposition to the bill and her belief that it would ultimately hurt Maine people.
Members of the House voted without a roll call to kill legislation (LD 502) which would have amended some of the laws restricting the use of outdoor wood boilers. 
The House also voted under the hammer to pass: LD 1150, “An Act to Require Reporting of Sheltering or Aiding Missing Children;” LD 296, “An Act to Appropriate Funds to the Department of Environmental Protection, Lake Water Quality Restoration and Protection Fund;” and LD 398, an emergency “Act to Amend the Definition of ‘Transient Occupancy’ in the Laws Governing the Maine Land Use Planning Commission.”
Committee action
The Judiciary Committee decided to table two bills (LD 208 and LD 1230) that would repeal the law requiring a 72-hour waiting period after the purchase of a firearm. Because the law that took effect last August is currently being challenged in court, committee members said they would like to see what happens with the lawsuit before determining any changes to make.
Several bills were also moved to the “appropriations table,” where the budget committee can choose to support the measures with any remaining funds. These included: 

LD 400, “Resolve, Directing the Department of Public Safety, Office of the State Fire Marshal to Compile a Statewide Inventory of Aqueous Film-forming Foam Concentrate” (read more about this bill here)
LD 522, “Resolve, Directing the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women to Study the Extent of Workforce Gender Segregation in the State;” 
LD 875, “An Act to Fund Essential Services for Victims of Domestic Violence” (read more here)
LD 415, “An Act to Support Hunger Prevention in Maine” (read more here)
LD 815, “An Act to Provide Funding for Respite Care and Supplemental Services Provided by the Family Caregiver Support Program;” 
LD 840, “An Act to Modernize the State Supplement to Supplemental Security Income by Removing Marriage Disincentives” 
LD 143, “An Act to Improve Women’s Health and Economic Security by Funding Family Planning Services” (read more here)
LD 689, “An Act to Support the Northern New England Poison Center”

“It’s my money. It isn’t a whole lot in the scheme of things, but I earned it,” Serrault told Source in a written statement. “The system put it away for me and I would like to keep it so that I can remain independent for the time I have left.
In recent months, the Trump Administration has made cuts to Social Security Administration staff and department budgets, prompting concerns over timely receipt of payments and the possibility of reductions in payments.
Serrault, an 84-year-old Las Cruces resident, told Source NM that she is just one missed payment away from being unable to afford rent and other necessities.
“I don’t know what’s going to happen if they hit Social Security and they also hit Section 8 [housing]. I’m going to be on the street, unless there’s some kind of safety net that could be developed,” Serrault told Source in a phone interview.
Serrault added that after paying her bills, she is left with about $250 to $300 for food each month, if she’s “lucky.”
 


 Members of NM congressional delegation demand state’s Social Security offices remain open
U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) and Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM), as well as U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-NM)  joined more than 100 members of Congress this week asking the Acting Commissioner of the Social Security Administration to keep local field offices open.
The letter followed reports that the General Services Administration had targeted some of the offices for closure, which the Social Security Agency has denied.
“Field offices provide vital services to Social Security recipients, and beneficiaries need the opportunity to seek assistance from SSA in person,” the letter reads. “Closing any of these field offices will make it harder for individuals to access their benefits.”
New Mexico hosts 10 field offices throughout the state and, according to a news release from Heinrich’s office, more than 468,000 New Mexicans receive benefits from the department. More than 55,000 additional New Mexicans receive Supplemental Security Income.
 


Many New Mexicans receiving social security benefits share these concerns, according to a survey conducted by Democratic U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez’s team. Out of the nearly 600 constituents who responded to the survey, about 87% expressed uneasiness.
Vasquez’s team shared respondents’ first names, ZIP codes and comments with Source, which then selected several people from the list for interview requests. Vasquez’s representatives provided Source’s email contact to those willing to talk.
Cinda Gillilan, 63, lives in Silver City and works as an administrator at an assisted living facility. Gillilan has multiple degrees and has spent the last decade working in social work, but due to limited pay, she and her partner have little in savings and no 401K.
She told Source that she and her partner plan to retire when they are 70 and live off of Social Security, but worries that changes and cuts to the Social Security Administration will leave them with very little.
“When we looked at the cost of living throughout the country, even here in New Mexico in Silver City, our rent has gone from $700 to $900 a month. And on Social Security, that would be a huge portion of one of our two checks,” Gillilan said. “We’re seriously considering leaving the country in 2032 when we’re both 70.”
She said they are looking at relocating to Costa Rica, Portugal, Italy or Malta, where their money from Social Security will go further than in the U.S. However, Gillilan told Source that she worries that in the next seven years “there won’t be a functional system by the time we’re ready to use it.”
She said she hears similar concerns in her work at the assisted living facility. One man is facing the possibility of losing Medicaid assistance and having to leave the facility.
“I think it’s incumbent upon the state to start thinking about what do we do if people start losing Social Security? What do we do if people lose their Medicaid benefits or their Medicare benefits? How do we respond?” Gillian said. “And I think they have to get ahead of that curve and get proactive.”
Like Gillilan is considering doing, Carolmarie Seager, 66, chose to retire and move out of the country. She moved to the United Kingdom in 2018 and now lives in a town in Wales, but still maintains a Las Cruces address.
“What did I leave behind? My five adult children, a granddaughter, and now a new grandson. I left behind friends, siblings, their families, my sweet mother, and much more,” Seager told Source NM in a written statement. “In addition to the political nightmare, I chose to leave the U.S. because NM was getting too hot to live in inexpensively, and I knew my medical care would become more expensive without my mild Multiple Sclerosis condition getting any worse.”
Seager said she lives on a combination of benefits that includes Social Security, and that her payment was “quite late this month with no explanation.” She said she wouldn’t be able to pay her living expenses if her Social Security payment was changed, and she wouldn’t be able to afford to move back to the U.S.

Alyna LaValley, 66, lives in Truth of Consequences with her husband. She told Source NM that they both live off of their social security benefits, as well as long-term disability.
LaValley’s concerns are compounded because she is a transgender woman and moved to New Mexico from Florida because the state was restricting transgender rights. The Trump administration has taken multiple steps in recent months to rescind rights and support for transgender people at the federal level, including denying new passports, restricting gender-affirming care and reinstating a ban on transgender people serving in the military.
LaValley told Source that she fears for her safety and worries about even leaving her house at times. And she added that if their benefits are cut in anyway, they will likely lose their house.
“We’ll be on the street,” she said. “There is no American dream. People can’t afford to buy houses. There’s no way to get ahead. It’s gone. And I feel bad for the world that my grandchildren are going to live in.”

(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)Convicted grifter Michele Fiore getting pardoned by fellow convicted grifter Donald Trump reflects a casual disregard for law enforcement, and a blithe disrespect for one former law enforcement official in particular: Nevada’s Republican governor.
Money Fiore raised to build a statue honoring a police officer killed in the line of duty was reportedly spent on plastic surgery and other expenses incurred in the course of the care and feeding of Michele Fiore.
Gov. Joe Lombardo testified at Fiore’s trial as a self-described “victim” of Fiore’s grift. While sheriff running for reelection, Lombardo’s campaign contributed $5,000 to Fiore’s purported memorial effort in 2019.
Lombardo is declining to comment on Fiore’s pardon. That’s too bad, because it would be fun to watch him yet again try to thread that needle between expressing mild non-approval of some bat guano thing Trump did or said yet not get browbeaten by some Trump flunky as a result.
Nevada also has a right to know if Lombardo, the governor after all, is in the loop. Was he informed about Fiore’s pardon beforehand, and if so, who informed him? Someone from the White House? A gloating Fiore herself? Interim U.S. attorney for Nevada (and Fiore’s fellow full-on MAGAwhackadoodle kindred spirit) Sigal Chattah?
Or did Lombardo find out about it at the same time as everybody else?
When Fiore was convicted in October, noting how Fiore wears her weapons worship on her sleeve, I joked in the Daily Current newsletter that “Maybe her beloved idol Trump will pardon her and appoint her director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.”
Well, we’re halfway there.
In a statement dripping with pathetic melodrama and theatrical piety, Fiore said for now she’ll be returning to a different job for which she is woefully unfit on countless levels and to which she never should have been appointed in the first place, Nye County’s justice of the peace in Pahrump. But it’s not clear if that’s going to happen. 
And frankly, now that Trump, during a break from his busy schedule of wrecking the global economy and imposing misery and despair on untold millions, gave her brand as a Trumpy grifter extraordinaire a boost, Fiore can probably land, if not the ATF job, at least a position that’s both more high-high profile and better-paying.
Maybe Chattah is staffing up the U.S. attorney’s office in Nevada to launch lawfare and retribution against people who have displeased Michele Fiore, and will name Fiore special DOJ agent in charge? Maybe Chattah’s office will buy Fiore an armored Cybertruck!
Meanwhile, to reiterate, all this is demeaning to Lombardo, and makes him look snubbed and small. And to think just earlier this month Lombardo went to such great pains to showcase his capacity for MAGAliciously crude and hateful buffoonery. As the master and model of the genre used to always say: Sad.

FBI agents arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on Friday, accusing her of obstructing an immigration enforcement action last week.
Dugan was arrested at 8:30 a.m. at the county courthouse, according to the U.S. Marshal’s Service. She was scheduled to make an initial appearance in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries at 10:30 on Friday. According to a criminal complaint, she’s been charged with obstructing or impeding before a department or agency of the United States and concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest.
The agency’s director, Kash Patel, wrote on the social media platform X that Dugan had “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. In the now-deleted post, Patel accused Dugan of creating “increased danger to the public.”
Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 for a pre-trial conference on charges of misdemeanor domestic battery. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents appeared outside Dugan’s courtroom, she led Flores-Ruiz and an attorney out a side door and down a private hallway.
ICE agents later apprehended Flores-Ruiz on foot. This is the third time since March that immigration agents have appeared at the Milwaukee County courthouse to conduct arrests — a tactic that local officials have said threatens to undermine the work of the local justice system by making immigrants fearful of coming to the courthouse to testify in court.
Dugan-Crim-complaint
In a statement, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said he was aware of Dugan’s arrest and that the legal process should be allowed to play out.
“Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process,” Crowley said. “We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.”
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said the administration of President Donald Trump is attacking democratic values.
“In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons,” she said. “The President’s administration arresting a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move, and it threatens to breach those very separations of power. Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a Democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by. By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic Democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line. While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this President’s lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress’s checks on his power.”
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) said the arrest was “shocking.”
“This Administration’s willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach,” Moore said. “Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require a high legal bar. I will be following this case closely and facts will come out, however, I am very alarmed at the increasingly lawless actions of the Trump Administration, and in particular ICE, who have been defying courts and acting with disregard for the Constitution.”

(Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)FBI agents arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on Friday, accusing her of obstructing an immigration enforcement action last week.
Dugan was arrested at 8:30 a.m. at the county courthouse, according to the U.S. Marshal’s Service. She was scheduled to make an initial appearance in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries at 10:30 on Friday. According to a criminal complaint, she’s been charged with obstructing or impeding before a department or agency of the United States and concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest.
The agency’s director, Kash Patel, wrote on the social media platform X that Dugan had “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. In the now-deleted post, Patel accused Dugan of creating “increased danger to the public.”
Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 for a pre-trial conference on charges of misdemeanor domestic battery. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents appeared outside Dugan’s courtroom, she led Flores-Ruiz and an attorney out a side door and down a private hallway.
ICE agents later apprehended Flores-Ruiz on foot. This is the third time since March that immigration agents have appeared at the Milwaukee County courthouse to conduct arrests — a tactic that local officials have said threatens to undermine the work of the local justice system by making immigrants fearful of coming to the courthouse to testify in court.

Dugan-Crim-complaint 
In a statement, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said he was aware of Dugan’s arrest and that the legal process should be allowed to play out.
“Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process,” Crowley said. “We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.”
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said the administration of President Donald Trump is attacking democratic values.
“In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons,” she said. “The President’s administration arresting a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move, and it threatens to breach those very separations of power. Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a Democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by. By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic Democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line. While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this President’s lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress’s checks on his power.”
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) said the arrest was “shocking.”
“This Administration’s willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach,” Moore said. “Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require a high legal bar. I will be following this case closely and facts will come out, however, I am very alarmed at the increasingly lawless actions of the Trump Administration, and in particular ICE, who have been defying courts and acting with disregard for the Constitution.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2397-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-25 13:15:45.795846

(Kenneth Ferriera-Pool/Lincoln Journal Star)LINCOLN — A nonpartisan watchdog and a Lincoln state senator filed requests this week to learn more about private and state resources spent against 2024 ballot measures, namely medical cannabis.
The first complaint came from executive director Gavin Geis of Common Cause Nebraska, a nonpartisan organization focused on government accountability. 
Geis filed a complaint Thursday with the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission requesting an investigation into whether John Kuehn, a former state senator and a lead opponent to medical cannabis in the state, failed to disclose related legal expenses in his late 2024 challenge of the related ballot measures before and through the election.

Kuehn filed an initial lawsuit in September on his own behalf seeking to declare the ballot measures “legally insufficient and invalid.” The Lancaster County District Court sided with the ballot measure, and Kuehn is appealing to the Nebraska Supreme Court.
After the election, Kuehn filed a second lawsuit seeking to invalidate the laws, citing federal preemption. Thirty-eight other states have approved medical cannabis and lawmakers continue work to help implement additional regulations.
The NADC confirmed receipt of a complaint from Geis. Under state law, neither the NADC nor Geis can speak about the investigation further until its conclusion, or if Kuehn speaks out.
A 2001 advisory NADC opinion said expenditures against a ballot measure not related to its qualification, passage or defeat, such as constitutionality, are not a campaign service.
Public disclosure laws
Geis said in a news release that “Nebraskans deserve to know who’s working to influence our elections,” whether that is Kuehn or someone on behalf of Kuehn.
“Allowing special interests or individuals to oppose ballot measures without disclosing their spending undermines our citizen initiative process,” Geis said. “If we want to ensure Nebraskans’ voices are heard, we must enforce disclosure laws that show the public who stands against them.”
Geis’ complaint cites state law requiring an individual challenging the “qualification, passage or defeat of a ballot question” over $250 to report such expense.
Geis said that if lawsuits are not covered in this way under current disclosure laws, the Legislature should strengthen them.


Past marijuana-related disclosure complaint was dismissed in 2021
In 2021, the nonprofit Nebraska Families 4 Medical Cannabis filed a Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission complaint against Lancaster County Sheriff Terry Wagner. He helped boot a medical cannabis constitutional amendment from the November 2020 election when the Nebraska Supreme Court agreed 5-2 with Wagner’s attorney that the measure was too broad.
The NADC complaint alleged that Wagner, as an elected official, needed to disclose any “gift” over $100 he received to file and pursue the case on his annual disclosures.
The NADC ultimately dismissed the complaint, finding that Wagner did not solicit the money and therefore was not a “gift.” Wagner had said he didn’t know who paid for the lawsuit in 2020, according to the Lincoln Journal Star.


Elections lawsuit continues
Kuehn, approached Thursday afternoon by a reporter, said it was the first he had heard of the complaint. He did not respond to multiple requests for comment, including on whether he or someone else funded the election-related challenge.
As part of that first challenge — Kuehn v. Secretary of State Bob Evnen and the three sponsors of the ballot measure campaign — the Attorney General’s Office joined Kuehn in seeking to invalidate the measures before the November election, alleging widespread fraud. 
Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong rejected those arguments.
More than 200,000 signatures were collected between the campaign’s legalization and regulatory petitions. They passed with 71% voter approval and 67% voter approval, respectively.
Kuehn’s legal team included an attorney from Texas, and his team hired the services of an out-of-state cloud-based petition validation service, Signafide, to review the petitions. Artificial intelligence and manual labor were used in that process.
‘Politically charged litigation’
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln sent a Wednesday request to Attorney General Mike Hilgers “in the interests of government transparency and legislative oversight.”
“As always conscious stewards of taxpayer funds and in light of the present fiscal situation, it is important for senators to appreciate the expenses your office has incurred in pursuing an aggressive politically charged litigation agenda under and within your sole discretion,” Conrad wrote in her two-page letter shared with the Nebraska Examiner.
The state currently faces a projected budget deficit for the next two fiscal years of $457 million, as the Appropriations Committee has worked to whittle that down to $0. 
As of Thursday, when the baseline budget advanced 7-1, it was still $124 million short under state law. Two bills advanced Thursday would help build a positive $7 million, if passed.
That’s before the Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board returns Friday afternoon, where many senators expect to be hit with an additional $100 million hole, at the least.
 Specific cases targeted 

Conrad narrowed her request to expenses regarding ballot measures last year, including:

Staff time.
Filing fees.
News conferences.
Administrative costs.
Social media or other paid advertising.
Mileage, travel, lodging or related expenses.
Litigation expenses such as deposition costs, discovery expenses, expert consultation, outside counsel (or co-counsel, experts or outside attorneys needed to be hired to defend other state actors).

  State Sens. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln and Ben Hansen of Blair. April 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
She specifically asked for related costs to State ex rel. Brooks v. Evnen before the Nebraska Supreme Court in September (abortion), State ex rel. Collar v. Evnen before the Nebraska Supreme Court in September (school choice), Kuehn v. Evnen and others in Lancaster District Court and now the Nebraska Supreme Court through 2024 and into 2025 (medical cannabis) and Kuehn v. Gov. Jim Pillen and others in Lancaster County District Court (medical cannabis).
The AG’s Office hired a forensic document examiner from Colorado as a handwriting expert to review a handful of petition pages in the election-related case from Kuehn last year.
Conrad also included the state’s criminal case against Jacy Todd of York in Hall County District Court and Hall County County Court. Todd is a public notary who helped the medical cannabis campaign and is believed to be the first notary ever criminally charged in this manner. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing.
Hall County District Judge Andrew Butler this week questioned the extent of resources being used to pursue 24 counts of “official misconduct” against Todd, when looking at the current climate of the state and voice of its residents.”
The Attorney General’s Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment. It has traditionally not disclosed specific litigation costs.

(Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images) ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.

“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

A woman approached Hageman after a Wheatland town hall and waved her hands in the congresswoman’s face, causing an officer to intervene. The woman apologized.
The post Animated elderly woman behind police incident at Hageman town hall in Wheatland, report shows appeared first on WyoFile .","Following a March town hall in Wheatland, an elderly woman approached Rep. Harriet Hageman and spoke in an “aggressive manner” with her hands close to the representative’s face, a Wheatland Police Department report released to WyoFile this week shows. 
One of Hageman’s staff members moved between the elderly woman and the lawmaker, and a Wheatland police officer took hold of the elderly woman’s wrists. The woman apologized and walked away, according to the report. No charges were filed and the officer does not appear to have taken down the woman’s name. 
There were no other incidents that required law enforcement either during or after the event, according to Wheatland Police Sgt. Dalton Minsaas’ report. 
Hageman cited the Wheatland incident as one of the safety threats that spurred her to move her town halls online for a time. Hageman this week restarted in-person town halls in Buffalo and Dayton, but required people to register for them ahead of time.
The Wheatland police report aligns with Hageman’s account of the incident, but provides more detail.  
“An attendee followed Hageman leaving the venue and initiated a physical confrontation with staff, into which local police were forced to intervene,” Hageman’s staff wrote in their March statement about moving town halls online. 
The March 20 Wheatland town hall followed a raucous event in Laramie the night before, where Hageman was booed and heckled by people upset by the actions of President Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk. Still, law enforcement at the Laramie event told WyoFile there were no incidents and officers did not remove anyone.

In Wheatland, security was significant and led by the Platte County Sheriff’s Office. Four Wheatland PD officers joined deputies guarding the event, with different assignments, according to a second police report released to WyoFile, this one written by Sgt. Russell Swingle. 
Hageman also cited the strain placed on law enforcement resources as a reason for moving her events online. In Buffalo on Thursday night, she met a mixed reception that included both support and jeering, the Cowboy State Daily reported. 
There were no incidents that required an intervention from law enforcement, Buffalo Police Department Captain Garth Nicholas told WyoFile on Friday. 
WyoFile requested the Wheatland reports under the Wyoming Public Records Act on March 27. They were released Thursday, although it’s not clear when the reports were written. Traci Swingle, the department’s administrative assistant, told WyoFile she was unable to provide that information. 
Constituent anger
Republican lawmakers nationwide have faced anger and indignation from their constituents when they’ve returned from Washington, D.C. to their home states, as the Musk-led DOGE initiative continues to sharply reduce and restructure government programs. 
Hageman cast the people who heckled her in Laramie and elsewhere as organized protesters, and some conservatives falsely suggested they had come into the state from elsewhere to flood the events — or were even paid protesters.
The police reports show Hageman faced upset constituents in Wheatland too.
“During the town hall, I could hear ‘boos’ from the crowd,” wrote Swingle, who was posted in the lobby of Wheatland High School, where the town hall was held.
Minsaas was standing by the high school auditorium’s entrance as people were exiting. Hageman came up a set of stairs toward the doors where Minsaas was posted, and the officer watched “an elderly female” who was “moving in a quick manner to get close to Hageman.” 
One of Hageman’s staffers, who is not named in the report, stepped between the two women, Minsaas wrote. Hageman’s staff did not respond to a WyoFile request for additional details about the incident. 
“The elderly female was communicating to Hageman in what appeared to be an aggressive manner,” Minsaas wrote. “I also observed the elderly female’s hands were up and close to Hageman’s face.” 
The officer “gained control” of the constituent’s wrists, he wrote, and “explained to her that she could communicate with Hageman, but she needed to keep her hands to her side.” The woman apologized and walked away. 
Hageman’s staff and law enforcement walked with the congresswoman out of the building. 
“There is nothing further to report on this matter,” Minsaas concluded.

Making hard decisions is never fun. No one wakes up excited to deliver news that will upset people, especially not in a city that’s already been through so much.
But leadership isn’t about winning popularity contests. It’s about doing what needs to be done — even when it’s uncomfortable, even when it makes you the villain in someone else’s story. If taking the heat today means a better tomorrow for Jackson, I’ll take it.
I’ve seen what failure looks like up close. I stood in the water plants when the system collapsed. There were no doors on critical buildings, and exposed pipes in below freezing temps. I’ve watched as the people of this city lined up for bottled water when they should have been at Christmas dinner. And I’ve spent the past two and a half years trying to make sure that never happens again.
That’s why we’re asking for a modest rate increase. I know how that sounds. No one likes to hear the words “higher bill,” especially in a place where too many are already stretched thin. But the truth is, the system can’t run on yesterday’s rates. It takes over $80 million a year to operate Jackson’s drinking water system responsibly. When we stepped in, the city was trying to run it on just $15 million to 18 million per year over several years. That’s not sustainable. It’s not safe. And it’s not fair to residents who deserve reliable service.

We’ve done the analysis. We’ve looked at every line item. We’ve streamlined operations and improved collections. We’ve reduced the base charge for the lowest- income customers on SNAP. This isn’t about spending more. It’s about spending what it actually costs to keep water flowing.
And no, we can’t just use federal funding to fill the gap. Of the much-talked-about $800 million in federal funds (in reality $600 million), only $150 million was flexible and available for operations—and most of that is gone with nearly $75 million going to fix extensive water leaks that needed to be repaired to restore pressure to residents. The rest is earmarked for specific infrastructure projects and cannot be used for day-to-day costs like staff, water treatment chemicals or power bills. We’ve been transparent about that from the beginning.
These federal funds are essential, but they’re not a substitute for sustainable, recurring revenue. A one-time grant doesn’t keep a system running year after year. The only way to do that is by charging what it actually costs to deliver water service — nothing more, nothing less.
I’ve heard the questions from the City Council and others. Why not just cut costs? Why not collect from everyone who owes? We’re doing both. Collections are up. Our systems are tighter. But even with perfect collections, we’d still face a massive shortfall.
The gap is not about wasteful spending. It’s about the true cost of running a water system that works. And when you’re facing that kind of gap, raising rates can’t be a political decision. It has to be a business decision — grounded in real data, responsible analysis and a clear-eyed view of what it takes to serve this city well. This is about financial sustainability, not short-term optics.
If we implement this rate structure now, we’ll be on track to reach full financial stability by 2029. That means balanced budgets, three months’ worth of cash reserves and meeting every debt obligation. No bailouts. No Band-Aids. Just a water system that works, day in and day out. That’s the goal. And it’s within reach if we have the courage to act now.
Cities across the country are facing the same challenges — aging infrastructure. rising costs. tough trade-offs. The difference is that some choose to kick the can down the road.
We’ve seen where that leads. Jackson has already lived through what happens when tough choices are avoided for too long. We can’t afford to do that again. This time, we’re facing the facts. We’re taking the hits. And we’re making the call.
So yes, I’ll be the bad guy if it means better for Jackson. I didn’t grow up here. But over the two years I’ve been here, I’ve come to love this city deeply — its food, its music, its humor and most of all, its people. I’ve sat in churches, broken bread in neighborhood restaurants and listened to people who want nothing more than to see Jackson thrive.
That’s why I want better for this place — not as a detached manager, but as someone who now feels personally connected to the soul of this city — its people.
This isn’t just about fixing pipes and balancing budgets. It’s about protecting the dignity of a city that deserves better, and helping ensure that the people who’ve stuck with Jackson through its hardest days can finally see it rise. It means families can turn on the tap and trust what comes out. It means we never again see the chaos and fear of a city without water. That’s the job. And I’m here to do it.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A public hearing Tuesday in Wichita will give Black Hills Energy customers an opportunity to comment on a proposal that would raise residential bills by about 17.6%. 
For a customer with average usage, that equates to an additional $11 per month to take effect in the second half of 2025, according to a Kansas Corporation Commission press release. Black Hills provides natural gas service to approximately 120,000 Kansas customers, primarily in the southern half of the state.
The company filed a request with KCC to increase rates in early February. Its last rate review was in 2021 and its most recent new revenue request was in 2014. In testimony, company officials said Black Hills has experienced declining residential usage per customer. In addition, increased insurance costs and investments in infrastructure are affecting revenue.
“Presently effective rates do not produce sufficient revenues to cover the reasonable cost of Applicant’s continued ability to render reasonably sufficient and efficient service,” the company said in testimony. 
The public hearing begins at 6 p.m. Tuesday at Lowe Auditorium, Hughes Metropolitan Complex, 5015 E. 29th St. North, in Wichita. Participants who want to comment or ask questions must register in advance by noon Monday on KCC’s website. The hearing also will be broadcast on KCC’s YouTube channel.

Dugan was arrested at 8:30 a.m. at the county courthouse, according to the U.S. Marshal’s Service. She was scheduled to make an initial appearance in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries at 10:30 on Friday. According to a criminal complaint, she’s been charged with obstructing or impeding before a department or agency of the United States and concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest.
The agency’s director, Kash Patel, wrote on the social media platform X that Dugan had “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. In the now-deleted post, Patel accused Dugan of creating “increased danger to the public.”
Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 for a pre-trial conference on charges of misdemeanor domestic battery.

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Gov. Kim Reynolds signs natural disaster assistance bill into law

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

Tate Reeves vetoed a bill Thursday that would help stabilize hospitals, calling it the “Grady Twin” of a bill he vetoed in March. 
Lawmakers made some changes to the previously vetoed legislation in a new bill, but kept much the same. Reeves cited many of his same concerns this time around, including alleged contradictions and the loom of a deficit. 
The bill, authored by Senate Medicaid Chairman Kevin Blackwell, R-Southaven, sought to make several changes to the Medicaid program – from mandating providers screen mothers for postpartum depression to requiring the agency to cover a new sleep apnea device. 
Blackwell did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication. 
Arguably the largest impact of Senate Bill 2386 would have been that it called for locking in place supplemental payment programs that have been a lifeline for hospitals – but which are unreliable as they vary from year to year, according to Richard Roberson, CEO of the Mississippi Hospital Association.
That fluctuation makes it difficult for hospitals to plan what services they can offer. 
“The supplemental payment language was intended to offer better budget predictability as hospitals move through these uncertain times and instructed the Division (of Medicaid) to maximize federal funding,” Roberson said. “… Hospitals, like other businesses, need stability to continue to serve their communities effectively.”
Supplemental payment programs bring in around $1.5 billion federal dollars to Mississippi hospitals each year. 
Reeves said in his veto statements for both bills that locking the payment program in place is in contradiction with another of the bill’s mandates, which would change the program to allow out-of-state hospitals that border Mississippi to participate in the program. 
“It is logically nonsensical for Senate Bill 2386 to, on the one hand, freeze the MHAP, while on the other hand, mandate that the Division open the program to include an additional hospital.”
But Roberson said the language of the bill would not prohibit the programs from growing – it would merely clarify what hospitals need to do to get paid. 
Reeves again said the bill “seeks to expand Medicaid.” The bill brings forth code sections related to eligibility requirements, but it doesn’t call for expanding the Medicaid population by increasing the income threshold, which is what is typically referred to as Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.
Thursday’s vetoed bill was hospitals’ last recourse for stabilizing their budgets via legislation. 
Richardson says the Mississippi Hospital Association has now turned its sights toward the Division of Medicaid to secure hospitals’ payment programs without the help of the Legislature. 
“With or without Senate Bill 2386, we are hopeful the Division will work to stabilize the model,” Roberson said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/29194330/State-of-the-State-10.jpg,,,2025-04-25 12:18:16.984341

“Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process,” Crowley said. “We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.”
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) said the arrest was “shocking.”
“This Administration’s willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach,” Moore said. “Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require a high legal bar. I will be following this case closely and facts will come out, however, I am very alarmed at the increasingly lawless actions of the Trump Administration, and in particular ICE, who have been defying courts and acting with disregard for the Constitution.”

(Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images) ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”


Coming Monday on NC Newsline
In early May, the state will begin fielding offers from companies to demolish, repair and rebuild homes destroyed by Helene, the deadliest storm in North Carolina history. Newsline’s Galen Bacharier will report on how the state is preparing for this monumental task in terms of both scope and logistics.


Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.

Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Rhode Island’s first-in-the-nation state lawsuit against fossil fuel companies continues into its seventh year after surviving an attempt by one of the defendants to gut the state’s case on alleged procedural violations.
Rhode Island Associate Justice William E. Carnes in an April 22 decision rejected all of the arguments made by Chevron Corporation.
Chevron was one of 21 oil and gas companies sued for its role in exacerbating climate change in a landmark state climate change lawsuit brought by then-Attorney General Peter Kilmartin in 2018. The complaint seeks damages from fossil fuel companies on the assertion that for each company, “a substantial portion of fossil fuel products are or have been extracted, refined, transported, traded, distributed, marketed, promoted, manufactured, sold, and/or consumed in Rhode Island.” 
After years of appeals, concluding after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the case in April 2023, Chevron returned to state court seeking to have a portion of the case thrown out. The company contended the state failed to investigate or prove that any fossil fuel extraction, refinement or production occurred in Rhode Island, violating a clause of state court civil procedure known as Rule 11.
Attorneys for both sides made their case before Carnes in an April 16 hearing in Providence County Superior Court.
Carnes in his 15-page decision concluded there was no evidence of improper actions by the state — at least, not enough to meet the “high bar” of imposing penalties for Rule 11 violations.
“The Court must balance competing concerns when evaluating whether to issue sanctions because sanctions ‘can haunt an attorney throughout his or her career’ with ‘ramifications [that] go far beyond the particular case,’” Carnes wrote, quoting from a 2017 state Supreme Court decision reversing a lower court’s sanctions against an attorney in the case. 
Carnes’ rejection of Chevron’s pleadings does not signal an outcome on the overall decision in the case, including potentially awarding damages from fossil fuel companies. The next hearing in the case is slated for May 8, according to the public court docket.
Timothy Rondeau, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General, praised Carnes’ decision.
“We are grateful for Judge Carnes’ careful consideration, evaluation, and ultimate conclusion that the State acted properly,” Rondeau said in a statement Thursday. “We look forward to continuing to fight on behalf of Rhode Islanders and for environmental justice.”
‘And/or’
While legal precedent demands a specific standard to penalize attorneys for procedural violations, there is no formal court ruling or history on the use of “and/or,” another key part of Chevron’s legal arguments. Attorneys for Chevron insisted the state’s use of “and/or” in its original complaint meant it must prove that all of listed fossil fuel activities — manufacturing, refinement, sales and more — were performed by each company in Rhode Island. Attorneys for the state countered that the “and/or” caveat meant at least one, but not all, of the listed activities, could be proven.
Carnes’ conclusion?
“Rhode Island has not formally adopted any legal precedent around the use of ‘and/or,’ and, even if Rhode Island courts had done so, the State’s Complaint is not improper because the contested allegations are well grounded in fact based on the State’s interpretation of paragraph 21(g) and Chevron’s filings with the State of Rhode Island,” he wrote.
He also pushed back against Chevron’s citations from the websites of the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources and the U.S. Department of Energy, both of which said there is no oil production or refinement in Rhode Island. Carnes’ noted that the federal information was outdated — based on data from 2011 to 2014 — while the state website information does not specify if petroleum-based fuels were ever produced in Rhode Island, simply that they are not locally produced at present.
Other exhibits filed by attorneys for the state, including business filings with the Rhode Island Department of State, suggest Chevron and its subsidiaries have done sales business in Rhode Island as recently as 2024.
“It cannot be fairly said that the allegations which Chevron has moved to strike have no relation to the controversy because the State provided evidence that Chevron may have had Rhode Island manufacturing, refining, and other raw material activities,” Carnes wrote.
Carnes on April 16 ordered Chevron to hand over additional documentation regarding its business activity in Rhode Island. The company has 90 days to turn over evidence to the state for its case.
Judges in four other states, including New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and New York have tossed similar state, county or city-level challenges against fossil fuel companies. But dozens more remain under consideration in state-level courts across the country, including in Massachusetts. 
And in March, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the bid led by Republican state attorneys general that would have blocked these lawsuits from proceeding.
Theodore Boutrous, an attorney with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP in California representing Chevron, pointed to the dismissals in other state courts in a response Thursday to Carnes’ decision.
“As the New Jersey Superior Court held in dismissing New Jersey’s similar state lawsuit, ‘the leading and most persuasive case supporting dismissal is the Second Circuit decision in City of New York,’” Boutrous said in an emailed statement. “There, the federal appeals court rejected the availability of state tort law in the climate change context.”

The Trump administration is extending the deadline for states to submit their final proposals for a federal broadband program that’s still largely in the planning phase after more than three years (Spencer Platt/Getty Images).The Trump administration is extending the deadline for states to submit their final proposals for a federal broadband program, further delaying an effort that’s still largely in the planning phase after more than three years.
States will have an additional 90 days to submit their final plans for the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, a federal grant program meant to expand broadband access to underserved areas across the country.
The extension comes as the Trump administration prepares to make changes to the BEAD program, according to a notice from the U.S. Department of Commerce. The department is currently reviewing the program “to remove unnecessary rules and mandates, to improve efficiency, take a more technology-neutral approach, cut unnecessary red tape, and streamline deployment,” the notice said.
The $42.45 billion program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, began falling behind schedule in part because of inadequate federal mapping of where broadband is most needed and a lengthy challenge process to the maps. As a result, the slow-moving program has some local officials and experts questioning its efficiency.
They anticipate that federal officials might change an affordability requirement, which mandates states include a low-cost service option for low-income households, or the type of technologies given preference under the program. That shift likely would be away from fiber-optic internet toward satellites or other technology.
Earlier this month, more than 100 state lawmakers from 28 states sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick requesting that any changes to the BEAD program be optional rather than mandatory. They argued that mandatory changes could undo their BEAD plans and delay broadband deployment by a year or more.
The BEAD program originally had required states to submit their final proposals to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration within a year of their initial plan’s approval. Citing “extraordinary circumstances,” however — the new federal review — deadlines for states’ final proposals will be moved, according to the notice.
NTIA declined to comment for this story.
All 50 states have had their initial BEAD proposals approved, unlocking a portion — often 20% — of the money the feds will provide. As of April 14, Delaware, Louisiana and Nevada are the only states to have submitted their final proposals for public comment, according to the NTIA’s BEAD Progress Dashboard.
Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina and Texas are the only states that have not made any progress beyond having their initial proposal approved, according to the tracker.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)FBI agents arrested Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan on Friday, accusing her of obstructing an immigration enforcement action last week. 
Dugan was arrested at 8:30 a.m. at the county courthouse, according to the U.S. Marshal’s Service. She was scheduled to make an initial appearance in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Dries at 10:30 on Friday. According to a criminal complaint, she’s been charged with obstructing or impeding before a department or agency of the United States and concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest.
The agency’s director, Kash Patel, wrote on the social media platform X that Dugan had “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. In the now-deleted post, Patel accused Dugan of creating “increased danger to the public.” 
Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 for a pre-trial conference on charges of misdemeanor domestic battery. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents appeared outside Dugan’s courtroom, she led Flores-Ruiz and an attorney out a side door and down a private hallway. 
ICE agents later apprehended Flores-Ruiz on foot. This is the third time since March that immigration agents have appeared at the Milwaukee County courthouse to conduct arrests — a tactic that local officials have said threatens to undermine the work of the local justice system by making immigrants fearful of coming to the courthouse to testify in court. 
Dugan-Crim-complaint
In an initial statement, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said he was aware of Dugan’s arrest and that the legal process should be allowed to play out. 
“Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process,” Crowley said. “We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.”
But later, he accused the FBI of politicizing the arrest to punish perceived enemies.
“It is clear that the FBI is politicizing this situation to make an example of her and others across the country who oppose their attack on the judicial system and our nation’s immigration laws,” he said. “FBI Director Kash Patel issued a public statement on X, which he hurriedly deleted, making unsubstantiated claims about Judge Dugan’s case before charges were officially filed and she could have her moment in court. Director Patel’s statement shows that Trump’s FBI is more concerned about weaponizing federal law enforcement, punishing people without due process, and intimidating anyone who opposes those policies, than they are with seeking justice.”
U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said the administration of President Donald Trump is attacking democratic values.
“In the United States, we have a system of checks and balances and separations of power for damn good reasons,” she said. “The President’s administration arresting a sitting judge is a gravely serious and drastic move, and it threatens to breach those very separations of power. Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a Democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by. By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic Democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line. While details of this exact case remain minimal, this action fits into the deeply concerning pattern of this President’s lawless behavior and undermining courts and Congress’s checks on his power.”
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) said the arrest was “shocking.” 
“This Administration’s willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach,” Moore said. “Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require a high legal bar. I will be following this case closely and facts will come out, however, I am very alarmed at the increasingly lawless actions of the Trump Administration, and in particular ICE, who have been defying courts and acting with disregard for the Constitution.”
The ACLU of Wisconsin wrote on social media that ICE making arrests at courthouses interferes with the work of local justice officials.
“Judges have a duty to maintain order in their courtrooms and ensure the fair administration of justice, and federal law does not require state judges to act as agents of federal immigration enforcement,” the organization said. “Everyone is due their day in court, and when ICE starts showing up to courts looking to make arrests, it risks interfering with those rights. In recent weeks, the administration has attacked the integrity of our judicial system, refused to comply with a Supreme Court order, and arrested a judge for using her authority to protect the fair administration of justice.”

The agency’s director, Kash Patel, wrote on the social media platform X that Dugan had “intentionally misdirected federal agents away” from Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. In the now-deleted post, Patel accused Dugan of creating “increased danger to the public.” 
Flores-Ruiz appeared in Dugan’s courtroom on April 18 for a pre-trial conference on charges of misdemeanor domestic battery. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents appeared outside Dugan’s courtroom, she led Flores-Ruiz and an attorney out a side door and down a private hallway. 
ICE agents later apprehended Flores-Ruiz on foot. This is the third time since March that immigration agents have appeared at the Milwaukee County courthouse to conduct arrests — a tactic that local officials have said threatens to undermine the work of the local justice system by making immigrants fearful of coming to the courthouse to testify in court. 
Dugan-Crim-complaint
In a statement, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said he was aware of Dugan’s arrest and that the legal process should be allowed to play out. 
“Like any individual in this country, I believe she is entitled to due process,” Crowley said. “We should let the facts come to light and the legal process play out.”
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) said the arrest was “shocking.” 
“This Administration’s willingness to weaponize federal law enforcement is shocking and this arrest has all the hallmarks of overreach,” Moore said. “Federal law enforcement coming into a community and arresting a judge is a serious matter and would require a high legal bar. I will be following this case closely and facts will come out, however, I am very alarmed at the increasingly lawless actions of the Trump Administration, and in particular ICE, who have been defying courts and acting with disregard for the Constitution.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-25 15:40:18+00:00,CT Mirror,Some CT veterans fear federal changes will lead to health care cuts,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/25/ct-veterans-va-cuts-health-care/,The Trump administration says its VA staffing reductions won't impact the services veterans receive. But some vets say that's unrealistic.,"Connecticut veterans expressed fear and uncertainty this week about possible threats to health care access in the face of federal changes at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
In March, a leaked internal memo from the VA laid out plans to return the agency to its 2019 staffing levels, at which point it had just under 400,000 employees. According to a report last year, VA employs roughly 472,200 people, so meeting the Trump administration’s target would require slashing at least 70,000 jobs. 
“A big concern that I’m seeing across the entire veteran community is just lack of information. We’re not really being informed about what’s going on,” Emily Trudeau, a veteran and chair of the Connecticut Bar Association’s Veterans and Military section, said during a gathering of Connecticut veterans organized by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., in Meriden on Wednesday. 
The Trump administration has assured that the headcount reductions would focus on eliminating waste and would not impact the services veterans receive. In an opinion piece published in The Hill, VA Secretary Doug Collins said that while the department conducts its review, it will “continue to hire for more than 300,000 mission-critical positions to ensure health care and benefits for VA beneficiaries are not affected.”
JamesPeter Matthews, a member of the Army Reserves living in Winsted and chairman of legislative affairs for the CT VFW, expressed skepticism. 
“The Secretary of VA claims that a reduction of force within the VA will not reduce any services or resources for the VA to our veterans, their caretakers and families. That is an unrealistic statement,” Matthews said.

Peter Kasperowicz, press secretary for the VA, said in emailed comments that the agency would achieve savings without impacting services by maintaining “mission-essential jobs like doctors, nurses and claims processors, while phasing out non-mission essential roles like interior designers and DEI officers.” 
That savings would be “redirected to Veteran health care and benefits,” Kasperowicz added. “We will accomplish this without making cuts to health care or benefits to Veterans or VA beneficiaries.”
Several people in attendance at the event Thursday acknowledged that they had not yet experienced interruptions in their own care and said that Connecticut’s VA facilities are among the best in the nation. But there are existing challenges to accessing care, some said, which they worry could be exacerbated by broad staffing cuts. 
Matthews said he’d heard of Connecticut veterans facing long wait times and sometimes traveling as far as Long Island or Massachusetts for basic testing. None of the VA health facilities in Connecticut have a mammogram machine, for example, Trudeau said.
“There are a lot of concerns within the veteran community that efforts to expand into currently unaddressed areas of health care will have to be put on hold as the VA works to adapt and realign to maintain current services,” Trudeau said.
VA press secretary Kasperowicz confirmed VA Connecticut doesn’t offer mammography services, but added that it partners with community providers to “ensure Veterans receive these services at locations throughout the state.”
In January, President Trump announced a sweeping freeze on federal hiring, with some exceptions. Several VA positions were exempt, including doctors, mental health counselors, nurses and dentists. But last month, VA clinics and hospitals across the country reported that, despite the exemptions, issues with a government HR software program were creating hiring challenges.
While access in Connecticut remains largely uninterrupted thus far, Mike Cabrey, a retired veteran who served 30 years in active duty and lives in Hartford, said he’s starting to see cracks in the system.
Cabrey receives medical and behavioral health services at the VA. He said his counselor’s office hasn’t been able to rehire for an office position after someone left. As a result, his counselor has taken on added responsibilities, like restocking supplies, scheduling appointments and managing the front desk. 
“There’s a level of stress and anxiety that they’re dealing with,” Cabrey said of VA providers.
At the Wednesday event, Blumenthal said while there are undoubtedly opportunities to streamline VA operations, the current approach could upend access to care for veterans. 
“If there’s going to be elimination of waste, it has to be done thoughtfully, carefully,” Blumenthal said. “Not just slashing numbers of employees for the sake of saving a few dollars, which in the long-run, is going to cost more.”
The VA’s Kasperowicz responded directly to Blumenthal’s comments in his emailed statement. “Imagine how much better off Veterans would be if Sen. Blumenthal cared as much about fixing the department as he does about protecting its broken bureaucracy,” Kasperowicz wrote. 
“Unfortunately, many in the media, government union bosses and some in Congress are fighting to keep in place the broken status quo,” he added. “Our message to Veterans is simple: Despite major opposition from those who don’t want to change a thing at VA, we will reform the department to make it work better for Veterans, families, caregivers and survivors.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Blumenthal-roundtable-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-25 12:18:16.984341

Matt Bierlein (R-Vassar) speaks in support of legislation to ban nonconsensual “deepfake” pornography before a vote in the Michigan state House on April 24, 2025. | Photo: Anna Liz NicholsNearly every member of Michigan’s state House voted to approve bills Thursday to create criminal and civil penalties for creating or distributing fake sexual images or videos of real people using artificial intelligence to computer generate the materials.
The bill sponsors, Reps. Penelope Tsernoglou (D-East Lansing) and Matthew Bierlein (R-Vassar), implored lawmakers before the vote to recognize how sexual predators and extortionists are finding new ways to perpetuate violence as artificial intelligence technology advances.
“Unfortunately, bad actors are using these tools to create incredibly realistic fake images and videos, often involving explicit content without the consent or knowledge of the people portrayed,” Bierlein said. “These are not harmless pranks. They are deeply invasive violations that can destroy reputations, careers and mental health.’
Perpetrators can create hyper realistic “deepfake” pornographic materials that portray individuals the creators may have never met, stakeholders in sexual violence prevention told lawmakers in March as the bills were considered by the House Judiciary Committee.
Nonconsensual deepfake pornography is a relatively new problem facing the public, Tsernoglou said, noting that in the late 2010’s fake sexually sensitive images of female celebrities started being created. And since then, there have been instances where criminals have used artificial intelligence to humiliate, blackmail and abuse individuals, and at times drive them to suicide.
Michigan lawmakers consider bills to ban deepfake pornography

There’s a lot of debate about the merits and problems with artificial intelligence, Tsernoglou told lawmakers Thursday, but no one can deny that across industries, it has been used to analyze data quickly, automate tasks and supplement problem-solving for a human workforce, making it a powerful tool that isn’t going away any time soon.
“…artificial intelligence has only grown more and more powerful, and its impact on our society has only become more and more prevalent,” Tsernoglou said. “…we must stay hyper vigilant in our efforts to regulate the technology and to ensure that our most vulnerable community members are not exploited or harmed.”

The sole member of the House to vote against the legislation, Rep. Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers), has said in the past that he is supportive of elements of the package, but has concerns over individuals’ due process to be able to defend themselves if a case is brought against them. Carra proposed an amendment that would have allowed for defendants to argue that they had verbal consent from the individual portrayed in the sexual materials to create the materials, whereas the legislation excludes argument of verbal consent as an argument.
The legislation will now be up for consideration by the state Senate.

Democrats’ defiant news conferences
As the Trump administration takes a hatchet to federal programs, government workers have looked to the Legislature for a safe harbor.
Minnesota Democrats have been eager to answer that call, introducing a slew of tax and spending bills and offering a vision of St. Paul as a bulwark against the upheaval in Washington.
“We will fight to protect Minnesotans from the chaos, corruption and destruction from the Trump administration and federal Republicans,” said Sen. Erin Maye Quade, DFL-Apple Valley, at a news conference with several dozen other Democrats and activists on the Capitol steps on Thursday.
“We cannot accept the false trade-offs between education and health care, between public safety and the environment, between disability services and roads and bridges,” she said.
Democrats have bills to raise taxes on the top fifth of earners, corporations and luxury goods that could help offset Republican-proposed cuts to Medicaid. They have a bill to fund public health functions (for a yet unspecified amount), as federal cuts have led to layoffs in the state Department of Health. They have a bill to give $16 million to Minitex, a little-known library service facing significant federal budget cuts.
Earlier this month, Democrats held a news conference with federal workers to unveil bills that would extend unemployment benefits to those who accepted the “Fork in the Road” buy-out offer and give $10,000 to laid-off veterans who relocate to Minnesota. Both of those appear to have quickly stalled out.
Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, said Democrats are clear eyed that Minnesota can’t fix every problem created by federal cuts but need to show they’re trying to soften the blow.
“The alternative is to do nothing,” Greenman said. “We have to have ideas.”
(Two Senate Democrats — self-titled Blue Dogs — are an exception to the current aversion to talking about cuts with a proposal to reduce the benefits and taxes of the state’s new paid family leave law that launches Jan. 1.)
In the coming three weeks until the scheduled May 19 adjournment, defiant news conferences will turn into difficult closed-door negotiations as Democrats run up against the limits of their resources and power.
It’s an unfamiliar feeling: The last legislative session they controlled state government and a $17.5 billion surplus. Minnesota now faces a looming budget deficit and Republicans, who control half of the state House, say Democrats’ proposals are a fantasy.
They aim to use their new power to chip away at the sweeping progressive agenda Democrats passed in 2023-24 including unemployment benefits for hourly school workers, funding for light rail and subsidized health insurance for undocumented workers.
The Walz administration appears to be readying itself for deep cuts ahead. Minnesota Management and Budget, in negotiations with the union representing some 18,000 state employees, proposed creating an “emergency layoffs” process. That would allow the state to idle workers in the event of “fiscal exigencies” without having to follow the usual contractual procedures governing layoffs.
The relationship between the Walz administration and the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees union has soured since the governor ordered workers back to the office 50% of the time. MAPE leaders raised the prospect of a strike and compared Walz to Musk.
Walz didn’t invite them to his State of the State address this week.
Democrats float $1,200 bonuses for teachers
More than 70,000 licensed public and charter school teachers could receive $1,200 bonuses in the form of refundable tax credits under a bill pitched by Minnesota Democrats.
The bill (SF186) could help Minnesota schools struggling to attract and retain teachers, but the proposal must compete with a slew of other spending priorities as a gloomy budget forecast hangs over lawmakers crafting a two-year budget.
The credits would be expensive, estimated to cost about $100 million a year, but Walz has proposed sunsetting a program costing roughly $80 million a year that offers bonuses to school districts participating in the alternative teacher pay system known as Q Comp.
One of the competing spending priorities is helping school districts pay for unemployment benefits for school bus drivers and other hourly school workers. In 2023, Minnesota became the first in the nation to entitle school workers to unemployment benefits, which have long helped workers in construction and other seasonal jobs weather regular periods of unemployment.
Greenman, the bill author, told Axios Twin Cities that the benefit has achieved its goal and alleviated a shortage of bus drivers and other workers. But it has also cost school districts more than anticipated. Lawmakers gave school districts $135 million to cover the costs, which was supposed to last through June 2027, but the account only has enough to cover about half of what’s needed for this coming summer, Axios reported.
Walz and the DFL-led Senate have proposed allocating another $30 million to help school districts.
Democrats and SEIU, which represents unionized hourly school workers, scheduled a press conference on Friday to speak in support of keeping the unemployment benefits.
Minneapolis nursing home workers reach deal after strike

Around 80 nursing assistants, cooks, housekeepers and other workers at Providence Place nursing home in Minneapolis won 6% annual wage increases over the next two years after striking for two days last month.
A new nursing assistant will earn $21.48 per hour in 2025 and $22.56 per hour in 2026, in line with the average wage for nursing assistants across workplaces in Minnesota. The workers, who are unionized with SEIU Healthcare Minnesota & Iowa, also negotiated for 40 additional vacation hours and full benefits after their probationary period ends.
“We’re ready to take these gains and keep building towards our next bargaining in 2027 to win even more,” Amy Oliver, a Providence Place worker, said in a statement shared by the union.
Nursing home workers across the state are on track to receive significant pay increases under rules passed by the state’s new Nursing Home Workforce Standards Board, contingent upon funding from the state. By Jan. 1, 2027, certified nursing assistants in all nursing homes will earn at least $24 per hour under the rules approved last year.
Salary transparency may boost job applications
Twin Cities Business reports a new state law requiring employers to include salary ranges in job postings may be boosting the number of applications companies receive. Jenna Estlick of search firm Versique told the magazine that clients are seeing a “considerable” increase in job seekers since the law took effect Jan. 1.
That tracks with a number of other surveys showing job seekers are more likely to apply to postings when a salary range is included.
Minnesota is one of more than a dozen states that now require companies to disclose salary ranges, which proponents say can help reduce gender and racial pay gaps. It may also help current employees to negotiate for raises if open positions are advertised with higher salaries.
As of last year, Minnesota employers are also barred from asking job applicants about their current or previous pay in order to set compensation.
DOGE cuts cost billions
Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative could end up costing the government about as much as its de facto leader Elon Musk promised to save, the New York Times reported.
The Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that studies the federal workforce, estimates DOGE will cost taxpayers upward of $135 billion this year in lost productivity, paid leave and the cost of carrying out the tens of thousands of firings and re-hirings. Cuts to the Internal Revenue Service leading to about 22,000 employees leaving could cost $2.4 trillion over 10 years, according to The Budget Lab, if tax noncompliance is allowed to rise unchecked.
Neither of these estimates includes the substantial cost of defending DOGE’s cuts in court.
Compare that to the $150 billion Musk said DOGE is likely to save taxpayers, down from the $2 trillion he originally promised to save.
“Not only is Musk vastly overinflating the money he has saved, he is not accounting for the exponentially larger waste that he is creating,” Max Stier, chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, told the New York Times.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LEXINGTON — In front of a crowd that included the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees, state lawmakers discussed the ample opportunities to use artificial intelligence in Kentucky — particularly in areas of workforce development. 
The panel, held Thursday evening on campus, comes after the General Assembly passed initial legislation to regulate AI in state government with Senate Bill 4 earlier this year. The law, carried by Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, R-Lexington, sets standards for how state agencies can use AI and how to report that use to an oversight committee. The legislation had some bipartisan support and was signed by Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear in March. 
Some of the policies set forth in the law were discussed in last year’s legislative AI task force, chaired by Bledsoe and Rep. Josh Bray, R-Mount Vernon. In November, the group released 11 recommendations for AI policies the General Assembly debated during the 2025 legislative session. 
Most of the questions during the panel discussion focused on how AI could benefit Kentuckians in areas like health care, education and more. The panelists discussed a variety of possibilities, such as how AI could be used to automate scheduling doctor appointments for patients or giving students an AI tutor to assist them with learning. 
“We only just scratched the surface of really a few areas,” Bledsoe said of last year’s task force. “We left out some really key places.” 
Many of those discussions centered around how the state government can use AI ethically while also protecting the privacy and rights of Kentuckians, the senator said. After the panel, she told the Kentucky Lantern she hopes the task force is renewed by the General Assembly’s leadership for the interim session leading up to the 2026 legislative session beginning in January. 
“I think the biggest conversation that we didn’t get to have was centered around energy use policies and what data centers mean for, not only for Kentucky, but for artificial intelligence in general,” Bray said during the panel. 
Bray said that cheap energy resources are in demand across the country, and data centers needed to support AI technology “use a lot more energy than really any other sector or emerging industry, but there’s not a ton of jobs tied to it and to the data center itself, and so there’s a really large policy discussion and some decisions that have to be made around that.” 
After the panel, Bledsoe said discussions on AI and energy policy are “going to be critical” moving forward, along with figuring out land-use policies for AI data centers across the state. 
During last year’s task force, some conversations honed in on AI in areas like criminal law and election interference. SB 4 ultimately included that political candidates that have their speech or videos altered by AI can sue in court. 
Republican Secretary of State Michael Adams testified before the legislative task force, urging lawmakers to consider legislation that would make it a crime in Kentucky to impersonate an election official. His concerns at the time stemmed from a political consultant making fake robocalls to New Hampshire voters mimicking President Joe Biden ahead of the 2024 primary election encouraging them to not vote. 
Bledsoe said after the Thursday panel that some issues around AI and crimes are still being litigated in courts, meaning they could affect legislation passed before a judge renders a decision. Plus, Kentucky lawmakers are watching how laws passed in other states, especially those addressing AI in elections, are playing out. 
The task force also made a recommendation to urge the federal government to bolster AI regulations at the national level. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to promote AI education in K-12 schools, calling AI “the way to the future.” 
Bledsoe said if Congress passed a national framework for states on AI policies, that could avoid having a “patchwork” of different laws across the country. 
“We’re hoping that moves forward before we have to,” she said. “I think most states are waiting — are hoping — that moves forward.” 
As for the 2026 legislative session, Bledsoe hopes to reintroduce legislation she pulled this year that would have established rights for ownership of one’s likeness in images. She said the bill was “not quite where it needs to be” and faces complications in social media use.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3928-1024x741.jpg,,,2025-04-25 12:18:16.984341

The attacks on Judge John Barberis in the fall of 2016 appeared on his personal Facebook page. They impugned his ethics, criticized a recent ruling and branded him as a “politician” with the “LOWEST rating for a judge in Illinois.”
Barberis, a state court judge in an Illinois county across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, was presiding over a nasty legal battle for control over the Eagle Forum, the vaunted grassroots group founded by Phyllis Schlafly, matriarch of the anti-feminist movement. The case pitted Schlafly’s youngest daughter against three of her sons, almost like a Midwest version of the HBO program “Succession” (without the obscenities).
At the heart of the dispute — and the lead defendant in the case — was Ed Martin, a lawyer by training and a political operative by trade. In Missouri, where he was based, Martin was widely known as an irrepressible gadfly who trafficked in incendiary claims and trailed controversy wherever he went.
Today, he’s the interim U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., and one of the most prominent members of the Trump Justice Department.
In early 2015, Schlafly had selected Martin to succeed her as head of the Eagle Forum, a crowning moment in Martin’s career. Yet after just a year in charge, the group’s board fired Martin. Schlafly’s youngest daughter, Anne Schlafly Cori, and a majority of the Eagle Forum board filed a lawsuit to bar Martin from any association with the organization.
After Barberis dealt Martin a major setback in the case in October 2016, the attacks began. The Facebook user who posted them, Priscilla Gray, had worked in several roles for Schlafly but was not a party to the case, and her comments read like those of an aggrieved outsider.
Almost two years later, the truth emerged as Cori’s lawyers gathered evidence for her lawsuit: Behind the posts about the judge was none other than Martin.
ProPublica obtained previously unreported documents filed in the case that show Martin had bought a laptop for Gray and that she subsequently offered to “happily write something to attack this judge.” And when she did, Martin ghostwrote more posts for her to use and coached her on how to make her comments look more “organic.”
  Ed Martin exchanged emails with Priscilla Gray, who had worked in various roles for Phyllis Schlafly, about how to attack Judge John Barberis (Documents obtained, formatted and highlighted by ProPublica).
“That is not justice but a rigged system,” he urged her to write. “Shame on you and this broken legal system.”
“Call what he did unfair and rigged over and over,” Martin continued.
Martin even urged Gray to message the judge privately. “Go slow and steady,” he advised. “Make it organic.”
Gray appeared to take Martin’s advice. “Private messaging him that sweet line,” she wrote. It was not clear from the court record what, if anything, she wrote at that juncture.
Legal experts told ProPublica that Martin’s conduct in the Eagle Forum case was a clear violation of ethical norms and professional rules. Martin’s behavior, they said, was especially egregious because he was both a defendant in the case and a licensed attorney.
Martin appeared to be “deliberately interfering with a judicial proceeding with the intent to undermine the integrity of the outcome,” said Scott Cummings, a professor of legal ethics at UCLA School of Law. “That’s not OK.”
Martin did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Martin’s legal and political career is dotted with questions about his professional and ethical conduct. But for all his years in the spotlight, some of the most serious concerns about his conduct have remained in the shadows — buried in court filings, overlooked by the press or never reported at all.
His actions have led to more than $600,000 in legal settlements or judgments against Martin or his employers in a handful of cases. In the Eagle Forum lawsuit, another judge found him in civil contempt, citing his “willful disregard” of a court order, and a jury found him liable for defamation and false light against Cori.
Cori also tried to have Martin charged with criminal contempt for his role in orchestrating the posts about Barberis, but a judge declined to take up the request and said she could take the case to the county prosecutor. Cori said her attorney met with a detective; Martin was never charged.
Nonetheless, the emails unearthed by ProPublica were evidence that he had violated Missouri rules for lawyers, according to Kathleen Clark, a legal ethics expert and law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. She said lawyers are prohibited from trying to contact a judge outside of court in a case they are involved in, and they are barred from using a proxy to do something they are barred from doing themselves.
Such a track record might have derailed another lawyer’s career. Not so for Martin.
As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump vowed to use the Justice Department to reward his allies and seek retribution against his perceived enemies. Since taking office, Trump and his appointees have made good on those pledges, pardoning Jan. 6 rioters while targeting Democratic politicians, media critics and private law firms.
As one of its first personnel picks, the Trump administration chose Martin to be interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, one of the premier jobs for a federal prosecutor.
A wide array of former prosecutors, legal observers and others have raised questions about his qualifications for an office known for handling high-profile cases. Martin has no experience as a prosecutor. He has never taken a case to trial, according to his public disclosures.
As the acting leader of the largest U.S. attorney’s office in the country, he directs the work of hundreds of lawyers who appear in court on a vast array of subjects, including legal disputes arising out of Congress, national security matters, public corruption and civil rights, as well as homicides, drug trafficking and many other local crimes.
Over the last four years, the office prosecuted more than 1,500 people as part of the massive investigation into the violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. While Trump has pardoned the Jan. 6 defendants, Martin has taken action against the prosecutors who brought those cases. In just three months, he has overseen the dismissal of outstanding Jan. 6-related cases, fired more than a dozen prosecutors and opened an investigation into the charging decisions made in those riot cases.
Martin has also investigated Democratic lawmakers and members of the Biden family; forced out the chief of the criminal division after she refused to initiate an investigation desired by Trump appointees citing a lack of evidence, according to her resignation letter; threatened Georgetown University’s law school over its diversity, equity and inclusion policies; and vowed to investigate threats against Department of Government Efficiency employees or “chase” people in the federal government “discovered to have broken the law or even acted simply unethically.”
Martin “has butchered the position, effectively destroying it as a vehicle by which to pursue justice and turning it into a political arm of the current administration,” says an open letter signed by more than 100 former prosecutors who worked in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia under Democratic and Republican presidents.
Already, Martin has been the subject of at least fourdisciplinarycomplaints with the D.C. and Missouri bars, of which one was dismissed and the other three appear to be pending. Two of the complaints came after he moved to dismiss charges against a Jan. 6 rioter whom he had previously represented and for whom he was still listed as counsel of record. (The first complaint was dismissed after the D.C. bar’s disciplinary panel concluded that Martin had dismissed the case as a result of Trump’s pardons and so did not violate any rules.)
The third was filed in March by a group of Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. Senate. The fourth was submitted last week by a group of former Jan. 6 prosecutors and members of the conservative-leaning Society for the Rule of Law. It argues that Martin’s actions so far “threaten to undermine the integrity of the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the legal profession in the District of Columbia.” If Martin has responded to any of the complaints, those responses have not been made public.
Trump has nominated Martin to run the office permanently. Senate Democrats, meanwhile, have vowed to drag out Martin’s confirmation, demanding a hearing and setting up a fight over one of Trump’s most controversial nominees.










“I mean, he can get very hyper. He can get very emotional.”


– Jo Mannies, former political reporter at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch


Martin stepped off the elevator into the newsroom of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper. He was angry at a reporter named Jo Mannies, one of the city’s top political journalists. At a conference table with Mannies and her senior editors, he accused Mannies of being unethical and pressed the paper’s leadership to spike her stories about him, according to interviews.
Mannies said later she believed he was trying to get her fired.
“He was attacking her,” said Pam Maples, who was managing editor at the time. “He was implying she had an ax to grind, that she wanted to get some big story and that she was not being ethical. And when that didn’t get traction, it was more like ‘this isn’t a story.’ It wasn’t that he said anything about a fact being inaccurate, or he wanted to retract a story; he wanted the reporting to stop.”
Mannies had been covering a scandal dubbed “Memogate” that started to unfold in 2007 while Martin was chief of staff to Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt. In that role, Martin was using his government email to undermine Democratic rivals and rally anti-abortion groups. But when reporters requested emails from Blunt’s staff, the governor’s office denied they existed. Media organizations joined a lawsuit to preserve the messages and recover them from backup tapes.
An attorney for the governor, Scott Eckersley, later said in a deposition that Martin tried to block the release of government emails and told employees to delete their messages. After Eckersley warned that doing so might violate state law, he was fired. He sued the state for wrongful termination and defamation and settled for $500,000. Martin resigned as chief of staff in 2007 after just over a year on the job, and Blunt’s office would eventually hand over 22 boxes of internal emails.
In a 2008 email to the Associated Press, Martin dismissed Eckersley’s lawsuit as a “desperate attempt” to revise his story after he was fired, citing Eckersley’s own testimony that not all emails are public records.
The Memogate incident was telling — and Martin’s efforts to have Mannies fired were never reported. “His claim was we were misrepresenting what the law was and what he was doing,” she told ProPublica. “I mean, he can get very hyper. He can get very emotional.”
When Martin launched a bid for Congress in 2010, he acted as if Memogate was ancient history. He made himself available to Mannies, she recalled, always taking her calls. Years later, he even appeared, lighthearted and bantering, on a St. Louis Public Radio podcast Mannies co-hosted. She said Martin could be outlandish and aggressive, but he could also be disarmingly passionate about whatever cause he was pursuing at the moment, often speaking in a frenetic rush. “He just wore people down with his enthusiasm,” she said.
Martin allowed a different St. Louis reporter to shadow him during his 2010 run for Congress. The reporter asked about the St. Louis election board, a dysfunctional organization that, by all accounts, Martin had helped turn around in the mid-2000s. Martin had fired an employee there named Jeanne Bergfeld, and she later sued for wrongful termination. The board settled the lawsuit.
As part of the settlement, Martin agreed not to talk about the case and the board paid Bergfeld $55,000. Martin and two others issued a letter saying she had been a “conscientious and dedicated professional.”
But talking to the reporter covering his campaign, Martin said Bergfeld enjoyed “not having to do anything” and “wasn’t interested in changing.” The day after the story was published, Bergfeld sued Martin again, this time for violating the settlement agreement. Martin denied making the comments, but the Riverfront Times released audio that proved he had.
Martin agreed to pay Bergfeld another $15,000 but delayed signing the settlement for a few months. The judge then ordered Martin to pay some of her legal costs, citing his “obstinacy.”
Martin lost his 2010 congressional bid. He ran for Missouri attorney general two years later and lost again. After his stint as chair of the Missouri Republican Party, he went to work as Schlafly’s right-hand man. Martin grew so attached to Schlafly that a lawyer for the Eagle Forum jokingly called him “Ed Martin Schlafly.”
As the 2016 presidential campaign ramped up, Martin supported Trump even though Eagle Forum board members, including Cori, supported Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Cori described Trump at the time as an “egomaniacal dictator.” (Today, she said she supports him.) Cori and other board members were stunned when Schlafly endorsed Trump, with Martin standing by her side.
A few weeks later, a majority of the Eagle Forum’s board voted to oust Martin as president; a lawsuit filed by the board cited mismanagement and poor leadership and described his tenure as “deplorable.” Martin has maintained that he was Schlafly’s “hand-picked successor” and has characterized his removal as a hostile takeover.
“Every day, they are diminishing the reputation and value of Phyllis,” he said in a 2017 statement. She died in September 2016.
Cori and the board’s lawsuit sought to enforce Martin’s removal and demand an accounting of the forum’s assets. That’s the case that wound up before Barberis.
On top of his efforts to direct Gray’s posts on Barberis’ Facebook page, Martin prepared a separate statement, according to previously unreported records from the case. The statement called Barberis’ ruling to remove him as Eagle Forum president “judicial activism at its worst” that “shows what happens when the law is undermined by judges who think they can do whatever they want.”
Martin emailed the statement, which said it was from “Bruce Schlafly, M.D.” — the name of one of Schlafly’s sons — to himself, then sent it to two of her other sons, John and Andy, court filings show. Martin said the statement was a “declaration of war” and urged the Schlaflys to “put something like this out to our biggest list.” (It’s unclear if the message was ever sent.) Bruce Schlafly did not respond to requests for comment.
In a 2019 sworn deposition, Cori’s lawyer asked Martin questions about the posts on Barberis’ Facebook page and the letter he drafted for Bruce Schlafly. Because of the possibility that he could be charged with criminal contempt of court, Martin declined to comment, on the advice of his own lawyer, though he acknowledged that lawyers are barred from communicating with judges outside of court or engaging in conduct meant to disrupt proceedings.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Andy Schlafly, a lawyer and former Eagle Forum board member who supported Martin in the leadership fight, said “no court has ever sanctioned Ed for his engagement of First Amendment advocacy” and likened the controversy to liberal attacks on conservative judges.
He dismissed concerns about Martin directing Gray to contact the judge, saying she “speaks for herself” and had every right to voice her outrage. He compared Martin’s style — then and now — to Trump’s. He said he did not believe the email Martin drafted for his brother Bruce had ever been sent, but if it had been, it would have been no different from Trump posting on Truth Social, which he considered normal behavior in political battles.
“What would Trump do in that position?” Andy Schlafly said of Martin’s current role in Washington. “I would say Trump would be doing just what Ed’s doing. Elections do have consequences.”
Gray declined to comment. She was not part of the lawsuit.
When Cori’s lawyers uncovered the emails, they asked a new judge, David Dugan — who had taken over the case after Barberis was elected to a higher court — why Martin should not be held in criminal contempt for “an underhanded scheme” to “attack the integrity and authority” of the court with the Facebook comments about Barberis, according to court records.
Dugan declined to take up the criminal contempt motion. But he later found Martin and John Schlafly in civil contempt of court for having interfered with Eagle Forum after Barberis had removed them from the group. John Schlafly appealed the contempt finding and mostly lost. He did not respond to requests for comment. It’s unclear if Martin appealed.
Cori told ProPublica she also filed an ethics complaint against Martin with the Missouri Office of Chief Disciplinary Counsel, which investigates ethics complaints against lawyers. She said she was told her complaint would have to wait until her lawsuit concluded. The office said it could neither confirm nor deny it had received a complaint.
In 2022, when part of Cori’s lawsuit went to trial, a jury found Martin liable for defaming her and casting her in a false light — including by sharing a Facebook post suggesting that she should be charged with manslaughter for her mother’s death. It awarded her $57,000 in damages and also found Martin liable for $25,500 against another Eagle Forum board member.
Martin argued that the statute of limitations had expired on the defamation claims and that many of his statements were either true or vague hyperbole not subject to proof. He also claimed he could not be held liable because he didn’t write the offending post — he had merely shared something written by someone else.
In a post-trial motion, he also leaned into protections that make it harder for public figures to win defamation cases. Under that higher legal standard, it’s not enough for a plaintiff to show that a statement was false. Cori also had to prove that Martin knew it was false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth, and he said she didn’t prove it.
But while he’s wrapped himself in First Amendment protections when defending his own speech, he’s taken the opposite stance since being named interim U.S. attorney by Trump, threatening legal action against people when they criticize the administration.
For instance, after Rep. Robert Garcia called DOGE leader Elon Musk a “dick” and urged Democrats to “bring weapons” to a political fight, Martin sent Garcia a letter warning his comments could be seen as threats and demanding an explanation.
With the start of Trump’s first presidency, Martin and his family moved to the Northern Virginia suburbs near Washington, D.C. Martin had no formal role in the new administration, but he turned himself into one of the president’s most prolific and unfiltered surrogates.
CNN hired him in September 2017 to be a pro-Trump on-air commentator, only to fire him five months later after a string of controversial on-air remarks. He attacked a woman who had accused Alabama U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of molesting her as a child, praised Trump for denigrating Sen. Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas” and described some of his CNN co-panelists as “rabid feminists” and “Black racists.”

Unbowed, Martin went on to make more than 150 appearances on the Russia Today TV channel and Sputnik radio, both Russian state-owned media outlets, first reported by The Washington Post. On RT and Sputnik, Martin railed against the “Russia hoax,” criticized the DOJ investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller and questioned American support for Ukraine after Russia’s invasion by saying the U.S. was “wasting money in Kiev for Zelensky and his corrupt guys.”
The State Department would later say RT and Sputnik were “critical elements in Russia’s disinformation and propaganda ecosystem.” The Treasury Department sanctioned RT employees in 2024. The DOJ indicted two RT employees for conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to fail to register as foreign agents.
Martin’s flair for fealty set him apart even from fellow Trump supporters. He cheered the Maine Republican Party for considering whether to censure Sen. Susan Collins for her vote to convict Trump during the second impeachment trial. He singled out Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in a radio segment titled “America Needs to Go on a RINO Hunt.” He accused Sen. John Cornyn of going “soft” on gun rights after Cornyn endorsed a bipartisan gun-safety law after the Uvalde, Texas, mass shooting that left 19 children and two teachers dead.
On Jan. 6, 2021, Martin joined the throngs of Trump supporters who marched in protest of the 2020 election outcome. He compared the scene that day to a Mardi Gras celebration and later said the prosecution of Jan. 6 defendants was “an op” orchestrated by former Rep. Liz Cheney and law enforcement agencies to “damage Trump and Trumpism.”
During an appearance on Russia Today, Martin said then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi “weaponized” Congress’ response to the Jan. 6 riots by ramping up security on Capitol Hill, comparing her to the Nazis. “Not since the Reichstag fire that was engineered by the Nazis have we seen behavior like what Nancy Pelosi did,” he said.
As an attorney, he represented Jan. 6 defendants, helped raise money for their families and championed their cause. Last summer, Martin gave an award to a convicted Jan. 6 rioter named Timothy Hale-Cusanelli. According to court records, Hale-Cusanelli held “long-standing white supremacist and Nazi beliefs,” wore a “Hitler mustache” and allegedly told his co-workers that “Hitler should have finished the job.” (In court, Hale’s attorney said his client “makes no excuses for his derogatory language,” but the government’s description of him was “simply misleading.”)
After hugging and thanking Hale-Cusanelli at the ceremony, Martin told the audience that one of his goals was “to make sure that the world — and especially America — hears more from Tim Hale, because he’s extraordinary.”
In his three months as interim U.S. attorney for D.C., Martin has used his position to issue a series of threats. He’s vowed not to hire anyone affiliated with Georgetown Law unless the school drops any DEI policies. He vowed to Musk that he would “pursue any and all legal action against anyone who impedes your work or threatens your people.” He publicly told former special counsel Jack Smith and Smith’s lawyers to “[s]ave your receipts.” And in another open letter addressed to Musk and Musk’s deputy, Martin wrote that “if people are discovered to have broken the law or even acted simply unethically, we will investigate them and we will chase them to the end of the Earth to hold them accountable.”
More often than not, Martin’s threats have gone nowhere.
A month into the job, he announced “Operation Whirlwind,” an initiative to “hold accountable those who threaten” public officials, whether they’re DOGE workers or judges. One of the “most abhorrent examples” of such threats, he said, were Sen. Chuck Schumer’s 2020 remarks that conservative Supreme Court justices had “released the whirlwind” and would “pay the price” if they weakened abortion rights.
Even though Schumer walked back his incendiary comments the next day, Martin said he was investigating Schumer’s nearly 5-year-old remarks as part of Operation Whirlwind. Despite Martin’s bravado, the investigation went nowhere. No grand jury investigation was opened. No charges were filed. That the probe fizzled out came as little surprise. Legal experts said Schumer’s remarks, while ill advised, fell well short of criminal conduct.
In another instance, when one of Martin’s top deputies refused to open a criminal investigation into clean-energy grants issued by the Biden administration, Martin demanded the deputy’s resignation and advanced the investigation himself. When a subpoena arrived at one of the targeted environmental groups, Martin’s was the only name on it, according to documents obtained by ProPublica.
Kevin Flynn, a former federal prosecutor who served in the D.C. U.S. attorney’s office for 35 years, told ProPublica that he did not know of a single case in which the U.S. attorney was the sole authorizing official on a grand jury subpoena.
Flynn said he could think of only two reasons why this could happen: The matter was of “such extraordinary sensitivity” that the office’s leader took exclusive control over it, or no other supervisor or line prosecutor was willing to sign off on the subpoena “out of concern that it wasn’t legally or ethically appropriate.”
And when the dispute between the environmental groups and the Justice Department reached a courtroom, federal Judge Tanya Chutkan asked a DOJ lawyer defending the administration’s actions for any evidence of possible crimes or violations — evidence, in other words, that could have justified the probe initiated by Martin. The DOJ lawyer said he had none. “You can’t even tell me what the evidence of malfeasance is,” Chutkan said. “There are still rules that even the government has to follow, last I checked.”
Martin’s tenure has caused so much consternation that in early April, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., put a hold on Martin’s nomination. Typically, the Senate Judiciary Committee approves U.S. attorney picks by voice vote without a hearing. But in Martin’s case, all 10 Democrats on the committee have asked for a public hearing to debate the nomination, calling Martin “a nominee whose objectionable record merits heightened scrutiny by this Committee.”
Even the process of submitting the requisite paperwork for Senate confirmation has tripped him up. According to documents obtained by ProPublica, he has sent the Judiciary Committee three supplemental letters that correct omissions about his background. In an earlier submission, Martin did not disclose any of his appearances on Russian state-owned media. But just before The Washington Post reported that Martin had, in fact, made more than 150 such appearances, he sent yet another letter correcting his previous statements.
“I regret the errors and apologize for any inconvenience,” he wrote.

(Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.

The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.
In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”
In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.










I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.


– Buckley Brinkman, director of Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity


Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.
But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Leaning into pay and diversity, manufacturer expands amid workforce shortage

Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

In the 38-page filing, attorneys general for Arizona, Oregon, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota[...]","President Donald Trump speaking at the 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland, on Feb. 22, 2025. (Photo by Gage Skidmore/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0)A dozen Democratic attorneys general, led by the AGs in Arizona and Oregon, filed a lawsuit Wednesday arguing that President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs were illegally implemented and will cause irreparable harm to their constituents.
In the 38-page filing, attorneys general for Arizona, Oregon, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont urged the U.S. Court of International Trade to find that the president’s tariffs were issued illegally.
In the past three months, Trump has at various times declared and withdrawn the financial penalties on multiple countries. For now, the White House has settled on a 145% tariff on most products imported from China, 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods and 10% base tariffs on the rest of the world.
Another 57 countries were subject to “reciprocal” tariffs that were actually based on trade deficits, not existing tariffs that those countries had applied to American goods.
The attorneys general argued that the whiplash of constantly changing tariff rates has injected uncertainty into the country’s economy and said the president’s misuse of his strictly defined powers violates the U.S. Constitution.
“These edicts reflect a national trade policy that now hinges on the President’s whims rather than the sound exercise of his lawful authority,” reads the lawsuit. “By claiming the authority to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the United States he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the President has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy.”
Arizona AG Kris Mayes, who has mobilized her office to challenge the federal government’s actions in thirteen different lawsuits, called the tariffs “economically reckless” in a news conference announcing the latest lawsuit.
“As Arizona’s chief law enforcement officer, I will not stand by while the federal government imposes policies that harm our economy, violates the constitution and ignores the limits of executive power,” she said. “This lawsuit is about protecting Arizonans and businesses large and small, it is about defending our constitutional system and reminding this administration, yet again, that no one — not even the president of the United States — is above the law.”
The attorneys general argue that only Congress has the power to impose tariffs, and that Trump’s bid to circumvent that by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act is unlawful. The act, they wrote, makes no mention of tariffs, and only empowers the president to regulate, investigate or block trade while an investigation is ongoing.
And, they argue, the requirements for Trump to act during peacetime haven’t been met. The act grants the president the ability to regulate trade between the United States and other countries if there is an “unusual and extraordinary threat” that poses a risk to national security, foreign policy or the country’s economy.
To satisfy that, Trump has justified his tariffs by accusing Canada and Mexico of not doing enough to stop the flow of fentanyl and China of failing to intercept the chemical precursors that are used to manufacture fentanyl. And while Trump relied on IEEPA to greenlight 10% tariffs against the rest of the world, he provided no reasoning that might comply with the act’s requirements.
The lawsuit also notes that applying tariffs to every product from Canada, Mexico and China violates IEEPA, because not every product that is imported from those countries is related to the president’s purported goal of addressing the fentanyl crisis.
“The Plaintiff states agree that the fentanyl crisis requires urgent government action, but the imposition of tariffs is neither an effective nor a lawful response to that crisis,” the AGs wrote in the lawsuit. “The (tariff orders for China, Mexico and Canada) lacks any rationale for the tariff rates imposed and bears no relationship between the goods subject to the Order and the claimed emergency.”
During Wednesday’s news conference, Mayes highlighted the damage the tariffs risk causing to the Grand Canyon State’s business community and government agencies.
The Democrat, who previously served on the Arizona Corporation Commission, said she has discussed the possibility of increased rates with utility companies in the state, and while they haven’t committed to avoiding doing so, they also haven’t ruled them out. Mayes pointed out that some utility companies depend on lumber from Canada to erect telephone poles, and others use solar panels, which are largely made in China, or transformers, which come from Europe, China and South America.
Likewise, the Arizona Department of Transportation is already seeing prices rise, and Mayes said that will ultimately increase the cost of highway and road construction.
Bill Sandweg, the owner of Copper Star Coffee in central Phoenix, said that his business depends on ingredients that are grown in other countries, with climates that cannot be replicated in the United States, and specialty equipment that isn’t manufactured in the country. He said that he buys around $5,000 worth of spices from India every year, but the new tariffs have increased that cost to $7,500.
Sandweg called the tariffs “taxation without representation” and warned that, if they aren’t reduced, his costs will eventually be transferred to consumers.
This isn’t the first lawsuit the White House has had to contend with in the wake of its tariff policies. Last week, California launched its own legal challenge in federal court that similarly attacked the president’s use of his emergency powers to impose tariffs. And a Florida woman who owns a stationary business went to court to contest the fact that her voice, and those of other U.S. citizens, was ignored because the tariffs weren’t subject to congressional debate.
A group of small businesses also filed a lawsuit against Trump’s use of the IEEPA in the U.S. Court of International Trade on April 14. On Wednesday, a panel of judges overseeing the case decided against freezing the tariffs while litigation continues. A hearing is scheduled on May 13 for the court to consider the issue.

ANN ARBOR — A University of Michigan student accused of illegally voting in the 2024 election is facing a bench warrant after failing to appear in court for a hearing Thursday.
Haoxiang Gao, 20, a Chinese national, is facing two felony charges that he cast a ballot despite not being eligible and lied on the voter registration form. He was scheduled for a probable-cause hearing but didn’t appear. The hearing had been delayed repeatedly over the past several months.
It’s not clear where Gao is. K. Orlando Simón, Gao’s attorney and a staff member at the University of Michigan’s Student Legal Services, declined to comment Thursday, and university officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A voicemail left with the Washtenaw County prosecutor’s office Friday morning was not immediately returned.
The bench warrant, which authorizes an arrest, is an escalation in a case that has highlighted a loophole in the state’s same-day registration system, prompting lawmakers and state officials to propose new solutions to ensure it won’t happen again.
The decision, made by Judge J. Cedric Simpson of District 14A Court, happened after a bench conference with Gao’s lawyer.
If convicted, Gao could face up to nine years in prison and potential deportation.
Records obtained by Votebeat show Gao allegedly cast a ballot at an early voting center at the University of Michigan Museum of Art in Ann Arbor in October. Federal law restricts voting in U.S. elections to citizens, and authorities say Gao falsely claimed citizenship when registering.
In emails sent to local prosecutors and state election officials the day after the incident, Ann Arbor Clerk Jackie Beaudry said Gao admitted what he had done, after initially suggesting that someone else had used a green card to vote.
Cases like Gao’s are exceedingly rare. A statewide review in Michigan identified just 15 other suspected noncitizens who voted in the 2024 general election — roughly 0.00028% of all ballots cast.
That number closely matches the rate seen in other states. A 2024 review in Ohio found fewer than 600 of the 8 million people registered in the state were not citizens. In that instance, 138 of those people had potentially voted in the last year, officials said. A similar 2024 review in Georgia found that 20 of the more than 8.2 million people registered to vote there aren’t U.S. citizens. Only nine of those 20 had voted in previous elections, state officials said.
Michigan Republicans have seized on Gao’s case to call for stricter voting laws. Rep. Bryan Posthumus, a Republican from Rockford, introduced a potential constitutional amendment that would require new voters to prove their citizenship when registering in addition to requiring the state to run continual citizenship checks for voters already on the rolls.
Critics call the proposal a disproportionate response that could disenfranchise eligible voters, particularly those who may struggle to obtain documentation.
Supporters of the measure cited Gao’s case during a recent legislative hearing. Rep. Jay DeBoyer, a Republican from Clay Township, argued that “common sense election provisions” like citizenship checks would have prevented the incident.
Last week, members of the Board of State Canvassers unanimously approved language for the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights to gather signatures to get a nearly identical measure on the ballot through the petition process. The group, which has historically worked against ballot issues focused on the expansion of voting rights, has 180 days to gather nearly 450,000 valid signatures from registered voters around the state to get the proposal on the 2026 ballot.
Democrats have suggested they would introduce legislation that would stop noncitizen voting without requiring broad citizenship checks. Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who is running for Governor, said she would spearhead those efforts, but specifics of a plan have yet to be introduced.
Gao’s next hearing has not yet been scheduled, according to court records.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Legislative leadership approved a late bill on Thursday that would make the funding in the two-year budget for Medicaid available more immediately. 
Because the issue has already been through the legislative process, Speaker of the House Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) said the bill shouldn’t be referenced to a committee and instead should go straight to the Maine House of Representatives and Senate for votes. If it can secure two-thirds support, the funding would become available immediately upon the governor’s signature. 
Democrats pushed through a two-year budget in March without Republican support that continued government funding at the same level but also included one-time funding for some immediate needs, notably to fill a funding gap in MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program. Earlier, a change package to address that gap and other emergency measures in the current fiscal year failed after Senate Republicans refused to support it unless it included structural reform to the health care program.
Because the Democrats’ budget did not garner the two-thirds support needed for an emergency measure, the Legislature adjourned to start the clock to allow the funding to take effect in 90 days, which will be just before the start of the next fiscal year on July 1.
This has left some health care providers in a bind until then. 
When the budget passed, several hospitals said they were not in a position to absorb the payment cuts they’re seeing as a result of the funding delay. On March 12, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services started capping payments owed to health care providers in an attempt to ensure some level of funding was available for the duration of the current fiscal year.
Rep. James Dill (D-Old Town), who sponsored the new proposal, underscored these concerns when presenting his bill to the Legislative Council on Thursday. 
“There are major concerns not only that some of the smaller ones may close down because of the lack of MaineCare funding,” Dill said, “but even if they don’t close down, that some of my constituents will lose their jobs even of the greater concern, not only could they lose their jobs leading to unemployment, etc., they could lose their health insurance.”
Members of the Legislative Council voted 6-2 to allow in the late bill, with the assistant minority leaders, Matt Harrington of York in the Senate and Katrina Smith of Palermo in the House, opposed. Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart of Aroostook and House Majority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor were absent. 
This bill is among a handful the Legislative Council has approved past cloture, the deadline for submitting legislation to the Revisor’s Office, which was Jan. 10.
Some of these late bills specifically aim to provide support in light of recent federal funding cuts. 
On Thursday, the council approved a late bill as a vehicle to address the possibility that the Maine Sea Grant Program within the University of Maine System may not be fully reinstated. The vote was also 6-2, with Harrington and Smith opposed.
On. Feb. 28, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notified University of Maine that it was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, which helps finance statewide research, strengthened coastal communities and supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades. 
While one of 34 such grants, Maine’s was the only one terminated, a decision that came about a week after President Donald Trump threatened to withhold funding from the state for not complying with his executive order barring transgender students from competing in women’s sports. After outcry from Maine’s congressional delegation, NOAA announced it will be renegotiating the grant. 
“It remains unclear at this time whether the Maine Sea Grant will be fully reinstated,” said Rep. Holly Stover (D-Boothbay), the bill sponsor. “The loss of the Maine Sea Grant will have devastating consequences to our fisheries, coastal communities and economies statewide.”
Every federal dollar spent on the Sea Grant results in $15 of economic activity in the state, amounting to a total annual impact of $23.5 million.
In February, the Legislative Council also approved a measure to help farmers secure low interest loans to backfill commitments after the Trump administration froze funding for existing contracts.
Among other bills deemed non-emergencies, the Legislative Council voted against allowing any late submissions for joint resolutions to Congress, with Fecteau and Senate President Daughtry (D-Brunswick) arguing they would consume more time and resources than is available for the remainder of the special session. 
“There’s a lot of work that still needs to be done,” Fecteau said, “and I generally don’t think the Congress listens to us, frankly.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Saint Paul is a mess these days. 
Hannibal Buress once joked about St. Paul at a Turf Club show by saying, “fraternal twins,” i.e., there’s Minneapolis and then its runtier, sleepier, duller twin. 
We’ve lost our only grocery store downtown, which is looking like a modern day Dickens novel since the pandemic. Most of the downtown real estate is owned by a zombie outfit called Madison Equities, whose neglect of its own buildings has eroded downtown property values. 
A failed rent control policy hamstrung development that might have increased housing options and bring more life — and taxpayers — to the city. Our dysfunctional city government — featuring a council that struggles to make it to their own meetings — had to declare an emergency just to get the trash picked up. 
No doubt you’ve driven the roads of our glittering state capital, so you know what that’s like. 
We also have the highest sales tax in the state and among the highest property taxes. 
But you know what we don’t have much of anymore? Shootings. 
We’ve had just two homicides this year, compared to eight last year at this time, and neither from gunfire. 
The Pioneer Press’ Mara Gottfried has been covering this remarkable story. 
One key to this success is that St. Paul police are solving non-fatal shootings. 
St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry credits Mayor Melvin Carter — whose father was among St. Paul’s first Black police officers — with asking this question: 
“How is it that the clearance rate for murders — when ‘your best witness is dead’ — is so much better than cases where there is a surviving witness?”
This question has bothered me for more than a decade, when I wrote about a different police department’s lackadaisical attitude toward non-fatal shootings.
More recently, Reformer reporters tracked the problem in 2021 in Minnesota and particularly Minneapolis, with this headline: “If you shoot someone, you’ll probably get away with it.” 
Think about it: The perpetrator of a non-fatal shooting is a wannabe murderer who is a bad shot, so why are we allowing so many of them — 90% in some communities — to roam free, especially when shootings often set off multiple rounds of violent retribution? 
Carter also delivered resources, which allowed SPPD to devote nine officers to investigating non-fatal shootings. 
What do you know: The clearance rate on non-fatals shot up, from 27% to 71% between 2022 and 2024, Gottfried reports. And as the risk of getting caught has gone up, the shootings have declined: As of early April, eight people had beeen injured in shootings, compared to 26 at the same time last year.  
Once you take the failed murderers off the street, you see a sharp reduction in murders. 
The city also created the Office of Neighborhood Safety and Project PEACE, which they credit with employing what we might call soft power to dissuade specific at-risk young people from going down the wrong path.   
Collective safety is the first responsibility of government, and St. Paul is making progress on this front. (Minneapolis has also made strides.) 
Consider how this reduction in violence will change lives, families, entire neighborhoods. 
Imagine what it’s like to go to bed without hearing gunshots, or living without the fear that your kids will catch a stray bullet or get caught up in a cycle of retributive violence. 
This governing success has other important implications. 
Some people will always believe crime hysteria, but many fair-minded Minnesotans will happily visit the cities or even move here if they know it’s safe. 
The Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party is dominant in the cities, which means that urban governance plays an outsized role in how the party is perceived everywhere else. If the cities are plagued by gunfire, the DFL will own it, and it will drag down the brand, such as it is. 
Although the Minnesota DFL held their urban margins in 2024, Democrats in other major cities across the country lost ground in the face of urban disorder, including among Black and immigrant voters. 
If the cities can reduce gun violence, however, undecided Minnesotans may find new confidence in the DFL’s ability to solve problems. 
This is why it’s so important for local and state elected officials to prioritize tangible problems that can be solved with proven, local solutions. 
A counterexample: St. Paul could spend a billion dollars and have no measurable impact on climate change. 
But we can make the city safer and more vibrant. 
So, congrats, St. Paul. 
Let’s start a bonfire in the parking lot of the abandoned CVS on Snelling and have a party.

Tate Reeves signed a bill into law Thursday to limit kratom purchases to people 21 and older and outlaw more potent forms of the herbal substance in Mississippi.,"Gov. Tate Reeves signed a bill into law Thursday to limit kratom purchases to people 21 and older and outlaw more potent forms of the herbal substance in Mississippi. 
The law will take effect July 1.
House Bill 1077, authored by Rep. Lee Yancey, a Republican from Brandon, institutes fines for people under 21 who buy or possess kratom and retailers that sell it to them. 
It also bans synthetic kratom extracts, or products that contain high concentrations of 7-hydroxymitragynine, one of the chemical components in kratom that binds to the same receptors in the brain as opioids. Kratom extracts are considered more dangerous than “pure” forms of the herbal substance because of their higher potency. 
The bill protects children and makes kratom safer in Mississippi, but could have gone further to entirely ban the substance, said Yancey. 
“There are some people who depend on it who are trying to get off of other opioids,” he said. “This is something that might be a step down from that and I would hope at some point they could get off of this as well.”

Rep. Lee Yancey
Any ordinances that have been adopted by municipalities or counties to regulate or ban kratom will remain in effect, and municipalities will have the option of instituting local restrictions on sales of kratom in the future. 
More than thirty counties and cities in Mississippi already restrict or ban kratom products at the local level. 
Critics of kratom, which can be found widely in gas stations and tobacco or vape shops, argue that it is a highly addictive and dangerous drug that produces stimulant- and opioid-like effects. But advocates argue it is an effective tool for treating opioid use disorder, chronic pain and depression. 
House Bill 1077 was one of four proposed by Legislators this year to regulate kratom. A bill in the Senate authored by Sen. Angela Turner-Ford, D-West Point, sought to schedule synthetic kratom extracts as a controlled substance, but died in the House. Two other proposals in the House died after they were not brought up for a floor vote.  
Dr. Jennifer Bryan, the president of the Mississippi Medical Association, urged lawmakers to schedule all forms of kratom – pure and synthetic – as a controlled substance at a House Drug Policy hearing at the Capitol Jan. 28, calling kratom “the next phase of the opioid crisis.” 
State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney also spoke in support of criminalizing the drug given its highly addictive qualities.  
But kratom advocates argue it has significant health benefits and that criminalizing the drug would be dangerous for people who depend on it for pain management or to satisfy drug cravings, and could create a dangerous underground market for the substance. 
Christina Dent is the founder and president of End It For Good, a nonprofit advocating for a shift away from a criminal justice approach to drug use. The group has advocated against banning kratom outright, though Dent said she supports age restrictions and banning synthetic kratom.
“We need to respond in a way that acknowledges the potential risk and sets regulations around that but does not just push it into the free-for-all of an underground market,” she said.  
Legislators have tried unsuccessfully to pass legislation regulating the sale of kratom in recent sessions. The House passed a bill in 2022 to make kratom a Schedule I drug and a bill in 2023 to ban kratom extracts, but both died in the Senate.
“It feels good to get something done on kratom,” Yancey said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12115238/3X0A0121.jpg,,,2025-04-25 11:10:14.848156

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to hear a GOP appeal in a pivotal Pennsylvania election law case, the state Democratic party and the Democratic National Committee argued in a court filing Friday.
The Republican National Committee and the Republican Party of Pennsylvania asked the high court in January to hear their appeal of a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision on provisional ballots issued days before last year’s presidential election.
In a 4-3 decision, the state’s highest court affirmed voters’ rights in the commonwealth to cast provisional ballots and have them counted, if they learn their mail-in ballots have been rejected.
In a brief opposing the GOP’s petition, the state Democratic Party and the DNC argue the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is the ultimate authority in the case. Granting the appeal would set a precedent invalidating state supreme court jurisdiction in election law cases across the country.
“Granting certiorari here would almost surely engender requests for this Court’s review of any and every state-law election case, burdening the Court with invitations to weigh in on all manner of (often time-sensitive) state-election-law disputes,” Democratic party lawyers argue. “That is not a regime the Court should foster.”
The case is Republican National Committee, et al. v. Faith Genser, et al. 
Four days before the Nov. 5 election, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the RNC’s request for an emergency stay against the state Supreme Court ruling. Justice Samuel Alito said the court declined the request “because it would not impose any binding obligation on any of the Pennsylvania officials who are responsible for the conduct of this year’s election.”
Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairperson Sharif Street said in a statement the DNC is fighting to ensure Pennsylvanians have their votes counted.
“Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to game the vote in their favor and that’s why they’re trying to upend Pennsylvania’s sovereignty and end a long-standing voting practice in the state,” Street said. “With important Pennsylvania elections in November and in 2026, Democrats aren’t taking anything to chance when it comes to winning back the state.”
DNC Chairperson Ken Martin said “Pennsylvanians deserve to have their votes counted in every election – full stop. Simple errors on mail-in ballots shouldn’t impede Pennsylvanians from exercising their rights at the ballot box.”
Lawyers for the RNC and Republican Party of Pennsylvania did not immediately return calls Friday.
The underlying case involves two Butler County voters who were told their mail-in ballots had been rejected because they neglected to seal them inside secrecy envelopes before returning them. The voters went to their polling places for the primary  in 2024 and voted by provisional ballot.
The Butler County Board of Elections, however, told the voters that their provisional ballots would not be counted. Represented by the Public Interest Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, the voters challenged the board’s decision and won favorable decisions in Commonwealth Court and the state Supreme Court.
In an opinion for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court majority, Justice Christine Donohue wrote that the Butler County Board of Elections correctly rejected the voters’ mail-in ballots because they did not comply with the Election Code’s requirement to use a plain envelope to ensure the anonymity of ballots. 
But Donohue said the county board erred by refusing to count provisional ballots the voters cast at their polling places after learning their mail ballots were fatally flawed. The Election Code requires county elections officials to count provisional ballots if no other ballot is attributable to the voter and provided there are no issues that would disqualify the provisional ballot, the court’s majority found.
In its petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, the GOP argues the state Supreme Court usurped the Pennsylvania Legislature’s authority to set the “times, places and manner” for congressional elections, leaning on a premise known as the “independent state legislature theory.” That theory asserts that the U.S. Constitution reserves the authority to set the times, places and manner of elections exclusively for state legislatures.
In opposition, the DNC and Pennsylvania Democratic Party assert that the U.S. Supreme Court lacks jurisdiction, because the case falls outside the limited circumstances in which it can review the judgment of a state’s highest court. Such appeals are allowed only when a federal law is in question, a state law is claimed to conflict with federal law or “where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution.”
The GOP is not challenging the validity of any federal or state law, the Democratic brief says. “Far from it, petitioners seek federal-court enforcement of a state statute — as they, rather than the state’s highest court, interpret it,” the Democratic party argues.
And the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that a petitioner may claim a constitutional right only for itself and not a third party, the party said.
“Petitioners — the Butler County Board of Elections, the Republican National Committee, and the Republican Party of Pennsylvania — cannot claim any right or privilege for themselves under the Elections or Electors Clauses,” the Democratic brief says.
The U.S. Supreme Court also lacks jurisdiction, the brief says, because the GOP did not raise its claim about the state legislature’s sole authority over federal elections until the case got to the state Supreme Court, which ruled that the claim had been waived.
In the brief, the DNC and Pennsylvania Democratic Party argue that there are no conflicting court decisions on the question of counting provisional ballots. It also refutes the GOP claim the Pennsylvania Supreme Court “exceeded the bounds of ordinary judicial review,” with its ruling.
By providing a response to a question about the meaning and intent of a state law in a case duly raised by the litigants on its normal appellate docket, the brief says, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was “quite literally” just doing its “job.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/scotus_sunsetariana-figueroa_states-newsroom.jpg,,,2025-04-25 10:05:10.132786

The Mississippi Today internships provide aspiring journalists the opportunity to work in a Pulitzer Prize-winning newsroom, and learn a multitude of skills that will prepare them for a career in mission-driven, public service journalism.
This summer, Mississippi Today is offering two distinct intern positions. 
The Video intern will work with Mississippi Today’s Audience Engagement team to produce social vertical video content and traditional long-form videos. Areas of focus may include filming, editing, graphics, storyboarding and social media distribution.
The Special Projects intern will work with Mississippi Today’s experienced reporters and editors on large, comprehensive projects in the fields of Health, Politics and Justice. Areas of focus may include data crunching, submitting records requests, graphics creation, reporting and writing
“These internships are designed to be as immersive as possible,” says Managing Editor Michael Guidry. “Our interns get to work alongside experienced editors and journalists, contributing to the enterprise reporting Mississippi Today has become trusted to deliver.”
Among past interns are Alex Rozier, Simeon Gates and Richard Lake. Rozier has been Mississippi Today’s data and environmental reporter since 2017. Gates was a 2024 reporting intern and now serves as the newsroom’s general assignment reporter. Lake joined Mississippi Today in 2024 as its Audience Engagement Specialist.
“Mississippi Today’s internship threw me right into the mix of local reporting, something that was hard for me to find just coming out of college,” Rozier said. “At a lot of other journalism internships, you get stuck doing data entry or transcribing interviews. But here I was immediately getting assigned stories to do by myself. Even though I was new to the state and much greener than my colleagues, I felt treated like an actual reporter, and like I was actually needed to fill holes in our reporting.”
“My Mississippi Today intern experience elevated my skills and professional development in ways that still impact my day to day in my current role,” added Lake. “Utilizing interns as actual team members that are enabled to handle impactful projects, alongside the best journalists in this state, is what sets this opportunity apart from others.”
The paid, 10-week internship runs June 9 through August 8. Candidates interested in the video internship can apply here. Those interested in the reporting internship can apply here. Deadline to apply is Friday, May 9. Additional questions? Contact HR Director Dylan Penny at dpenny@deepsouthtoday.org.",,,,2025-04-25 10:05:10.132786

(Photo by Yehyun Kim/CT Mirror)Legislators are looking to delay raises for most state workers as Connecticut braces for big cuts in federal aid. But early indications are those pay hikes — whenever they arrive — will be healthy, costing the state more than $120 million per year.
Gov. Ned Lamont and the union representing nearly 900 state police troopers recently struck a tentative deal that grants a 2.5% cost-of-living increase next July 1. All but senior troopers also are eligible for a step increase that adds about 2 more percentage points to the raise.
Those proposed raises for troopers, which legislators will be asked to ratify later this spring, offer indications of the pay hikes to come for the state’s more than 40,000 other unionized employees.
In other words, how would Connecticut convince arbiters it can’t afford 4.5% raises for engineers, social workers, IT professionals, custodians and others — once it had granted such increases to troopers?
The prospect of new raises topping 4% for all workers is already polarizing legislative leaders this week.
Majority Democrats say the state workforce is badly understaffed and that many agencies struggle to recruit or retain employees. But Republicans ask why the administration, which anticipates Congress will slash hundreds of millions or even billions in aid to Connecticut and its municipalities, is poised to dole out raises that exceed those offered most private-sector workers.
 GOP leaders: Democrats exaggerate CT budget crisis

“Clearly they [Democrats] are just playing a shell game,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. “They continue to beat the drum there are phantom cuts coming” from Washington.
In recent days, Democratic-controlled committees have proposed legally exceeding the state spending cap next fiscal year; redirecting $700 million from a savings program to reduce pension debt to instead off-set impending cuts from Washington; and boosting taxes on businesses and high-earning households.
“I think we have to be extremely careful with the [wage] contracts that are presented before us,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield. “Keep in mind the taxpayer.”
“For weeks, lawmakers have claimed that massive federal cuts are looming, using fear as a tool to justify breaking Connecticut’s bipartisan fiscal guardrails,” said Carol Platt Liebau, president of the Yankee Institute, a conservative fiscal policy group. “Yet they’ve made no effort to reduce state spending and instead proposed a budget that blows past our spending cap.”
Both Harding and Candelora praised the important work done by state troopers but said legislators should be looking to freeze wages for all state employees before adopting the measures proposed in committee.
The Lamont administration estimates the troopers’ raises would cost $6.3 million next fiscal year, a tiny share of an overall state budget expected to approach or exceed $27 billion. But if all workers get similar raises, the overall cost approaches $130 million, based on past estimates from state analysts.
Asking workers to forgo raises one year wouldn’t be too painful, Candelora added, given the healthy increases they’ve received in recent years.
The legislature ratified a four-year contract with the troopers union in 2023 that set compensation for the first three years and stipulated a reopener to set wages for the 2025-26 fiscal year.
The Lamont administration estimated when that original contract was presented that the average salary for troopers would increase by 9.7% in the first year, 3% in the second and 4.8% in the third.
Most state employee unions have received 2.5% general wage hikes and a step increase for each of the past four fiscal years.
 Democratic leaders: CT is struggling to maintain its workforce

Democrats say the issue is more complex than that.
The Executive Branch workforce shrank 10% between 2011 and 2018 as then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and the legislature often used attrition and hiring freezes to close budget deficits.
The Lamont administration has struggled to attract and retain workers because Malloy significantly scaled back pension and other retirement benefits for new hires through concessions agreements with unions in 2011 and 2017.
More than 4,400 veteran state employees retired between Jan. 1 and June 30, 2022 — roughly double the total normally seen in a full year — just before certain restrictions on pension benefits tied to the 2017 concessions package took effect.
The state police contract ratified in 2023 was specifically designed to boost compensation to stem a trooper recruitment crisis.
“The Republicans pay lip service to supporting law enforcement, except where it really counts,” said Senate President Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, predicted some rank-and-file Republican legislators would support the new raises proposed for troopers.
“It will not be their entire caucus voting ‘no,’” the speaker said. “No chance.”
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, said “municipalities regularly give raises above and beyond what state employees get,” further complicating efforts to retain workers.
Osten also noted that state government spending on overtime has increasingly been criticized but reflects inadequate staffing in “24-7” agencies such as the state police force and the Department of Correction. Osten is a retired correction officer supervisor and former president of the correction supervisors union.
According to the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis, agencies and departments spent more than $158 million on overtime through the first six months of this fiscal year — about $6.7 million, or 4.4%, more than they had through the first half of the prior year.
The State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, which represents all major state employee bargaining units excluding the troopers’ union, wrote in a statement that the state police suffer from “severe understaffing.”
The force stood at roughly 1,100 one decade ago when the troopers union battled Malloy in court because a statute directing a minimum level of 1,248 troopers was not being followed.
The SEBAC statement added that “recognizing the need to provide fair wages and working conditions is an important step forward towards protecting the vital public services upon which our communities depend.”
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said the administration “appreciates the difficult and essential work done by the men and women of the Connecticut State Police. This wage reopener continues the current wage increase pattern for their bargaining unit.”
The president of the Connecticut State Police Union, Todd Fedigan, could not be reached Thursday for comment.
According to the details of the wage agreement the Lamont administration filed Wednesday with the General Assembly, the state police union ratified the deal on April 14.

Here's how much you need to live comfortably.","Connecticut’s average salaries are among the highest of the nation, but so is the cost of living.
Connecticut residents’ average salaries are the eighth-highest in the nation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. When adjusted for the high cost of living (Connecticut is the 11th-most expensive state to live in), Connecticut’s average salary becomes the ninth-highest in the United States because the dollar doesn’t stretch as far here.
Connecticut’s cost of living is calculated by dividing the state’s average wages by the cost of living index. The World Population Review sets the national average at 100 as a base to calculate the differences between states. The cost of living takes into consideration the amount of money needed for food, shelter, transportation and health care.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average hourly wage in Connecticut is $36.56, with an annual mean salary of $76,050, behind states like Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey.
But when adjusted for the cost of living, the salaries in Connecticut are reduced to the equivalent of $32.56 an hour, or $67,720.39 annually, because the dollar doesn’t go as far. When the salaries of all states are adjusted for cost of living, Connecticut comes in above Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey but trails states including Minnesota, Virginia and Texas.
So, how much money do you need to live comfortably in Connecticut? Depends on how you define it.
According to MIT’s living wage calculator, the living wage represents the hourly rate an individual must earn while working full-time, around 2,080 hours per year, to support themselves and their family. 
Taking into consideration average spending in food, accommodation, transportation, medical and other expenses, the study shows that the minimum wage does not cover the cost of living in Connecticut.
The living wage would be the amount of money necessary to cover all expenses and taxes. For a family with two children and two working adults in Connecticut, each adult should earn about $73,000 to meet the living wage standard, according to the report.
In the case of one adult living alone, the minimum wage in Connecticut is 1.5 times lower than the living necessary to pay all of the average expenses. In the case of two adults with two children, the living wage necessary to maintain the family is about two times higher than the minimum wage. 
If a person decides to follow the 50/30/20 budgeting rule, allocating 50% of income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings or debt repayment, SmartAsset calculated that Connecticut ranks as the third-most expensive state for raising a family and the 11th state with the highest salary needed to live comfortably.
With this methodology, a single adult in Connecticut would need approximately $100,380 annually to meet the comfort threshold, while a two-parent household with children would require a combined income of $279,884, one of the highest in the country.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-23-at-2.38.11 PM-1024x515.png,,,2025-04-25 10:05:10.132786

(Photo by Bhaamati Borkhetaria/CW Beacon)To the frustration of environmentalists who argue that states must take stronger action on climate in the absence of federal leadership, Massachusetts last week postponed enforcement of a rule requiring truck manufacturers to sell a minimum percentage of electric vehicles by two years.
Representatives for the trucking industry applauded the move, arguing there isn’t enough demand or infrastructure to support electric trucks. But, environmental advocates said that the state’s decision will set Massachusetts back in its climate goals and prolong exposure to harmful emissions for the state’s residents.
“We’re very disappointed to see the state of Massachusetts, which is really considered a leader on climate, kowtowing to truck manufacturers in this instance,” said Emily Green, a senior attorney at the Conservation Law Foundation who works on climate change, clean energy, and transportation. “The transportation sector is a huge contributor of greenhouse gas emissions in Massachusetts, and delaying enforcement of this regulation will make it all the more difficult for Massachusetts to comply with its binding climate limits.”
The Advanced Clean Trucks rule requires that manufacturers of medium and heavy-duty trucks sell an increasing percentage of zero-emission vehicles year over year starting in 2025, the year the state was to begin enforcing fines. Starting this year, Massachusetts would have required 7% of trucks and tractors sold in the state to be electric vehicles. (Pickup trucks are not included in the requirements.) The percentages must increase each year until more than half of the trucks sold in the state are electric.
Massachusetts adopted California’s vehicle emission standards, which are more strict than federal regulations, in 1990.
Massachusetts announced on April 14 that it will not enforce percentage requirements for the model years 2025 and 2026 as long as manufacturers, who have been withholding diesel trucks unless dealers agree to buy a certain amount of electric trucks, supply trucks to dealerships in the state without restrictions.
“Some manufacturers are limiting…truck sales as a means to ensure their compliance with ACT sales requirements, reducing availability to a wide range of users,” said a memo from the state’s Department of Environmental Protection. “Further, the current federal administration has created significant uncertainty around [zero-emission vehicle] incentives, charging investments, manufacturing, and tariffs, each of which threatens a smooth transition to medium- and heavy-duty ZEVs.”
The nation’s leading truck manufacturers provided input when California developed the rule and agreed to meet the requirements. But now, they are arguing that the industry will not be able to meet the requirements because of high costs and a lack of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
Kevin Weeks, executive director of the Trucking Association of Massachusetts, applauded the Healey administration’s decision to delay the rule.
“Even if the manufacturers could provide the trucks, nobody would buy the trucks because you can’t charge the trucks,” said Weeks. “[They have] range issues, battery issues, cost issues, and on and on. It’s just not feasible for people to purchase medium and heavy-duty trucks that are electric at this point.”
But, Green and other environmental advocates say that holding the line on climate policy at the state level has become more important as the Trump administration attempts to roll back key environmental protections designed to transition the country off of fossil fuels.
“At a time when the federal administration is shirking its responsibilities with respect to environment and climate and environmental justice and health and air pollution, it’s more important than ever that states hold their ground and not over-comply and not bend to the will of the Trump administration until they are forced to do so,” said Green.
Currently, the Trump administration is working on “reconsidering” the clean trucks rule along with two other emissions waivers that Massachusetts has also adopted: the Heavy-duty Omnibus Regulation, which requires manufacturers to sell lower emissions engines for heavy-duty vehicles like trucks, and the Advanced Clean Cars II Regulation, which has a goal of reaching 100% zero-emissions vehicle sales by 2035.
“This is a moment where the states should stand up to the federal government rather than doing their work for them,” said Anna Vanderspek, the electric vehicle program director at Green Energy Consumers Alliance. “Let’s force the federal government to go through the [rollback] process, which will likely end up in the courts, so that we don’t weaken the Clean Air Act and its provisions for them.”
Late last year, Massachusetts delayed enforcement of the Heavy-duty Omnibus rule for the model year 2025 and pushed enforcement back to 2026.
Vehicle emissions from trucks have an outsize impact on public health, according to public health experts. An October analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists showed that the delay in enforcing the Advanced Clean Trucks rule to 2027 will lead to a cost of somewhere between $97.2 and $127.8 million in health impacts from things like emergency room visits and school days lost to asthma in Massachusetts.
The transportation sector accounts for the largest amount of greenhouse gas emissions – about 40%– in Massachusetts. Medium and heavy-duty trucks and buses make up about 7% of the state’s registered vehicles, but contribute a disproportionate 46% of nitrogen oxide, 40% of fine particulate matter, and 20% of global warming emissions, according to a 2021 analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Doug Brugge, the head of the public health sciences department at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, said vehicle emissions from trucks that run on fossil fuels lead to many different adverse health outcomes, including respiratory ailments, cardiovascular conditions, and neurological harm.
“Airborne particulate matter is probably the most common and the most serious environmental health concern that we know of, especially for people who live near busy roadways or major highways,” said Brugge. “They will have elevated exposure to these particles. Lower-income, racial or ethnic minorit[ies], and immigrant communities tend to be in areas where these exposures are higher.”
Massachusetts’s move to delay enforcement on Advanced Clean Trucks has environmentalists worried that other states will follow its example, and the benefits of the rule will be kicked back by two years.
Initially, the Healey administration refused to back down and said the rule would go into effect on Jan. 1, 2025, but there was heavy pushback from the trucking industry. State and local agencies faced difficulties in purchasing new vehicles for snowplowing, snow removal, street sweeping, storm response, and other essential uses.
Some flexibility was built into the Advanced Clean Trucks rule through a system of credits to help with compliance. There are ways that manufacturers can get credits for “early-action” before 2025, swap credits with other businesses, or carry forward deficits for up to three years.
“The government is investing to support this market, and there are clearly scores of models of these vehicles that are working in the field today and are working really well,” said Jason Mathers, the associate vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund. “It is illogical to think that the trucking manufacturers and dealers are so incompetent as to not be able to structure deals with customers who want to purchase these vehicles.”
Mathers said that the minimum percentage of 7% or 11% is very achievable with the infrastructure and the technology that currently exists.
Rules like Advanced Clean Trucks set the trajectory of the transportation sector market in the state, and delays inject uncertainty into the electric vehicle market, according to Green.
“Even if they continue to plow ahead with other supportive things, there will be something missing in terms of not [enforcing] this rule” for another two years, said Green. “They’re also…bending to the demands of the truck manufacturers and giving power over to the industry, which is not a great look. This will result in there being less zero-emission vehicles on the road at least in the short term.”

The WNBA is a tough league to make, with few roster spots available each season. Going abroad presents myriad challenges and life upheaval. Then there’s wear and tear on the body and demands upon your time.
But really, for the Drake player who has starred as much in the classroom as she did on the basketball court, the answer was really quite simple.
“I’m a nerd,” Dinnebier said.
Dinnebier has been among the nation’s top mid-major players the past two seasons and last week was named a first-team academic all-American.
With that success, agents and WNBA teams had reached out to her, but Dinnebier went another direction. Instead of pursuing a pro career, she opted to stay in school to continue her pharmacy studies at Drake. She is finishing the fourth year of her six-year Doctor of Pharmacy program at Drake.
Basketball might have its Dr. J, but in two years the pharmacy world will have its Dr. Dinnebier.
“It was a really hard decision because I do love basketball,” she said. “It would have been really cool to hear my name on draft day or to get an invite to training camp. That’s something that a lot of people don’t get to say they did.”
That was the thing most people told her. Katie, just do it. Katie, just give it a try. Katie, you can say you did it. Katie, at least go to training camp.
As the deadline loomed to declare for the WNBA draft held April 14, Dinnebier searched her nerdy soul and made official what she sensed all along: She was staying put.
“Deep down, I knew I didn’t want to go,” she said. “Ultimately, I love school.”
At this time of the year, sports news is full of stories about the transfer portal: who is leaving, who is landing where and who is deciding to go pro. That’s why Dinnebier’s decision is so noteworthy and offers some fans a sliver of hope that the concept of student-athlete still exists.
Because they do exist. With a 3.74 GPA, Dinnebier was a first-team all-Missouri Valley Conference scholar-athlete. She was the only one on the first team who didn’t have a perfect 4.0. That includes teammate Anna Miller, who plans to go to medical school. Teammate Courtney Becker, a pharmacy major with a 3.87 GPA, was on the second team.
On the basketball side alone, Dinnebier was the conference’s player of the year. If anyone else had gotten that award, it would have been Katelyn Young of Murray State. She was also on the MVC scholar-athlete first team with a 4.0 GPA.

Parents optimistic, but even college sports is a stretch
Sports fans are familiar with the commercial that gets shown frequently during March Madness, the one in which the NCAA touts that most of its athletes are going pro in something other than sports. For a lot of the things the NCAA has screwed up in the past decade (or more), that is the truth. The question for the athletes is if that fact is a blessing or a cold slap of reality.
Journalist Melissa Jacobs has an excellent Substack called Good Game, in which she writes about youth sports. In a recent post, she offered details of a parent survey that said 22.2% of parents believed their child could play top-level college sports and 22.7% believed their child could play lower-level college sports. In addition, 11.4% believe their child can have a professional sports career.
The reality, Jacob says, is that 1% to 4% of youth athletes make it to college sports, depending on the sport. And a shot at the pros is but a fraction of that.
So while the college scholarship student-athletes get can pale in value to the money a school can cash in because of these players (which is why the Name, Image and Likeness deals came along), it’s still an opportunity. And it’s an opportunity – and a challenge – sports fans can forget is still there for players on their favorite teams because the big NIL bucks aren’t for everyone.
“Those rigors are real,” Drake Coach Allison Pohlman said. “We talk a lot about how glamorous it is that our team has a very high GPA, and they do really, really well. Well, they also work at it. They’re putting in the hours.”
Dinnebier, already no slouch at the school thing, got a wake-up call in her first class of the current semester. She had already been told that this was the hardest semester of her program, but was a little shocked to hear the professor tell students they should set aside 55 hours a week for pharmacy school this spring.
“I kind of looked at the guy and thought, ‘Fifty-five hours a week? I wouldn’t have enough time if I was a normal student, let alone on top of a basketball schedule. Are you nuts?’
“But I think that’s where we are blessed as athletes, because we do learn to time-manage at a very young age. You kind of get used to blocking off time to study.”
She figured it out, juggling those requirements while averaging 23.4 points a game for the Bulldogs and finishing second in the nation in assists with 7.2 per game.
Fifty-five hours of studying and Division I basketball? No biggie, as it turns out.
“I love to study. My de-stresser is studying,” she said. “My coaches, my teammates, will all make fun of me because I am the biggest nerd.”

Pohlman saw the nerd in action more than a few times, and not on the basketball court.
“There would be a lot of times when I’d be the first one typically to the gym, but Katie would be there in our locker room in front of the whiteboard, and there’s just hundreds of, whether it’s vocabulary terms or equations, things that she has written up that she’s sitting there studying.”
Pohlman said teammate Becker, also a pharmacy major, took a whiteboard with her on road trips to do the same thing while Miller often would be the first one up in the morning on road trips, sitting in the hotel lobby studying.
The pharmacy program has been home to a few successful Drake players. Tricia Wakely, the MVC player of the year in 1996, and Kiersten Miller, the MVC player of the year in 1998, were both pharmacy majors, as was Laura Leonard, who calls Drake and MVC games on ESPN+.
Academic opportunities help schools recruit athletes
Leaning into a school’s academic specialties is part of recruiting, and it helps when a school has a niche program that can help winnow the field. (I once asked former Michigan State Coach Karen Langeland if it was her coaching style that explained why so many of her former players were police officers; she laughed and said no, it was the draw of the school’s criminal justice program.)
“Those are the fun ones,” Pohlman said. “Knowing what it is that they’re looking for and what their overall goals are and then being able to puzzle it all together and match it up. That stuff is fun.”
Making that match is something even powerhouse programs have to do sometimes. When South Carolina Coach Dawn Staley recruited Joyce Edwards, the homegrown superstar wasn’t that interested in playing for the three-time national champions. The school didn’t have an environmental engineering major and that’s what the player who had a 5.0 GPA in high school wanted.
So Staley spent time with the university’s academic program leaders to understand how Edwards could, through the school’s honors program, create her own major to pursue a degree in environmental engineering. Edwards then accepted South Carolina’s scholarship offer and was one of the nation’s top freshman players this season, when the Gamecocks were the national runner-up.
Academics were always part of Dinnebier’s plan. Though she was Miss Iowa Basketball in high school and led Waukee to the 2021 state championship, a pro career was never on her mind. But a strong senior season that capped four impressive years at Drake got the attention of agents and WNBA team reps, and suddenly there was an option Dinnebier had never considered.
That made watching the WNBA Draft last week a little surreal. She knew for sure her name would never be called because she had, essentially, told the league – and basketball – “Nah, I’m good.”
“It would have been nice to see my name up there,” she said. “But it was also such a relief. Like, ‘Oh I don’t have to stress about this.’”
Instead, she’ll enjoy Drake Relays week, not worry about spring practice and focus on an internship at Wellmark this summer. She’s uncertain just which direction her pharmacy career will take; rotations later in the program will help her decide.
Since Dinnebier will still be on campus, she might be a practice player for the Bulldogs and continue to work at summer basketball camps.
“I’ll be around. I’ll be at games. I’m excited to be their biggest cheerleader in the stands,” she said. “It’s definitely going to be a different perspective. But yeah, I’m excited. I love this place.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)With school funding still uncertain, and less than a month to go in the Alaska legislative session, the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday advanced a reworked bill that would increase the base of the state’s funding formula by $700 per student. 
Members of the committee also included some policy proposals suggested by Gov. Mike Dunleavy last week. Members of the committee said it’s an effort to compromise with the governor after he vetoed a larger education funding bill last week. 
The committee passed House Bill 57 after amending it on Thursday to allow charter school planners to apply for approval at any time of year, require school districts to simplify processes for charter renewals, and establish a new state task force on education funding. It would also direct the Department of Labor and Workforce Development to gather data on students post-graduation. 
Dunleavy has signaled a hard line in the education policy changes he favors as a precondition for increasing the base student allocation, core of the state’s per-pupil funding formula. 
Dunleavy’s office declined to comment on the added policies and amended bill that passed the committee, saying, “the governor’s statement issued yesterday still stands.”
Dunleavy shared a statement on social media on Wednesday criticizing the bill as lacking policies that he wants. “We agree that more money is needed, but without policy, we won’t see better outcomes. Policy that ensures reading gains, expanded enrollment options, and true accountability is essential. Reforms need to be in the bill for my support,” he said. 
But lawmakers see the reworked bill as a step in negotiations and finding a compromise.
“This proposal isn’t the final word, but it’s a serious step toward addressing the challenges in our education system. It reflects a willingness to engage, to put forward ideas, and to keep moving the conversation toward meaningful solutions,” said Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, in a statement announcing the amended bill. “We may not all agree on every piece, but we all recognize the need to act — and this bill is part of that ongoing effort.”
The amended bill also calls for a 10% increase to per-pupil transportation funding, which Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel, and co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said was “essential.” 
“We need to get this funding into classrooms now — our students can’t wait,” he said. 
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage and chair of the Senate Rules Committee, said the plan is for the bill to be introduced to the full Senate on Friday, with amendments and a final vote on Monday.
From there, it would go to the House for approval.

One of the fiercest legislative fights of 2019 was over a bill limiting the amount that many California landlords can hike rent.
Six years later, legislators were back at it again as the Assembly’s housing committee took up a bill Thursday, authored by Democratic Assemblymember Ash Kalra of San Jose, which would: 

Reduce the cap from 10% to 5% (or 2% plus the current inflation rate, whichever is lower);
Extend the law to single-family homes (currently exempt);
Make the law permanent (current law sunsets in 2030).

If crowd size at a mid-morning weekday committee hearing is any indication, Assembly Bill 1157 is among the most contentious bills of the year. Advocates on both sides crowded into the hearing room and blocked the hallway outside in color-coded droves. Tenant advocates with the nonprofit Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment sported yellow; landlords allied with the California Apartment Association made up a sea of red. 
Supporters of the bill argue that the current statutory cap is far too high for low-income renters, especially given the punishing inflation of the last few years, and that the carve-out for single-family homes is unfair.

Tammy Alvarado, a San Diego County renter and bill proponent: “Most people’s American dream is to buy a house and ours is just to remain in our house. Unless something changes, becoming homeless is a reality for my family.”

The bill passed the committee, but narrowly, 7 to 5.
Many Democrats, particularly in the Assembly, have trained their legislative focus this year on making it easier, cheaper and more enticing to build new housing. Even some of the lawmakers who voted for the bill Thursday did so half-heartedly, lamenting the cooling effect the policy might have on the construction of new homes at a time when the state is desperate for more overall supply.
As with current law, the bill would not apply to homes that are 15 years old or newer. Most economists agree that rent control measures do tend to discourage the construction of new homes and the upkeep of old ones, while providing financial stability to long-time renters. And as with any policy, the details matter.
The tension between supply boosters and skeptics is likely to become a dominant theme in this year’s legislative session. On Monday, a major housing production bill stalled and another only barely skated by in the Senate Housing Committee, when the chairperson called the bills’ lack of hardcoded affordability requirements a “non-starter.” 
Two days later, over in the Assembly, Speaker Robert Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, issued his list of priority housing legislation. Notably, AB 1157 did not make the cut.

San Mateo could make history


San Mateo County Sheriff Christina Corpus enters a San Mateo County Board of Supervisors meeting in Redwood City on Nov. 13, 2024. Photo by Nhat V. Meyer, Bay Area News Group




Last month, voters in San Mateo County overwhelmingly approved a measure to grant its board of supervisors the authority to remove the county sheriff by a four-fifths vote. 
This result, as CalMatters’ Nigel Duara explains, follows a gripping saga that includes a 408-page report, commissioned by the county, which accuses San Mateo County Sheriff Christina Corpus of nepotism and conflicting relationships. 
After being elected to office in 2022, Corpus appointed one of her campaign consultants, Victor Aenlle, to the executive director of administration. But Aenlle’s relationship with Corpus was more than a “mere friendship,” according to the November report by a retired Santa Clara superior court judge, and included a trip to Hawaii and lavish gifts. During this time Corpus made at least four requests to raise Aenlle’s salary. One was granted, raising his pay to $246,979. 
Aenelle told CalMatters the claims are “fabricated,” and that there is a campaign to remove Corpus from office because she threatened the overtime pay that deputies were expecting. 
The San Mateo County Executive is suing the embattled county sheriff, who is refusing to resign, and Corpus is suing the county. If the board is successful at removing her — a process expected to take at least three months — it would be the first time in California’s history a county sheriff is removed from office.

Cities, law enforcement force concession on homelessness bill

From CalMatters homelessness reporter Marisa Kendall:
State Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez’s effort to stop cities from arresting homeless people for camping in public places fell flat this week in the face of opposition from cities and law enforcement agencies. 
With visible tears, the Democrat from Pasadena opted to cut the most controversial part of her bill.

Pérez: “I understand that cities still want the ability to be able to provide clean communities for residents. But at the same time, we need to recognize that these are people with humanity, too.”

Pérez agreed to amend Senate Bill 634 to instead prohibit cities from punishing outreach workers for providing aid to unhoused people (Fremont recently criminalized “aiding” and “abetting” homeless camps, but later walked back that language). The bill also would prevent cities from passing ordinances that ban shelters and supportive housing (as Norwalk did last year).
San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie was among those who opposed Pérez’s effort to limit how cities crack down on homeless camps. The original bill “threatens the city’s progress” on homelessness and would make it difficult to connect people to services, he said in a letter read aloud by a representative during the hearing.

Zikmund served in World War II and later opened his medical practice in Central City, Nebraska. (Courtesy of Creighton University)OMAHA — Creighton University has announced a $10 million scholarship gift that can be used to financially support a variety of students regardless of study discipline or program area. 
A media statement this week from Creighton officials described the gift as one of the largest ever made to support “unrestricted” scholarships not limited to a particular field or income level.
The funds come from the estates of alumnus Dr. Elno Zikmund and his wife, Tillie. He died in 2022 and she passed away the next year.
They expand the Elno T. and Mathilda M. Zikmund Endowed Scholarship, which was created in 2010. Its 80 recipients so far represent a variety of professions, ranging from budding physicians to accountants and ministers. 
“With the wide-ranging support of the Zikmund Scholarship, students from many different fields are taking Creighton’s values into their communities, as Dr. Zikmund did,” said the Rev. Daniel Hendrickson, president of Creighton. 
The family’s gift continues a university legacy that started nearly 90 years ago when Elno Zikmund’s mother, Omaha nurse Hattie Zikmund, paid for her son’s Creighton education, the statement said. Though Zikmund went on to acquire his medical degree elsewhere, he attributed his formation as a person and success as a physician to his time at Creighton.
After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Zikmund practiced medicine in Central City. He retired there at age 65 and moved to Omaha. Zikmund and his first wife, Janaan Zikmund, who died in 1962, had four sons.
Admirers noted a framed copy of Zikmund’s favorite poem, “Desiderata” by Max Ehrmann, that hung in his medical office. They said he lived by the words, among them: 
“Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story.”

Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.Connecticut’s attorney general has sent his second warning in a month to the low-cost carrier Avelo Airlines, telling the startup it has jeopardized tax breaks and other local support by agreeing to conduct deportation flights for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Democrats in the Connecticut legislature, meanwhile, are working to expand the state’s sanctuary law to penalize companies like Avelo for working with federal immigration authorities.The backlash comes after Texas-based Avelo signed an agreement early this month to dedicate three of its 20 planes to carrying out deportation flights as part of the charter network known as ICE Air. It also follows a report by ProPublica, which Connecticut Attorney General William Tong cited in an April 8 letter to Avelo, revealing flight attendants’ unease over the treatment and safety of detainees on such flights. The concerns airline staffers raised included how difficult it could be to evacuate people wearing wrist and ankle shackles.“Can Avelo confirm that it will never operate flights while non-violent passengers are in shackles, handcuffs, waist chains and/or leg irons?” Tong’s April 8 letter asks. “Can Avelo confirm that it will never operate a flight without a safe and timely evacuation strategy for all passengers?”Tong then issued a public statement on April 15 reiterating his concerns.In an April 3 email to Avelo employees obtained by ProPublica and other publications, CEO Andrew Levy called the deportation contract “too valuable not to pursue” at a time when his startup was losing money and consumer confidence was declining, leading Americans to take fewer trips. Avelo would close one of its bases, in Sonoma County, California, and move certain flight routes to off-peak days as resources shifted to ICE Air. Deportation flights would be based out of Mesa, Arizona, and would begin in May.Avelo has a major hub in New Haven, Connecticut, and it recently expanded to Bradley International Airport near Hartford. In 2023, the airline won a two-year fuel-tax moratorium from state lawmakers after extensive lobbying.Last Thursday, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal was among the nearly 300 attendees at a rally outside the New Haven airport. “Avelo has to change its course,” he said. “To the president of Avelo: You really stepped in it.”Members of the public are raising objections as well. An online petition calling for a boycott of Avelo unless it drops its new ICE contract has collected almost 35,000 signatures since April 6. And protests are spreading from Connecticut to cities the airline serves across the country, including Eugene, Oregon; Rochester, New York; Burbank, California; and Wilmington, Delaware.Tong’s letter to Avelo demanded that the airline produce a copy of its ICE Air contract. The attorney general also asked if Avelo would deport people in defiance of court orders, pointing to March flights to El Salvador carried out by another charter airline, GlobalX, after a federal judge ordered that the planes be turned back. Neither ICE nor GlobalX responded to ProPublica’s requests for comment.Levy answered Tong with a one-page letter. In it, Levy suggested that if Connecticut wanted more information about Avelo’s ICE Air contract, it should file a public records request. (Federal statistics show that such requests to ICE typically take months or years to be answered.)If the attorney general wanted to know more about the use of shackles on deportation flights, Levy continued, he should ask the Department of Homeland Security. If Tong wanted to know more about evacuation requirements, he should address questions to the Federal Aviation Administration. For Avelo’s part, Levy assured Tong, the airline “remains committed to public safety and the rule of law.”“Regardless of the administration or party affiliation,” an Avelo spokesperson told ProPublica in an emailed statement, “when our country calls our practice is to say yes. We follow all protocols from DHS and FAA.”A Democrat-sponsored bill to expand Connecticut’s sanctuary law has now cleared its House Judiciary Committee in a 29-12, party-line vote, over the strong objections of Republicans, and awaits a full vote on the floor. If it passes, any companies — including airlines — proposing to do business with the state must pledge not to “cooperate or contract with any federal immigration authority for purposes of the detention, holding or transportation of an individual.”Meanwhile, Avelo’s fuel-tax moratorium expires on June 30. So far, no legislation has been introduced to extend it, and activists are urging Connecticut lawmakers to let the tax break die.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SRR_Avelo-protest040925_2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-25 09:00:26.891334

Or maybe it was the urinating puppy. Or perhaps it was the $1,200 boots. 
San Mateo County Sheriff Christina Corpus is facing removal by the Board of Supervisors after a cascade of allegations — some scandalous, some concerning, some just plain odd — portrayed a chaotic picture of her two years and three months in office.
After a county investigator found Corpus violated policies on nepotism and conflicting relationships, voters empowered the supervisors to remove her, a three-month process slated to begin at the end of April. If successful, it would be the first removal of a county sheriff in California history.
Six cities in San Mateo County have called for her resignation. The county executive is suing Corpus. Corpus is suing the county. Taxpayers are probably picking up the tab for all of it. At stake is the administration of law enforcement in one of the wealthiest enclaves in the country.
Corpus’ road to professional peril began when the sheriff’s captain decided to run for her boss’s job in 2022. 
Her opponent, then-Sheriff Carlos Bolanos, had his years in office bookended by scandal. In 2007, when he was the undersheriff of San Mateo County, he and former Sheriff Greg Munks were briefly detained by police in a raid at a Las Vegas brothel. The raids were dubbed “Operation Dollhouse.” Five people were arrested, but Munks and Bolanos were not among them. 
Munks said at the time that he believed the brothel was a legitimate massage business. Bolanos could not be reached by CalMatters for comment. 
Fifteen years later, in one of his final acts in 2022, Bolanos sent four sheriff’s office employees to Indiana to raid a production facility that makes $210,000 Batmobiles, complete with flamethrowers to simulate the superhero vehicle’s jet turbine exhaust. The reason: A constituent complained that his car delivery had been delayed over a missed payment. Attorney General Rob Bonta declined to investigate Bolanos. 
Corpus ran as a reformer and promised changes.
Bonta endorsed Bolanos and the incumbent held a significant early polling advantage, but Corpus won the 2022 nonpartisan open primary anyway with 57% of the vote. Candidates who receive more than 50% of an open, top-two primary vote are declared the winners without the need for a general election. 
“We stood up to an establishment,” Corpus said on the night of her primary victory, “and it’s been amazing.”
A contemporaneous account of her election night watch party in the local Redwood City Pulse said Corpus’ supporters presented her with a large custom bottle of champagne emblazoned with her name, the year and the sheriff’s office logo. 
Beneath that were the words: “A sheriff we can trust.” 
Before everything that followed – the arrest of the deputies’ union president; a damning, 400-page outside investigation; the sheriff’s divorce and whispers about her personal conduct – this was one of the first and last highlights of Corpus’ early tenure. 
When the sheriff-elect was thanking her volunteers, she called out four by name. One of them was local activist Nancy Goodban.
“A lot of us activists were her best volunteers, because we wanted a reform sheriff,” Goodban said. 
So what transformed Goodban from one of Corpus’ top supporters to someone who attends board meetings just to call for her removal? 
“Oh,” Goodban said. “When that report came out.”

Hiring an ally kicked off firestorm
The trouble started, according to a November report commissioned by the county, when Corpus named one of her campaign consultants to a position in the Sheriff’s Department, executive director of administration.
Retired Santa Clara Superior Court Judge LaDoris Cordell’s report described the campaign consultant, Victor Aenlle, as “someone who has far more experience as a Coldwell Banker associate real estate broker than he has in law enforcement.” (Aenlle served for 17 years as a reserve deputy in the sheriff’s office, according to records held by the Commission on Peace Officers Standards and Training.)
Rumors were already swirling in the county building about the relationship between Corpus and Aenlle, according to the 408-page report, specifically a trip to Hawaii the pair took with Corpus’ children in October 2022, four months after she won election. 
Corpus’ then-husband, who was also a sworn member of the sheriff’s office, allegedly told a former sheriff’s office employee that “Corpus was having an affair with Aenlle and that he did not go on the Hawaii trip because Corpus told him that the flight was full and that there wasn’t a plane ticket available for him,” according to the report.
Corpus’ ex-husband could not be reached for comment.

A California sheriff is planning to break the state’s sanctuary law. Here’s how 

by Nigel Duara 





In an interview with CalMatters, Aenlle said he and Corpus are just close friends, and any other insinuations are meritless. 
“It’s made up,” Aellne said. “It’s fabricated. I’ve always spoken very highly and cared deeply about the sheriff. I came into the scene when she decided to run because I really saw the injustices in the department. I saw the abuse, the corruption.” 
Cordell found that Corpus violated the county’s policy on nepotism and conflicting relationships. She alleged in the report that, by 2024, Corpus had “relinquished control” of the department to Aenlle. 
Cordell afforded all of the 40 people she interviewed anonymity in the report. Most of the allegations relating to the personal relationship between Aenlle and Corpus are attributed to one person, identified only as Employee No. 3, a civilian working in the sheriff’s office. 
That person alleged that Corpus and Aenlle were physically intimate, sharing massages and on one occasion kissing in front of the employee.

Then there were the boots. 
Purchased at a Nordstrom’s, according to Employee No. 3, and hidden away in a black shoebox in the back of her van, the $1,200 boots – and an $11,000 pair of diamond earrings – were the physical embodiment of an inappropriate relationship between Corpus and Aenlle. 
Employee No. 3 told Cordell, according to the report, Corpus showed her the boots and said “I’m keeping them back here for now so (her then-spouse) won’t see them.” 
Over the next two years, Corpus would make at least four requests to raise Aenlle’s salary. One was granted, raising his pay to $246,979. The other three were denied by the county’s human resources department. 
Cordell concluded that their relationship went beyond friendship. She considered the earrings and the boots, allegations that Aenlle gave Corpus late-night rides home from the office 
“These, and so many more observations reported by interviewees demonstrate that Aenlle and Sheriff Corpus are not engaged in a ‘mere friendship,’” Cordell wrote.  
In the meantime, Corpus’ husband filed for divorce. 
Corpus has not responded to multiple calls from CalMatters seeking comment. When asked at a November press conference about her relationship with Aenlle, Corpus dismissed the allegations as “rhetoric.” 
“I have a personal relationship with Mr. Aenlle and with other members of my staff,” Corpus said during a heated reply at the press conference. “I’ve been dealing with this kind of rhetoric my entire career. I am a woman of color that has gone up the ranks in a male-dominated field. This is nothing new to me.” 
Meanwhile, morale in the office was cratering. 
“Of course it’s demoralizing,” said Eliot Storch, secretary of the San Mateo County sheriff’s deputies union. “Fear, retaliation, we are seeing it.”
The deputies’ union and the command staff of the sheriff’s office filed a complaint with the California Public Employment Relations Board, alleging that the sheriff and Aenlle had created a toxic work environment and were retaliating against union members. 
On Nov, 12, the county published Cordell’s report. 
Then, the mess at the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office turned into full-blown chaos. 
Deputies’ union president arrested
Hours before Cordell’s report was published, the president of the deputies’ union was arrested and charged with time card fraud.
The sheriff’s office alleged that the president, Carlos Tapia, was doing union business on company time and falsified the record of his working hours. But an investigation by the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office found no reason to charge Tapia, determining that the errors on his time cards were clerical and concluding that Tapia “should not have been arrested.” 
A captain in the sheriff’s office resigned rather than arrest Tapia, and Tapia alleged in a lawsuit filed against the county that Corpus demanded his arrest as retaliation against him for complaining about her leadership.

A series of formal no-confidence votes against Corpus followed: from the cities of San Carlos, Millbrae and San Mateo and from the Organization of Sheriff’s Sergeants, the union representing command staff. In its unanimous no-confidence vote, the Millbrae City Council cited “the decline in leadership, poor decision making, low morale, and a fear of retaliation by Sheriff Corpus and her executive management team” among the reasons for the resolution. 
A day after Tapia’s arrest, the county Board of Supervisors demanded Corpus’ resignation. She refused. But Aenlle was relieved of duty the day after the judge’s report’s release, according to county records released to CalMatters.  
Regardless, Corpus brought Aenlle back into the office in January, along with a puppy that, as is common with young dogs in new places, urinated a lot. Quite a lot, according to an email sent by a sheriff’s department captain to the rest of the staff and obtained by the Palo Alto Daily Post.  
Aenlle’s appearance was distressing to department employees who had spoken to Cordell as part of the county investigation, the email from Capt. Mark Myers said, and employees worried that Aenlle might have been carrying a concealed weapon.
Aenlle denies all of the allegations against him. He, like Corpus, believes he’s a victim of a long-entrenched good-old-boys network that was loath to release its grip on the county. 
“The minute I received that title (of executive director of administration), the jealousy ensued, and they had to do everything they could to break us down,” Aenlle said.  
Aenlle said he and Corpus arrived as reformers and immediately ran into resistance, followed by the allegations of an intimate personal relationship. 
He disputes several elements of the Cordell report, beginning with its design;  Aenlle said it’s unfair to grant anonymity to people who were free to make unsubstantiated claims about him and Corpus. 
For instance, he said, the report makes mention of his lack of law enforcement experience. Aenlle points to his time as a reserve deputy, but Cordell alleged he was out of compliance with the necessary hours to maintain his reserve status and could face misdemeanor charges in connection with wearing a gold sheriff’s office badge.
“This report hinges on the voices of just 40 individuals — current and former employees — who stand in opposition to progress,” Aenlle wrote in a four-page rebuttal to Cordell’s report. “These individuals represent a faction resistant to the transformative changes aimed at improving our communities, clinging instead to the remnants of a previous administration that lost the community’s trust and mandate to lead.”
Aenlle asserts that the transcripts released with the report of his interview by Cordell were missing crucial pages, including his own defenses of himself and Corpus, and his allegations of a set-up by San Mateo County Executive Mike Callagy. He also said he knows who Employee No. 3 is, and believes that person is seeking revenge because Corpus denied the employee a promotion.

But the biggest change Corpus made, he said, was the reason for the campaign to remove her from her elected office: Threatening the overtime pay deputies had come to expect. That, he said, led to the Cordell report and all of the ensuing fallout.
Some sheriff’s deputies in San Mateo County earn annual overtime that far exceeds their salaries. One deputy received $168,000 in regular pay in 2024 and $489,183.94 in overtime. Another deputy, also in 2024, earned $140,000 in regular pay and more than $318,000 in overtime. 
And beginning in 2024, in order to cover vacancies and encourage deputies to work overtime, the sheriff’s office offered double pay for overtime instead of the usual time-and-a-half pay. 
That, Aenlle said, led to ballooning overtime costs in the first half of 2024.
Aenlle said he has personally reviewed documents showing the sheriff’s office spent $17 million on overtime in the first six months of 2024, which would exceed the amount spent in any previous year. 
Corpus made the same assertions while defending her actions in a September press conference, alleging that Callaghy, the county executive, negotiated the massive overtime bill behind her back and without her knowledge, calling such actions “serious political dirty dealings.”
CalMatters requested a month-by-month breakdown of the county’s overtime spending on sheriffs’ deputies working in patrol and the jails. Records provided by the county show that in 2024, the sheriff’s office spent slightly less in the second half of the year, about $2.2 million per month, than it did in the first half of the year when it spent about $2.6 million per month on average. 
The records do not reflect a significant reduction in overtime spending after June 2024.  
Finally, on March 4, the question of how to handle Corpus went to the voters. Titled Measure A, the San Mateo County ballot measure asked voters to choose whether to amend the county charter to give the Board of Supervisors the power to remove the sheriff by a four-fifths vote. 
San Mateo is a charter county, giving its supervisors the cheaper and quicker option of removal, rather than a recall campaign. At least one California county sheriff has been recalled before, back in the 1970s, and a few have resigned with a recall on the ballot, but Corpus would be the first sheriff removed from office. 
The measure passed with 84% of the vote. Corpus again refused to resign, setting off a removal process at the county that’s expected to last about three months. At a board hearing in April, members of the public urged county supervisors to move quickly. 
The final removal hearing is scheduled to take place behind closed doors, though CalMatters has requested that the meeting be held in an open session. 
No matter what happens, Corpus may still face further investigations, this time by San Mateo County District Attorney Steven Wagstaffe, who said his office was looking into Corpus’ conduct but decided to wait until the removal process plays out. 
“We are waiting, but we have not closed (the investigation into Corpus),” Wagstaffe said. “There is evidence we have uncovered that provokes us to continue with our inquiry.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-25 12:33:19+00:00,CT Mirror,CT ACLU sues federal government for terminating international students’ status records,Eddy Martinez | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/25/ct-aclu-lawsuit-student-visas/,The ACLU claims the federal government unlawfully terminated the status records of international students studying in CT.,"The American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Connecticut (ACLU) is suing the federal government for unlawfully terminating the student status records of four international students who are studying in Connecticut.
The ACLU says the actions by the Trump administration now put their student visas in jeopardy.
The complaint, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court in New Haven, states the Department of Homeland Security terminated their F-1 student statuses along with hundreds of students nationwide, without explanation.
Attorneys with the ACLU are now requesting the government to reinstate their statuses with a temporary restraining order.
Elana Bildner, Senior Staff Attorney for the ACLU Foundation of Connecticut, is representing the students. Bildner says she’s eyeing a separate federal lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.
That nationwide case involves over 100 current and former international students, four of whom attend universities in Connecticut. Bildner is optimistic about their chances to force the government to reverse course.
“Overwhelmingly judges, I think, have been equally outraged by this obvious lack of due process and the fact that the government has not followed any of its procedures or done anything according to the law” Bildner said. “And so there has been a lot of success in these lawsuits.”
[RELATED: CT students’ visas revoked: As details emerge, fears escalate]
They have also claimed their statuses were unlawfully revoked but were able to win a temporary restraining order by the federal government, requiring it to reinstate their statuses for two weeks. The students are soon expecting a decision on if they’re allowed to maintain their statuses for the duration of the lawsuit.
The students have been named in the most recent lawsuit involving Connecticut international students.
They are: Yan Du, Elika Shams, Mengni He and Stephen Azu. More than 50 international students have had their statuses impacted throughout the state.
Unlike the federal lawsuit filed in Georgia, the lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court of Connecticut names her clients, due to uncertainty over being allowed to file anonymously in that specific court, according to Bildner.
Yan Du, who is a Chinese citizen, is in her sixth year as a PhD student studying Chemical and Environmental Engineering at Yale University, according to the complaint.
Du found out her status under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, (SEVIS), a federal database of international students studying in the United States, was terminated on April 4. The complaint states Yale mistakenly revoked her status in 2022 but was reinstated and states her F-1 status was revoked this year due to failing to otherwise maintain status.
Elika Shams, an Iranian citizen, is in her second year of pursuing a Biomedical Engineering PhD at the University of Connecticut. According to the complaint, Shams was never arrested but attempted to open the gateway door at an airport while agreeing to pay a fee, after questioning it, leading to a warning from the Transportation and Safety Administration in 2024. (TSA) She found out she lost her status on April 10.
Mengni He, a Chinese citizen , is studying for a PhD in Experimental Pathology at Yale University, according to the complaint. He was charged with a driving violation back in 2016. She ended up paying a fine, and traveling to China during that time, when she lost her visa status but was able to reinstate it shortly after. She was able to freely travel from that point on until April 9 when she was told by Yale her SEVIS status had been revoked due to a criminal record check and her previous loss of her visa status.
Stephen Azu, a citizen of Ghana, is currently admitted to begin studying for a PhD in statistics at UConn. Azu has had several driving violations, but was never convicted of a crime. He was told on April 9 his status had been terminated due to a criminal records check. He had to stop working as an analyst at UConn as a result of his status being revoked according to the complaint. He was also freely able to travel until earlier this month.
Bildner says her clients are assets to their universities.
“They’re doing really impressive scientific medical research, financial research, trying to work towards obtaining very impressive academic credentials,” she said.

,California,2025-04-25 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Fraud in California community colleges triggers call for Trump investigation,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/04/community-college/,"Following CalMatters reporting, California’s Republican representatives are calling for the U.S. Department of Education and Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate how California’s community colleges are handling financial aid fraud.","In summary
Following CalMatters reporting, California’s Republican representatives are calling for the U.S. Department of Education and Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate how California’s community colleges are handling financial aid fraud.


Nine Republican U.S. representatives are calling on U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate financial aid fraud at California’s community colleges. In a separate letter sent Wednesday, state Assemblymember Blanca Rubio, a West Covina Democrat, asked the state to conduct its own audit on the matter.
This rare moment of bipartisan concern comes after CalMatters reported that fake community college students have stolen more than $10 million in federal financial aid and more than $3 million in state aid in the last 12 months. 
In their April 11 letter to Bondi and McMahon, which cites CalMatters’ reporting, California’s Republican representatives say that investigating fraud at California’s community colleges should be part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing efforts to “curb wasteful federal spending.”  
The California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office has “not been contacted by the U.S. Department of Education or the U.S. Attorney General about an investigation,” said Chris Ferguson, one of the office’s executive vice chancellors, in an email to CalMatters Thursday.
Assemblymember Rubio’s letter calls for a state audit that would examine the scope of fraud and the efforts to prevent it. State legislators will decide this June whether to pursue that audit, which could take years to complete. 
California community colleges have been struggling to address fake students and financial aid fraud for years. Last spring, CalMatters reported that scammers continued to evade detection and that community colleges reported giving away over $5 million in federal funds and over $1.5 million in state and local aid. Earlier this month, CalMatters found the problem is only getting worse. 
“Allowing this rise in fraud to go unaddressed is negligent on the Community College system, as these bad actors take away opportunities from real students in impacted courses such as accounting, nursing, etc,” wrote the California Republican representatives in their letter.
While students, faculty and community college administrators in California agree that it’s a serious and growing problem, they question whether an investigation or an audit will lead to a better solution. 
Fraud is “a legitimate concern,” said Larry Galizio, president of the Community College League of California, which represents the interests of the state’s 73 community college districts — but the letter to the education department and the attorney general is “disingenuous” and “just flat wrong” in claiming that it’s gone unaddressed. 
California has allocated more than $150 million since 2022 to improve cybersecurity at its community colleges. 
“Blaming the victim and then cutting resources to the very entities that are trying to combat the fraud is not a policy approach that’s going to be effective,” Galizio said.
Overwhelmed with the number of fake students in their classes, “some of our faculty members feel like they’ve been screaming into the void,” said Stephanie Goldman, executive director of the faculty association of California Community Colleges. She said the federal scrutiny is particularly ironic, given that the Trump administration has dismantled the U.S. Department of Education and hampered its ability to investigate fraud. 
Representative Young Kim — who flipped her Orange County district in 2020 — led the effort to write the congressional letter. Her spokesperson, Callie Strock, refused to respond directly to criticisms when CalMatters asked about them. She said Kim is still learning about the issue and that “California has a long history of abusing taxpayer dollars.” 
Top priority: getting money to students in need
Since Trump’s inauguration in January, the federal government has regularly criticized California’s colleges and universities. The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating Stanford, UC Berkeley, UCLA, and UC Irvine for allegedly discriminating against students in the name of “diversity, equity and inclusion” — even though affirmative action has been illegal in California since 1996. The administration is also going after numerous UC campuses, as well as Sacramento State and Santa Monica College, for allegedly allowing “antisemitic harassment and discrimination.”  
California is fighting back by working with other states to file numerous lawsuits, such as one that attempts to stop the Trump administration from cancelling federal grants and another to prevent the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education.
But in this instance, the call to investigate California’s higher education system for fraud stems from California’s elected representatives, not from Trump or his cabinet. Kim’s spokesperson did not clarify whether officials from the Trump administration would actually pursue an investigation.
For Ivan Hernandez, a student at Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill, fraud is a low priority. Hernandez is the president of the community college students’ association, and while he said he suspects that some of the students in his online courses are fake — or at least are using AI to submit assignments — he’s more concerned with homelessness and food insecurity, which affect as many as half of California’s roughly 2 million community college students. 
Financial aid is supposed to pay for tuition, but low-income community college students pay little or no tuition in California, so the money goes directly into their pockets to offset the state’s high cost of housing and food. Most students who attend California’s community colleges are low-income and work a part- or full-time job.  
Ferguson, with the state chancellor’s office, said “it’s crucial to emphasize” that many fraudulent students are stopped before they can enroll. “For the nanoscopic number of criminals that did get past the application stage and moved to the enrollment stage, an even smaller number was able to breach the financial aid stage,” he said. 
“Financial aid fraud in the California Community Colleges system is extremely low relative to the billions of dollars of state and federal aid disbursed — about 0.21% in FY 2023-24. That means 99.8% of financial aid was disbursed to real students in our system.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/031225-US-Department-of-Education-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-25 09:00:26.891334

It also may not be legal.","In summary
Unions are pushing for shorter freight trains to make railways safer, but that could raise the cost of goods and delay passenger rail service. It also may not be legal.


If California’s politically influential labor unions get their way, the state’s freight trains would get shorter and potentially safer under a pending legislative proposal. 
But some Democratic lawmakers fear the measure could raise the price of goods in high-cost California, running counter to legislative leaders’ pledge to bring down the cost of living. They also worry that the need to run freight trains more frequently could cause delays for struggling passenger trains that rely on the same tracks and are frequently delayed by freight trains.
To top it off, independent experts, including those who work for the Legislature, say the measure almost certainly isn’t legal.
Nonetheless, Norwalk Democratic Sen. Bob Archuleta’s Senate Bill 667 passed its first committee hearing this week without a single Democrat casting a “no” vote.It’s the latest example of a flawed bill advancing through the Legislature due to Democrats’ reluctance to kill their colleagues’ measures in public, particularly when it means bucking the demands of influential organizations such as organized labor.Archuleta’s bill is a response to the 2023 train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio that forced thousands of residents to evacuate when toxic chemicals spilled and the train’s cars caught fire. Investigators blamed the derailment on an overheated wheel bearing that was not detected early enough by monitoring systems along the track. 
The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen is backing the measure, citing recent research showing that shorter trains are less likely to come off their tracks, an assertion railroad companies dispute. 
“We have had two recent scientific studies that confirm what railroad workers have known for years,” Ryan Snow, a representative for the union, told the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee. “Longer trains create greater safety risks.”  
Under Archuleta’s proposal, the maximum length of a freight train in California would be capped at 7,500 feet, about 125 60-foot-long rail cars. The train that derailed in East Palestine in 2023 was 151 cars and 9,300 feet long.
The measure also would require railroads to install “wayside detectors” every 10 to 15 miles that search for signs of train equipment failure, such as overheated wheel bearings. Freight trains wouldn’t be allowed to travel more than 10 mph on tracks without the sensors. It also would prohibit trains from blocking rail crossings to ensure that emergency vehicles can pass.
Rail companies would face fines of up to $25,000 per violation.
‘Many states have wanted to regulate train length’
Experts say the proposal has a major problem: It’s illegal under federal law, which gives the U.S. government the final say on regulating railroads.
“Federal and state courts have consistently preempted state statutes aimed at limiting train lengths and blocked crossings despite the absence of federal regulations addressing these issues,” reads the bill’s analysis written by the committee’s staff. “In some cases, the courts have deferred to the federal government’s broad authority over interstate commerce.”
In other words, if the measure were to be signed into law, it almost certainly wouldn’t survive a legal challenge, said Professor Roger Nober, director of the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University. 
“Many states have wanted to regulate train length or block crossings, and I certainly understand the frustration that would lead the states to want to do that,” he said in an interview. “But that is a federal responsibility. It is pretty clear.”
Other unions supporting the bill include the California Professional Firefighters, the California School Employees Association and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. In total, those three unions have donated at least $9.4 million to legislators since 2015, according to the Digital Democracy database. 
They have a staunch ally in Archuleta, who has voted with the unions’ positions on bills more than 90% of the time, according to Digital Democracy.“We’re here to save lives and keep the trains moving, but do it productively and do it with the dignity of the workers that are here,” he told the committee.
At least two dozen shipping, agricultural, timber and building groups oppose the bill, along with the California Chamber of Commerce. In total, the opponents have given at least $10.2 million to lawmakers since 2015, according to Digital Democracy.
Train industry officials also oppose it. They say the regulations aren’t needed. 
Recent advances in computer modeling, including a “learning physics engine that simulates every train on our network” and other technologies have reduced the number of derailments and other safety problems, said David O’Hara, an official at Union Pacific Railroad, at the hearing.

Shortening trains cuts into railroad companies’ bottom lines, Joseph Towers, a rail industry analyst with FTR Transportation Intelligence, told CalMatters.
“Trains get longer because you’re able to pull the same amount of freight with fewer resources,” he said. “You have to have less engines, less crew.”
The measure also comes at a particularly uncertain time for California’s 5,000-mile railway network that hauls more than 5.5 million rail car loads of goods each year and employs several thousand workers.
Towers said President Donald Trump’s tariffs, especially on Chinese imports coming into California ports, could dramatically reduce the amount of freight trains will haul. 
“When it comes to train shipping, there’s going to be less freight on rail that can be attributed to those international … imports arriving on the West Coast,” Towers said. 
Longer delays for passenger trains
The four Republicans on the committee voted against the measure and all 12 of the committee’s Democrats that were present voted for it. 
However, some Democrats who voted said they wanted Archuleta to amend the bill to address concerns about consumer costs, public transportation and its obvious legal problems.
The committee’s chair, Sen. Josh Becker of Menlo Park, said he has “some concerns about the federal preemption issue.”
He also urged Archuleta “to make sure our efforts to improve safety do not result in the kind of good movement (restrictions) and price spikes that we saw happen and hit consumers during the pandemic.”
Sen. Ben Allen, who represents the El Segundo area, was worried after listening to testimony from Stacey Mortensen. She oversees Amtrak and ACE passenger train service in the San Joaquin Valley and the Bay Area on tracks managed primarily for freight haulers. 
“Given that we run on a freight rail line, any requirements that are passed on to them have a ripple effect that end up affecting the end user,” she said.
Increasing train ridership is a key part of California’s ambitious strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change.
Allen said that California’s “subpar” passenger train network already has difficulty attracting riders because of logistical problems caused by freight trains.
“There’s a beautiful train network around the state, and yet it can be such an unpleasant experience when you’re stuck behind freight rail,” he told the committee.
Despite their concerns, both Becker and Allen voted to keep the train bill chugging along to its next stop, the Senate Transportation Committee, where the measure will be heard on Monday.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/091422_Train_LV__007.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-25 09:00:26.891334

(Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications)Missouri House Republicans aren’t ready to give up on dual goals of enacting a flat income tax and cutting the overall rate, and have loaded a Senate bill with their latest plan — flat tax and capital gains cut now, rate cuts later.
On April 7, the state Senate approved a bill exempting capital gains — profits from property or investments held for more than a year — from state income tax. Individuals would get the break right away, while corporations would be allowed the exemption when revenue triggers lower the top individual income tax rate to 4.5%. The current top rate is 4.7%.

One vote and that bill, sponsored by House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins, is on its way to Gov. Mike Kehoe. The House passed the original version on a party-line vote in February.
But there’s no rush to bring it to a vote, even though Perkins has said he is ready.
“We have been hanging on to that bill for a little while, the House bill, to preserve options as we go into these last three weeks of session,” House Majority Leader Alex Riley of Springfield said Thursday.
Next week, Riley said, the House will debate a bill loaded with property tax changes as well as the flat tax at a rate of 4.7%, an immediate capital gains exemption and a 10-step income tax rate cut. The changes made in the bill, originally passed in the Senate as a simple exemption for National Guard active duty pay during state activations, boosted the estimate cost from $47,282 to as much as $1.7 billion when fully implemented in 2037 or later.
“We just want to see what opportunities we have over these last three weeks of session,” Riley said.
State Sen. Adam Schnelting of St. Charles, the sponsor of the bill, isn’t pleased with the changes.
“We’re at that stage in the game where things aren’t moving as quickly or as often as people would like, and so when you send something to the other chamber, it’s just natural at this point for them to load it up,” Schnelting said.
Items added to Schnelting’s bill in addition to an income tax cut would:

Decrease the percentage of the value of vehicles and other personal property to 32% and remove the value of personal property from tax rate adjustments based on reassessments. 
Increase the income tax limits and credit amounts for the refundable credit known as the circuit breaker. The credit is for property taxes paid by homeowners and renters who are 65 or older or who have a qualifying disability.
Limit new local property tax revenue from the increased value of real estate to 3% or inflation, whichever is less.

The political stakes behind the tax cut are adding pressure to make some kind of reduction this year. During the 2024 campaign, Kehoe and his Republican primary opponents all campaigned on a promise to eliminate the state income tax.
Since 2014, when lawmakers enacted a tax cut over the veto of then-Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, Missouri’s top income tax rate has fallen from 6% to 4.7%. Two future tax cuts, to a 4.5% rate, are already in state law and will take effect if general revenue growth hits targets.
But revenues have declined more than 1% so far this fiscal year and the two-step test for the trigger is unlikely to be met this year or in fiscal 2026, which begins July 1, according to estimates from the Office of Budget and Planning.
The next rate cut to 4.6%, put into law in 2022, is not likely before Jan. 1, 2028, when Kehoe will be seeking re-election.
The proposal going to the full House would not speed up the steps, but it would add a new layer of cuts that would eventually take the rate to 3.4%.
 State Sen. Adam Schnelting, a Republican from St. Charles, speaks in March at a Missouri Right to Life rally in the Missouri State Capitol Building (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The proposal is a prudent one at a time of revenue uncertainty, said state Rep. Mike McGirl, a Potosi Republican who will handle it during the House debate.
“You have to achieve a certain amount of revenue in order for a trigger to work,” McGirl said. “So whatever revenue is lost by that trigger is actually a wash. Now anything over the trigger is new revenue.”
Democrats, who hold fewer than one-third of the seats in the Missouri House, will be unable to defeat the proposal on their own. But they will argue that it makes permanent cuts to the state’s future revenue at a time when the fiscal needs of the next year are not clear.
Missouri is heavily dependent on federal revenue for roads, health care and education programs. Any federal changes that alter the rate for state matching funds would rapidly increase demands on the state treasury.
“We’re not sure what we’re going to be getting from the feds,” said state Rep. Del Taylor of St. Louis, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. “We are expecting some pretty lean years, and some of it is self imposed by all these tax cuts and tax cuts on capital gains.”
State Rep. Adrian Plank, a Columbia Democrat, said he likes proposals such as increasing the income limits on the circuit breaker but is dismayed it is paired with cuts that favor wealthy individuals.
Most of the benefits from a cut in the capital gains rate for individuals would go to a small slice of taxpayers. The 23,800 federal income tax returns for 2022 from Missouri reporting incomes greater than $500,000 a year represent 0.8% of all returns but 65% of the capital gains income.
“If I was in control, I would say, let’s give the working class tax breaks and make the people who have all that privilege pay their fair share,” Plank said. 
Meanwhile, the capital gains tax cut bill passed by the Senate, which includes numerous other tax reductions, sits idle awaiting the House to send it to the governor. 
Perkins said he’s not concerned the delay on his bill will put a tax cut in danger. 
“We’ve got a little bit of time left and it’s all over here in the House,” Perkins said. “We can make it happen quickly when the time comes.”
The cost estimate for Perkins’ bill forecasts it would reduce revenue by about $240 million in the coming fiscal year, with an ongoing reduction of about $350 million annually when the corporate capital gains cut kicks in.
The official estimate, however, has been challenged as too low by the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
The institute’s estimate is based on IRS data from 2022 that showed $13.3 billion in long-term capital gains reported on individual returns from Missouri. Using the state’s top tax rate of 4.7%, applied to taxable income more than $8,911, the institute estimated the revenue from that much income would be about $625 million.
The Missouri Department of Revenue stands by its estimate that the individual capital gains cut would reduce revenue by about $110 million annually. 
The corporate capital gains cut would reduce revenue by about $180 million annually. Delaying the corporate cut until individual rates decline was one of the concessions negotiated by Democrats in the Senate. Democrats also won the tax changes targeting lower-income Missourians to balance the package.
The change to the circuit breaker credit limits in the Senate-passed version of Perkins’ bill would reduce revenue by about $72 million. A sales tax exemption for adult diapers would reduce revenue by $17 million annually and a similar exemption for baby diapers would cost the state about $1.7 million a year.
Missouri collected $13.4 billion in general revenue in the most recent fiscal year. Estimates published in December project $13.6 billion of general revenue in the year that starts July 1.
On Tuesday, the Senate will debate a state operating budget that would spend $15.7 billion from general revenue, a plan that is balanced by using money from the accumulated surplus. There is another $770 million of general revenue dedicated to capital improvement projects in bills awaiting a hearing in the Senate Appropriations Committee.
  Sen. Lincoln Hough, a Republican from Springfield, presents the Senate-passed tax cut bill to the House Budget Committee in September 2022 during a special session (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Commuications).
State Sen. Lincoln Hough, a Republican from Springfield and chairman of the appropriations committee, said the budget proposal leaves a healthy cash balance. 
In a 2022 tax cut bill he sponsored, Hough wrote the two-step trigger for future tax cuts. The next cut will occur when revenue in a fiscal year exceeds the highest of the previous three years by $200 million and the revenue five years previously by more than the intervening rate of inflation.
“My job is not just to look at this fiscal year, but it’s really to look at that runway and what it looks like in the future,” Hough said.
Hough voted for Perkins’ bill when it passed the Senate. But he’s not willing to go along with putting new rate cuts into law while the state faces both revenue and federal funds uncertainty.
“It’s easy to cut taxes, or say you want to cut taxes when we still have money,” Hough said. “What happens in three or four years? What happens in two years? What happens if the federal government changes the reimbursement rate on our expanded Medicaid population?”

Colorado had a 4.5% increase in births last year, the largest in the nation, as births increased nationally for the first time since 2021. (Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.

Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A bill significantly restructuring the governance of large municipal water systems sailed through the Alabama Senate Thursday.
SB 330, sponsored by Sen. Dan Roberts, R-Mountain Brook, is broadly worded but effectively targets the Birmingham Water Works Board (BWWB). The legislation overcame potential resistance after last-minute changes that expanded the proposed regional board.
“I think we have the makings of a great water system here with what we’re doing … we’re after a board whose goal is to work together, to provide true, true loyalty to the customer base, not to anyone else,” Roberts said after the bill’s passage.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bill applies to municipal water works boards that serve customers across four or more counties beyond the one where the authorizing city is located. It mandates converting such entities into regional boards; establishing new rules for board member appointments, qualifications and terms; implementing stricter ethics and financial reporting requirements and outlining specific board duties.
Roberts said the changes are necessary for competent management and to prevent operational failures.
“We’re losing 50% of the water that we pump that’s potable. That’s so far outside what is normative across the country. The replacement of pipes is probably responsible for some of this, but we’re spending money on so many other things than showing a fiduciary responsibility to the customer base,” Roberts said.
Changes to the BWWB have drawn strong opposition from Democrats in the Jefferson County delegation, who have filibustered similar pieces of legislation over the years over concerns that Birmingham and Jefferson County, the BWWB’s largest customers, would lose power over water decisions to suburban counties. Democrats have also noted that the changes would take power from Birmingham, which is 67% Black, and shift it to majority-white suburban counties.

Sen. Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, who has led opposition to BWWB changes, declined to comment after the bill passed, saying that he’ll “talk about it once the governor signs it.”
Roberts said the changes came “after hard negotiations for several hours yesterday until late last night, and then again this morning,” which led to adding two additional members. Roberts said he preferred a board of five members because it would be easier “to get them pulling in the same direction.”
“We sat down as a Jefferson County delegation and hammered it out in a back room of what it would take to get this bill to pass without creating lots of problems for the rest of our colleagues here in the Senate and the House,” Roberts said.
The first amendment expanded the proposed board from five members to seven, adding one director appointed by the Governor and another by the governing body of the authorizing municipality, which would be the Birmingham City Council. Both appointees would have to live in Jefferson County. The second amendment requires the new regional board to include the authorizing municipality’s name, Birmingham, in its official title.
The bill specifies that certain board positions require financial, engineering, or general business backgrounds and sets initial staggered terms before transitioning to five-year terms, with a limit of two full terms. Directors will receive $2,000 per month plus expenses.  
Frank E. Adams, a spokesperson for Birmingham Water Works Board (BWWB), said in a statement that despite amendments adding local appointees, the board strongly opposes the bill and sees it as a “hostile takeover by outside interests.”
“BWWB’s daily focus is continuing to make improvements to our customer service, infrastructure and the overall operations of the system.  We have made significant improvement in those areas over the last few months and SB 330 limits that progress,” Adams said in the statement.
Board leaders previously indicated that operations are improving, according to al.com, and that monthly billing errors have been reduced to 500, down from 10,000.
The bill now moves to the Alabama House of Representatives for consideration. House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, said the legislation will be a priority in the last few days of session.

((Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)Charter schools made up five of the nine public employers in Nevada that at some point over the past 2 years fell more than 90 days delinquent on retirement contributions, state lawmakers learned Wednesday.
The Public Employees’ Retirement System of Nevada — better known as PERS — is now backing a bill in the state Legislature to establish a mechanism that allows them to recoup the delinquent contributions.
“The category of employer we’ve had the most trouble with is charter schools,” PERS Executive Officer Tina Leiss told lawmakers on the Assembly Government Affairs Committee Wednesday.
With other types of public employers, such as local government, PERS is able to turn to the Nevada Department of Taxation, which has the authority to withhold payments of public dollars to the county, city or agency behind on the payments.
“Over the years we’ve been able to use that process successfully,” Leiss added. “With charter schools there really is, right now, no one that we can go to that has authority over them.”
Senate Bill 418 would enable the State Superintendent of Public Schools to withhold a charter school’s per-pupil dollars in order to pay PERS. That option would only be available after the charter school is more than 90 days behind. The bill was unanimously approved by the Senate earlier this month and heard by the Assembly Government Affairs Committee on Wednesday. No groups have registered opposition to the bill.
Any public employer falling behind on PERS contributions is a problem because it affects people’s ability to retire. PERS cannot pay out a person’s pension if the employer is behind on their contributions.
Kent Ervin, who follows the Retirement Board as part of his work with the Nevada Faculty Alliance, called it “outrageous and simply unacceptable.”
“These public charter schools have deducted the PERS contributions from employee’s paychecks but did not forward even those amounts to PERS. Some have also not reported the service credits,” he said, referring to the amount of time a person has worked in a PERS-eligible position, which affects pension levels. “It’s a disgrace.”
With charter schools, there is the added concern that they could shut down and never pay what they owe, leaving the state on the hook.
“I’m not picking on charter schools,” Leiss said, “but charter schools are one of the few government entities that cease to exist. Our cities, counties, school districts, fire departments don’t close.”
Two charter schools — TEACH Las Vegas and Eagle Charter Schools, both in Southern Nevada — were delinquent on PERS payments before they shut down last year. PERS was paid the amounts owed as part of the closing of those schools.
According to a memo from Nevada State Public Charter School Authority Executive Director Melissa Mackedon to the Charter School Board, NV Prep and Equipo Academy are on PERS contribution repayment plans approved by the Nevada Retirement Board.
PERS staffer Teresa Chalmers told lawmakers that, as of April 12, the two charter schools had a combined outstanding balance of $266,120.
The SPCSA memo lists a third charter school, Sage Collegiate, as being delinquent as of mid-April. The school was also identified by the SPCSA as being delinquent in late 2023, though it caught up.
At least two other schools were identified by SPCSA as being delinquent but have since caught up.
Leiss said that at one point charter schools had a combined $1 million in contributions delinquent. She also said she had no insight into why charter schools might be more prone to falling behind on PERS contributions than other public employers.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IMG_9460-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-25 08:01:20.262940
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-25 12:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT offers a ‘miraculous’ stroke treatment. A proposal would provide it to vets,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/25/ct-vivistim-stroke-treatment/,Lawmakers want to start a program for veterans to undergo a new procedure designed to help stroke survivors regain functionality for free.,"A year ago, John Nute couldn’t brush his teeth with his left arm, drive with both hands or peel shrimp. A stroke in 2013 had immobilized much the left side of his body. He’d lost the job he loved running a marina and the housing that came with it. 
But Nute’s life changed significantly over the last 12 months following the implant of a technology known as Vivistim that’s gaining attention in Connecticut. 
State lawmakers are looking to establish a program at the University of Connecticut, where 10 veterans will be able to undergo the procedure for free and physicians will conduct further research to improve the effectiveness of the treatment. The $55.7 billion two-year budget adopted by the legislature’s Appropriations Committee on Tuesday includes $2 million in fiscal year 2027 to establish a Center of Excellence for Neuromodulation Treatment at UConn.
The Vivistim device, implanted in a patient’s neck and chest, includes a battery and a narrow cable that wraps around the vagus nerve. When turned on, the device sends electrical signals to the brain.

Neuromodulation, as it’s known, refers to the process of altering how the brain receives information from the body by stimulating nerves. 
For reasons physicians still don’t entirely understand, employing neuromodulation by stimulating the vagus nerve through electric signals appears to rapidly increase the rate at which the brain learns new tasks. When paired with physical therapy, the device can help stroke survivors regain lost functionality — even if, like Nute, their stroke occurred several years earlier.  
“It supercharges therapy,” Christopher Conner, the UConn neurosurgeon who performed the procedure on Nute. “You basically get into a state where your brain is able to learn or adapt more quickly,” he said.
Conner was among a group of physicians on the state’s Veterans with Disabilities Task Force who sought funding from the legislature to cover the procedure at UConn and subsequent rehabilitation at Hartford HealthCare for ten veterans. The funding would offer much-needed health care to an underserved group, as well as provide physicians and researchers with more data about how exactly the procedure improves results for stroke patients, according to supporters.

How does it work?
People who suffer strokes often hit a recovery plateau beyond which it’s difficult for them to continue making progress towards regaining mobility. 
Neuromodulation offers results far beyond what’s been available in stroke recovery up to this point, according to several providers in the state. Connecticut physicians said they’ve seen patients regain basic functionality and return to hobbies — like cooking, playing guitar, and golfing — that they had to give up after their stroke. 
Nute was still struggling with physical side effects when he saw an advertisement on Facebook promoting a new technology that could boost hand and arm function after a stroke. 
“I just got tired of having my mobility impaired and wanted to improve it,” Nute said. Eager for results and open to new solutions, Nute reached out to the company and then an occupational therapist to learn more. 
When they met roughly a month later, in January 2024, Conner told Nute that he wanted to be transparent: He had never done the procedure before. 
“I said, ‘Well, I haven’t either, so that’s two of us,’” Nute recalled with a laugh. 
Nute underwent the procedure in May of 2024, and since then he said his range of motion has increased significantly. He loves to cook, so he’s most excited about the accomplishments that translate to the kitchen. Nute still attends group rehabilitation regularly, both in-person and on Zoom, and he also receives Botox injections every three months that help to relax the muscles in his arm. 
“When I first got the thing done, I wasn’t noticing improvements right away,” Nute said. But over time, he said, that changed. “When I look at videos of myself before and after, I can see significant differences.”

Conner has now done a total of 12 implants, with another five booked in the next few months. He said he gets calls weekly from patients all over the country who want to come to Connecticut for the procedure. 
“The interest in this is unbelievable,” Conner said during public testimony at the state legislature. “Here at the University of Connecticut, we’ve established ourselves as a nation-leading center for this.”
Vagus nerve stimulation isn’t entirely new, Conner said. It’s been used in the past to treat seizures and depression, with limited results. But using the treatment for stroke recovery is novel — the Food and Drug Administration approved Vivistim to treat upper extremity impairments post-stroke in August 2021.
The real “magic,” as Conner puts it, happens in therapy, which patients begin two weeks after getting the implant. For six weeks, patients attend rehabilitation three times a week, for 90 minutes per session. The sessions focus on completing upper extremity exercises, like reach and grasp, object flipping and needle threading.

Each task is repeated about 50 times, and patients might perform a total of 300 repetitions in a single session, Subramani Seetharama, a rehabilitation specialist at Hartford HealthCare, said. As the patient performs these exercises, the physician turns on the Vivistim system, which sends those electric signals to the patient’s brain. 
Seetharama, who’s been practicing medicine for 30 years, said he’s been frustrated that treatments available to stroke patients up until now have only offered temporary improvements. 
“It’s been kind of disappointing,” Seetharama said. “But here I see an amazing, lasting, persistent improvement in strength and function.” 
Carolyn Brown, cofounder of StrokeOT Inc. and an occupational therapist who has treated Nute and other Vivistim patients, stated in written public hearing testimony that she has “witnessed truly miraculous results.”
“Vivistim has given chronic stroke survivors renewed hope and optimism for their continued recovery journey,” she wrote.

State funding
Physicians still have lots of questions about how the mechanics of neuromodulation helps facilitate better results for stroke patients. 
The proposed state funding would go towards studying brain activity in patients at different points in their treatment. It would also fund research on the effects of the treatment on patients’ ability to walk. Vivistim is currently only FDA-approved for upper extremity recovery. 
“One of the dirty secrets of many things in modern medicine is we have a poor understanding of how it works,” Conner said. “The problem with that is that it makes it very difficult to make to optimize that therapy. So what we want to do is we want to figure out what parts of the brain are actually leading to this improved learning ability.”
Richard Foust, CEO of Vivistim distributor MicroTransponder Inc., said in emailed comments that “the company applauds UConn Health, Hartford HealthCare and all the champions of this bill for bringing it closer to fruition.”
“MicroTransponder is incredibly honored that this legislation will make Vivistim available to our Veterans to improve their hand and arm function post-stroke,” wrote Foust.
During the public hearing for the proposal, Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien, asked whether there are other potential funding sources for this treatment and research outside of the state government. Conner said that in the current environment, much of grant funding is on hold. 
“Granting agencies and the program officers are telling people that nothing is getting reviewed,” Conner said.

Nute said the idea of more people getting access to Vivistim is “wonderful” and that funding for research is “needed.” More than a decade after his stroke, he remains deeply involved in the survivor community. He serves on the board of a stroke survivors support group and regularly speaks about his experience with neuromodulation.
“I talk to people virtually everyday who’ve either had a stroke or they know somebody that’s had a stroke and try to get them thinking that this is not the end of the road,” Nute said. “There is hope. Don’t give up.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0314_SR_JohnNute_077-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-25 08:01:20.262940

Days before his scheduled trial, Mack Charles Parker, a 23-year-old Black truck driver, was lynched after midnight by a hooded mob of white men in Poplarville, Mississippi. 
Parker had been accused of raping a pregnant white woman and was being held in a local jail. A deputy reportedly unlocked the jail, enabling a white mob to enter Parker’s cell. The mob dragged Parker head first down the stairs, leaving a bloody trail. The mob then beat him, took him to a bridge, shot and killed him, then weighed his body down with chains and dumped him in the river. 
FBI agents identified the jailer, Jewel Alford, as giving the mob the keys. Another alleged participant was J.P. Walker, elected sheriff of Pearl River County four years later. Other suspects included “Crip” Reyer, L. C. Davis, “Preacher” James Floren Lee, his son James Floren “Jeff” Lee, Herman Schultz and Arthur Smith who supplied the names of Walker, Preacher Lee, L.C. Davis and the names of others who were in the two cars. Smith told agents that Lee, Reyer, Davis and Walker were in the lead car that carried Parker from the jail.

SB 112, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, allocates $9.9 billion for K-12 schools and higher education, a 6% increase over the current budget. The House Ways and Means Education Committee approved the budget on Tuesday.
“This was an important budget. I think the members understood it, but the work got done,” Garrett said.

The budget also includes $135 million for the CHOOSE Act, a voucher-like program that will award students with funds to be used for education-related expenses, including private school tuition. The program was initially slated to get $100 million, but Garrett said that because of the nearly 37,000 applications there needed to be more money for qualifying students. 
“We have had such an enormous response to the application process. So there were a lot of moving pieces here,” Garrett said after the House adjourned.
The program is currently limited to special needs students and those making under 300% of the poverty line, about $79,950 for a family of three. The program will be open to all applicants starting in 2027, without any income limits. About two-thirds of the 37,000 applicants for the program this year are already in private school or homeschooled.
The budget also includes a $99.2 million increase for the Public Education Employees’ Health Insurance Plan. There are no pay raises for education employees in the budget. 
Garrett said they also had to allocate funds for educator workmen’s compensation and paid parental leave.
“So we had a lot of things in the budget, but the good news was we had adequate reserves. We had limited our budget growth every year for the past several years,” he said.
The budget passed 103-0 with a House committee substitute. It moves to the Senate for concurrence or conference committee. The Senate approved the budget on April 10.
Garrett said one of his priorities in the budget is continuing to invest in public education in the state. SB 305, also sponsored by Orr, allows the Legislature to appropriate additional funds to schools based on student needs. The House added an additional $58 million to begin the transition to the new model. The bill passed 103-0. It goes to Gov. Kay Ivey to be signed into law. 
SB 111, also sponsored by Orr, would appropriate $375 million over three years for that transition, which aims to get more money to students with particular needs, including children in poverty and English Language Learners. 
“Every district can report how many students they have that are in the poverty definition, how many are in special education, how many are English as a second language,” he said. “And what we will do is allocate this additional pot of money to those districts based upon that weight.”
Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, supported the weighted funding model. Under the legislation, Montgomery County Schools will receive $7.7 million with most coming from the 2.5% weight for poverty.
“I know students in Montgomery Public Schools are going to be better off because of this,” Ensler said.
The bill passed 103-0 with a House committee substitute that added $80 million to the Education Opportunity Reserve Fund for the CHOOSE Act. It goes to the Senate for concurrence or conference committee. The Senate adjourned Thursday before final approval of the budgets, so its consideration was not possible Thursday.
The House also passed SB 113, also sponsored by Orr, which is the $524 million 2025 supplemental appropriation for education. It passed 103-0 with a House committee substitute that added funds for various needs. It also passed with a floor amendment from Garrett that changed language to clarify funding for dual enrollment programs. It moves to the Senate for concurrence or conference committee. 
The House also passed SB 114, also sponsored by Orr, which is the $1.25 billion supplemental appropriation for the Advancement and Technology budget. It passed 103-0 with a House committee substitute that added a $100 million grant to create career technical programs in areas of the state that do not have one already.  It moves to the Senate for concurrence or conference committee.
Garrett said that he hopes the creation of the programs will improve Alabama’s labor participation rate. The state ranks 47th in labor participation at 57.8%, according to the U.S. Joint Economic Committee.
“These initiatives that we’ve undertaken, through improving education, through increasing the Career Tech opportunities and collaboration with community colleges, all of that,” he said. “If that drives that labor participation rate up, the state is in a really good position.” 
House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainsville, commended the budget committee and Garrett for their work on the budget. 
“This was a great deal. Chairman Garrett did outstanding. His committee works hard, and the work showed that today,” Ledbetter said.

Dina Titus told state lawmakers Wednesday that efforts to open up more federal lands for development “doesn’t do anything about affordable housing,” and warned of the consequences Nevadans will face as a result of economic and budget policies being pursued by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.  U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto an[...]","“That bill doesn't do anything about affordable housing and certainly doesn't require anybody to pay for the infrastructure that's going to be needed for that growth,” Rep. Dina Titus told state lawmakers about a measure the overwhelming majority of them support. (Nevada legislative stream screengrab)U.S. Rep. Dina Titus told state lawmakers Wednesday that efforts to open up more federal lands for development “doesn’t do anything about affordable housing,” and warned of the consequences Nevadans will face as a result of economic and budget policies being pursued by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. 
U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and U.S. Rep. Susie Lee, both Democrats, reintroduced the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act, commonly referred to as the Clark County Lands Bill, in March. 
The measure would open 25,000 acres of public land in Southern Nevada that Cortez Masto and Lee say could lead to development of more affordable housing.
Opponents warn the bill is a recipe for unsustainable urban sprawl that will not significantly address the housing shortage. 
In a statement emailed to Nevada Current, Titus said she is opposed to the lands bill as it is currently written, saying it will make “land available to developers to build more homes that average Nevadans cannot afford.”
“There is no requirement for set-asides for affordable housing in new developments,” in the legislation, Titus said in the email. “Affordable housing should be the goal of a lands bill, not incidental to it.”
Titus sponsored a version of the bill with Cortez Masto in 2021. In a statement, her office said “it has become clearer since 2021 that developers want to build more expensive homes in the ‘ex-urbs,’” and “the cost of providing infrastructure has become prohibitively expensive” especially considering the impact of Trump’s tariffs on building materials.
State lawmakers recently passed a resolution backing the passage of the federal bill, which Titus took aim at while addressing them in Carson City. 
“You’re supporting a lands bill and think that’s a silver bullet for affordable housing,” Titus said to legislators. “That bill doesn’t do anything about affordable housing and certainly doesn’t require anybody to pay for the infrastructure that’s going to be needed for that growth.”
When asked about Titus’ comments to state lawmakers, Lauren Wodarski, a spokesperson for Cortez Masto, said the senator has repeatedly called for an “all of the above approach” to address the housing crisis. 
She also noted the legislation is supported by “affordable housing organizations and local governments who all agree it is necessary to make more land available for housing development in Southern Nevada.”
In her email to the Current, Titus also underscored the point she made to state lawmakers that the lands bill does not take into account “the cost of providing infrastructure to outlying developments, which taxpayers rather than developers would be required to pay for.” She also said the legislation would “create new burdens on our limited water supply.”
Another “major flaw” of the federal lands bill is that “it encourages expensive urban sprawl when there are lands within our existing urban area that could be developed without distant and costly extensions of infrastructure,” Titus noted.
A local analysis by the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern and the regional planning collaborative known as Southern Nevada Strong has shown significant infill land available.
The study, released in February, found 78,285 acres that “were identified as vacant or underutilized land” and “approximately 85% (69,300 acres) was classified as vacant, while the remaining 15% was deemed underutilized.”
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has long pushed for more federal land to be opened up as a solution to develop housing. 
Lombardo sent several letters to the Biden administration last year that blamed the administration for its role in the housing crisis, saying it wasn’t doing enough to make more federal land available for housing development.
Assembly Joint Resolution 10, which also calls on the federal government to release federal lands, passed April 17, 36-6, with overwhelming support from Democrats and unanimous support from Republicans. 
Six Democratic Assemblymembers, Natha Anderson, Venicia Considine, Tanya Flanagan, Selena La Rue Hatch, Cinthia Moore, and Howard Watts, voted against the resolution.
The measure has not been voted on in the Senate. 
‘You’ll be back’
Titus, who herself served in the Nevada Legislature for two decades prior to winning election to federal office, spent most of her address to state lawmakers warning of a “tsunami” of challenges coming to Nevada as a result of actions already taken by Trump as well as policies Trump is pushing the Republican held Congress to enact.
Trump’s sweeping global tariffs will will increase the price not only of consumer goods, but also the cost of housing, Titus said. 
“If you’re going to put tariffs on construction materials like steel, lumber and aluminum and you’re going to try to build affordable housing, those prices are going to go up,” she said. 
Trump’s many tariffs currently in effect include a global 25% levy on aluminum, lumber, and steel.
“Again, that’s going to hurt Nevadans and make it harder at a time we need more housing for people to get into a house,” Titus said.
Republicans in Congress have also proposed sweeping cuts to various federal programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP.
Trump has issued multiple executive orders curtailing, halting or ending altogether federal funding for a host of federal programs.
Elon Musk, the billionaire head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has also cut swaths of federal funding, positions and projects. 
Noting about 30% of Nevada total state government funding comes from the federal government, Titus warned  state lawmakers they will be forced to deal with the consequences of federal cuts. 
“As y’all have to deal with every day, Nevada requires a balanced budget,” Titus said. “You’re going to have to deal with what’s coming on May 1,” she said, referring to the date when the state Economic Forum will set its final budget limits that legislators and the governor must meet when they approve a budget for the upcoming biennium.
“When you get the economic forecast May 1, you’ll be hearing how much funds will be cut and how much you can spend. I’m not too optimistic,” Titus said, adding “it’s likely you’ll be back in a special session when you figure out just how much it is you’re going to have to cut or pay for or eliminate.”
“You have to deal with this firestorm somehow,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/dinatitus-at-legislature-1024x630.jpg,,,2025-04-25 08:01:20.262940

Colorado had a 4.5% increase in births last year, the largest in the nation, as births increased nationally for the first time since 2021. (Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.
When taking a broader look at the number of births from 2019, just before the pandemic, to 2024, Idaho leads the nation with a 5% increase in births, followed by Tennessee (4%), and South Carolina, North Carolina, and Texas, all with a 3% rise. Hawaii saw the largest drop, at 12%, followed by California, Illinois, Louisiana, and New Mexico, where births fell by 10%.

Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce.
In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers.
Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

McDonald,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/04/25/montclair-health-benefits-matter-raises-questions-about-democrat-running-for-governor/,"As Sean Spiller campaigns for governor, his record as mayor of Montclair has received scant attention.","As Sean Spiller campaigns for governor, his record as mayor of Montclair has received scant attention. (Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor/Spiller photo by Dana DiFilippo)There’s a years-old scandal involving one of our candidates for governor and no one’s talking about it.
Well, almost no one. State Sen. Mike Testa brought it up during a recent budget hearing with Attorney General Matt Platkin. Testa, a Cumberland County Republican, asked Platkin why his office prosecuted the GOP former mayor of Wildwood for fraudulently obtaining town health benefits for his part-time city job — New Jersey law says benefits are meant for full-time workers only — yet has not filed similar charges against a Democratic ex-mayor of Montclair and current gubernatorial candidate accused of the same thing.
Testa didn’t name names, but he meant Sean Spiller, president of statewide teachers union the New Jersey Education Association. You may know him from the tens of thousands of vote-for-Spiller flyers that have been showering the state since the fall.
“That case never reached a criminal court, while the case in Wildwood was presented to the grand jury not once but twice, and has been pursued aggressively. You’ve recused yourself from the Montclair investigation, which stopped completely dead in its tracks. Why such a disparity between those two cases?” Testa asked Platkin.
Platkin mostly declined to answer questions about the Montclair matter since he’s recused from it — Platkin lives in Montclair — and deferred questions about it to the unnamed person in his office who was or is handling that investigation. Platkin said he doesn’t know its status.
I don’t know why Spiller’s Democratic rivals — there are six Democrats in the race to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy — have not needled Spiller about this particular matter in advance of their June 10 primary. But the Montclair story is worth examining.
Spiller won election as the Montclair mayor in May 2020 after serving on the town’s council for two terms. The town had recently joined the State Health Benefits Program, which since 2010 has barred part-time employees from receiving health benefits. Montclair’s mayor and council members are part-time employees but were given the green light to receive health benefits because a town official said they worked the requisite 35 hours a week, according to allegations raised in court by Padmaja Rao, the town’s CFO.
Rao alleged in a 2022 whistleblower lawsuit that an outside auditor told her Montclair’s officials could not accept health benefits per state law, and when she told other town officials this, she became the victim of harassment.
Spiller did not accept most of Montclair’s health benefits, but he did sign up for its dental plan and take about $5,000 annually from Montclair taxpayers in exchange for not taking medical benefits, according to Rao’s lawyers. The $5,000 waiver is intended to encourage town employees to save taxpayers money by, say, remaining on their spouse’s health plan — not to fatten the wallet of its already well-paid mayor. The New Jersey Education Association’s IRS filings show Spiller’s 2022 salary was $291,289, plus $106,217 in other compensation.
Like Testa, Nancy Erika Smith, Rao’s attorney, is curious about why the ex-Wildwood mayor was charged with a crime but no one in Montclair was.
“I don’t know what the excuse is,” Smith said.
Smith noted that Montclair elected officials, including Spiller, signed certifications swearing under oath they worked 35 hours a week so they could qualify for benefits or the $5,000 waiver. Spiller also worked 40 hours a week for the teachers union, per the union’s IRS filings, meaning he was clocking 75-hour work weeks. Busy guy!
During Spiller’s deposition in the Rao case, Smith asked Spiller how long he worked per week, but Spiller cited his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself — and proceeded to plead the fifth more than 400 more times during that deposition.
 A portion of former Montclair Mayor Sean Spiller’s January 2024 deposition in a whistleblower lawsuit filed by the town’s CFO.
I asked Spiller’s campaign if he would chat with me about this. It sent a statement from Spiller trashing Testa’s comments to Platkin as “yet another MAGA fueled diatribe in Trenton” and said his assertions and those by “an interested attorney have no bearing on the facts.”
(Testa’s response: “Thou doth protest too much.”)
I also asked if Spiller would move to change the law if elected governor to allow part-time public workers like elected officials to collect health benefits. They are denied benefits under a 2010 law, championed by then-Gov. Chris Christie, who said it would lower costs for taxpayers.
“I have always stood for, and run on, Healthcare as a right for everyone and not a privilege,” Spiller’s statement says. “With countless folks and their town and county legal counsel all over the state — including Essex County — working to interpret current law, we need a Governor who will fight for universal Healthcare for every New Jersey resident. And that’s exactly what I’ll do.”
Awfully slippery. The question was about part-time mayors foisting the cost of their health benefits onto taxpayers even if they have full-time jobs that could provide those benefits, and the answer was a progressive call for universal health care. Spiller would fit in well in Trenton.
As for Peter Byron, the former Wildwood mayor, he admitted in September that he defrauded the State Health Benefits Program, among other crimes. Prosecutors with the state Attorney General’s Office recommended a three-year prison term. Rao settled her whistleblower lawsuit with Montclair last May for $1.25 million. And Spiller declined last year to seek a second term as Montclair’s mayor.

Together, let’s create a Vermont where every corner of our state reflects the security, respect and opportunity we all deserve.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Commissioner Jennifer Morrison: Public safety in Vermont requires rebalancing priorities.","This commentary is by Jennifer Morrison, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Safety.Last fall, Vermonters delivered a clear message: They want meaningful change on the issues impacting their daily lives: property taxes, education, housing and affordability. One common concern unites all these challenges: the need to ensure the safety of our communities, downtowns, neighborhoods and personal property.I have spent nearly 35 years living and working in Vermont — not only as your commissioner of public safety but also as a mother, coach, neighbor, police officer and policy advisor. My commitment to vibrant, attractive and safe communities runs deep. Yet many of our communities face significant public health and safety challenges that threaten our shared way of life.When I reflect on what I’m hearing and seeing across the state, I think about a pendulum that has swung too far in one direction and needs to be rebalanced. On one end is an overly punitive system that can overlook the potential for rehabilitation and the rights of individuals. On the other end is an approach so lenient that repeat offenders aren’t held accountable for the harm they inflict on our communities. Today, our policies have drifted too far toward leniency, and the damage — measured in undermined trust, diminished social cohesion and degraded public spaces — can no longer be ignored.Gov. Phil Scott’s proposed omnibus public safety bill takes a common-sense, measured approach to restoring balance. It recognizes the close ties between public health and public safety and tackles substance use, mental health and community well-being all at once. Healthy individuals build stronger families, and strong families support thriving schools. Safe neighborhoods attract residents and visitors, fueling local businesses and energizing our downtowns. In short, these efforts create a foundation for a robust, resilient community.Over the past two years, we’ve worked productively with the Legislature to address persistent problems. Now, we must build on that partnership by providing the right tools to hold a small number of individuals accountable — those whose repeated actions disproportionately damage local businesses, neighborhoods, and public spaces. Our proposals include common-sense reforms:Enhanced accountability: Bail revocation for repeat offenders and improved pre-trial supervision ensure that those who repeatedly harm our communities face timely and proportionate consequences.Fair treatment for adults: Repealing policies like “raise the age” reaffirms that adults must be held to the full standards of accountability under our laws.Balanced intervention: Ending “catch-and-release” practices and improving access to recovery and mental health services at critical intervention points ensure that our measures are both just and effective.These reforms are essential at a time when Vermont is facing rising drug trafficking, increased violent crime and the resultant uptick in gun violence and homicides. When serious offenders perceive our state as a soft target, our communities bear the cost — and that must stop.READ MORE

At the heart of these reforms lies our shared social contract. This contract is the unspoken agreement that binds us as Vermonters: It represents our mutual commitment to support one another, hold each other accountable, and ensure that our rights come with responsibilities. It promises that our communities will be safe havens where every individual — whether a resident, a visitor or someone seeking help — can thrive. Our proposed measures aim to renew that contract. They are not merely punitive steps but a balanced response that combines accountability with compassion, enforcement with opportunities for rehabilitation.By reaffirming our commitment to the social contract, we are pledging to safeguard our parks, neighborhoods and downtowns — not only as spaces of economic opportunity but as symbols of our collective trust and responsibility. When every individual knows that their actions have consequences and that our community will stand by those in need, we create a foundation for a safer, healthier and more vibrant Vermont.We owe Vermonters our best efforts to uphold this promise. By enacting these measures, we can recalibrate our approach to public safety and renew the social contract that underpins our shared quality of life.

If Gov. Scott wasn’t willing to act based on the directive of current state law, it’s difficult to trust that a new law would compel him to do so.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen. Anne Watson: A response to Sec. Moore’s commentary on the Global Warming Solutions Act.","This commentary is by Sen. Anne Watson, D/P-Washington. She is chair of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy.In a recent op-ed about the Global Warming Solutions Act, Vermont’s cornerstone climate policy, Sec. Julie Moore accused legislative leadership of being “content” with “unattainable” climate pollution reduction requirements. As chair of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy, I feel compelled to respond, as I would not describe us as “content” with the current situation. Earlier this year, I presented the administration with a potential path forward — an offer that still stands. But before I get into the details, let’s clarify one important point. The next major GWSA deadline isn’t tomorrow. It’s in 2030 — five years from now. Five years to act. Five years to take meaningful steps toward reducing climate pollution, which will ultimately save Vermonters a significant amount of money. Unfortunately, based on the pattern we’ve seen, I don’t believe Gov. Scott will do what’s necessary. Instead, he’ll continue to do what he has done on climate: stall, resist and let the Legislature do the heavy lifting — only to blame us when we propose real solutions that would lead Vermont toward a cheaper, more sustainable and resilient energy future.I’m interested in solutions, and I believe Vermonters are too. It’s unclear to me, though, how interested the governor is in finding solutions. By 2030, Gov. Scott will have had an entire decade to implement policies to meet our climate targets. While I recognize and appreciate his support for the clean cars and trucks rules, that alone falls short of what this moment demands.Unfortunately, it remains unclear what further policies the governor is actually willing to support. The governor’s package of climate rollbacks (H.289) requires an “implementation strategy” for reducing climate pollution — but it’s not due until December 2026, after this biennium is over and, conveniently, after the next election.READ MORE





 


Sec. Julie Moore: The road to lasting climate progress 

by Opinion 
March 23, 2025, 7:02 amMarch 21, 2025, 10:03 am 



Just to clarify, the governor doesn’t need a new bill to make an implementation plan. We already have an actual law: the Global Warming Solutions Act. If Scott wasn’t willing to act based on the directive of current state law, it’s difficult to trust that a new law would compel him to do so. That’s why I proposed the following path forward.First, the governor must identify and commit to a real strategy, something that moves us meaningfully and substantially toward the 2030 pollution reduction requirement, something that gets Vermonters to the cheaper, more price-stable, more self-sufficient and resilient future that we all want.Second, the Governor should roll it out and start implementation in 2026 or 2027. Third, prove to us it’s working in 2027 or 2028. Then, and only then, we can talk about recalibrating the timeline, choosing a slightly delayed deadline year with a pollution reduction requirement that follows the curve downward, which would maintain accountability.This offer remains, but the first step must come from the governor. If he has a substantive, meaningful plan for getting Vermont back on track, I’m ready to listen and work together. For the vast majority of cases, the renewable option is cheaper than its fossil fuel alternative. If Gov. Scott were serious about energy affordability, he’d be finding a way to transition Vermonters off of expensive, price-volatile, foreign fossil fuels.What’s concerning is the governor’s continued pattern of resistance and a lack of initiative, even as energy costs fluctuate and the need to transition off fossil fuels becomes more urgent. This moment calls for leadership that embraces both the financial and scientific realities before us.The affordable, resilient energy future Vermonters need is within reach, but only if we’re willing to take bold, concrete steps. Gov. Scott, Vermont needs you to bring forward a serious, actionable climate plan that gets us back on track toward necessary climate pollution reductions, that gets us back on the path toward energy affordability.If you do, I’ll be the first to recognize and support that effort. But in the absence of such a plan, we must stay the course for the 2030 deadline.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen. Anne Watson: A response to Sec.

Sanchez so far is the only candidate for land commissioner in the 2026 election. Voters twice sent current Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard to the State Land Office, and so the state constitution term-limits her from running again. She is instead seeking the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor, the Los Alamos Daily Post reports.
A former natural resource specialist for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and consultant for the New Mexico Acequia Commission, Sanchez also is a former vice chair of the Democratic Party of New Mexico, and worked as political director for U.S. Sen.

“I’m a 13th-generation New Mexican,” Sanchez said. “I learned to start caring for the land at a very young age, from my grandfather, who was a rancher, and just like his father and his father before them, all on the same piece of property in northern Socorro County. I’m really proud of the experience I’ve accumulated, and the people I’ve met because I learned so much from our elders, and want to continue a legacy of managing land in New Mexico for generations to come.”
The following interview has been edited for clarity and concision.
Source NM: Can you talk about equitable access to state lands? What does that mean to you, and why is it a priority for your campaign?
Juan Sanchez: We live in a place where the State Land Office manages over 9 million acres of public lands, and the other 13 million acres of mineral rights as well. But of those 9 million acres, there’s 1 million of them that are landlocked and are not accessible to the public. As someone who takes a lot of pride in accessibility to the outdoors and making sure folks in communities around the state can go and enjoy those areas, it’s something I plan to make a priority. We live in a beautiful place to go out, explore and learn about the land and our culture. But also, there’s opportunities with the outdoor economy, as well: teaching our young students and our young children in our schools about these lands and creating equitable access, and being able to open up these lands to all these different folks is definitely a priority.
 
Your campaign website talks about ensuring rural and Indigenous communities have a voice in land use decisions. What does that mean for people who don’t understand what land use is, and how will you ensure it ?
That’s something I’d like to build on from Land Commissioner [Garcia Richard], who I think has done a great job in creating the Cultural Resources Office. They’re going into these communities and finding out what makes them special or sacred. Some of these areas definitely do need some protection.
A great example of this is the Caja Del Rio up in Santa Fe County, which the current land commissioner has protected from mineral exploration, oil and gas, as well as large transmission. She was in consultation with tribal communities, with traditional Hispanic communities that have been there for centuries, and learning about how sacred and important that land is to the way of life.
 
Looking at Garcia Richard’s time in office, is there anything else you would continue?
The Cultural Resources office is absolutely one of those; the other one is the Office of Renewable Energy, she created that, and then it was put into statute a couple years later by the Legislature. The Cultural Resources Office has not been put into statute yet, so the next commissioner can decide whether or not to keep that or no longer have that. With the Office of Renewable Energy, continuing to try to expand and diversify some of the money we make off our state lands is something that will be important to me.
It’s important to maintain a relationship with the oil and gas industries. They are the revenue that comes from our state lands, predominantly. I appreciate the most recent work that was done this last legislative session, the royalty rate increase; that’s something I support. I think it’ll be great for New Mexicans and for our public institutions.
 
Is there anything you would do differently?
A lot of the work at the Surface Resource Division is something I’d really like to expand upon, make my own and try to find ways to diversify our economy through outdoor recreation and accessibility to lands, whether that be hiking, hunting or fishing. We have communities like our tribal and historical land use Hispanic communities that have been collecting wood in these areas for keeping their homes warm.
 
What does the phrase ‘water is life’ mean to you, both as a new Mexican and as a candidate for this role?
I’m a content creator and I have about 100,000 followers on my social media. Just this morning, I posted about how, when I was on a run yesterday, I was running along one of our acequias, and the water just started coming through for the first time in the year. You could actually watch the water pouring in. Look, I spent about five years as a consultant with the New Mexico Acequia Commission, working with leaders across the state, predominantly in Northern New Mexico, maintaining water access and traditional way of lives. Whenever we talk about our acequias, our water, we’re talking about the life blood to our lands and to our life. As the waters start pouring through our acequias, they start to grow in our fields, they start to feed our plants, they start to give water to the animals we end up eating later on. It’s a balance.
Our communities cannot survive without clean water, and I’m really adamant about the idea of protecting that and protecting the ways of life, learning from our tribal and our historical communities on how they’ve survived with scarcity of water, and finding ways to continue to protect it, for us and for future generations.

Mike Braun, left, and Commerce Secretary David Adams on April 24, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Following an explosive news report regarding a state economic development affiliate earlier this week, Gov. Mike Braun announced Thursday that funding for Elevate Ventures has been frozen and state government will conduct a forensic audit of the Indiana Economic Development Corp.
“What we’re talking about today originated in the prior administration (and) was brought to our attention,” said Braun, referencing the report from Indiana Legislative Insight. 
“I have directed the hiring of an independent forensic auditor of the IEDC and its affiliated entities. Where we have found impropriety — or even the appearance of it — we have reported it to the inspector general,” he continued.

The story unearthed allegations of self-dealing, unreported side gigs for employed IEDC staff and questions about potential conflicts of interest impacting tens of millions of dollars in economic development deals. 
Regarding Elevate Ventures, an economic development affiliate and venture capital firm, allegations include imprecise accounting, questionable staff compensation and not returning unspent funds to the state’s general fund.
In a statement, Elevate CEO Christopher Day pushed back.
“Elevate Ventures was established 15 years ago to serve the entrepreneur and innovation ecosystem in Indiana through venture development services and venture capital investments. We will continue to operate with transparency and are eager to participate in the forensic audit as directed by the Governor to correct the record on factual inaccuracies and misrepresentations made by anonymous sources.”
Braun emphasized that the administration is not “rushing to any conclusions,” though some of the concerns stem from an executive order he signed earlier this month. Under the rule, state-affiliated nonprofits would need to disclose their funders, including the IEDC’s companion foundation. 
Previously, that entity didn’t have to publicize such information because it had an exemption from the federal government. Those “missing audited financials” have now been shared with the State Budget Committee, Braun said. 
The process for hiring a firm for an independent audit is ongoing, said Commerce Secretary David Adams, and will be paid for by IEDC funds. Once a firm is selected, Adams said the audit could take up to a year. 
“The current funds that have been designated for Elevate Ventures are now frozen. That includes a second tranche of funds from the (State Small Business Credit Initiative). We are going to place those funds on hold until further evaluation,” said Adams.
The latter fund is a federal program. 
Adams also said that the IEDC’s foundation will not “expend any additional dollars at this point.” The foundation has accepted money from business in the state for years and used it to fund international trade missions. But they have declined to give specifics on donors and expenses.
More details
Also in question is whether other affiliates will get caught up in the probe. 
“We don’t know … that’s the intent of hiring an independent, national firm to come in and do an audit of all of this to help understand if there are issues — and there may not be issues,” said Adams. “But we thought, instead of trying to do this on a piecemeal basis, the appropriate action to take is … (to) look at everything comprehensively.”
Adams said there have been “no issues” raised from the entity’s financial audits in the past, but that “a forensic audit is a very different type of audit.”
A little-known nonprofit boosts Indiana’s economic development agency

“This is looking beyond the financials, but is looking beyond the financials into specific transactions as well as processes.”
The IEDC was created as a public-private entity under former Gov. Mitch Daniels but became a major target for scrutiny in the last election cycle, including criticism from Braun. 
In particular, both the LEAP district in Lebanon and a SK hynix project in West Lafayette — projects worth billions of dollars that launched under the direction of former Gov. Eric Holcomb — have encountered local opposition. 
But such an audit should have “no impact” on ongoing projects, said Adams — though he acknowledged that competing states may use the audit to leverage potential bids away from Indiana.
“I do want to say that the IEDC plays a critically important role in this state. It’s a strong agency. We help Indiana businesses grow. We help attract businesses here, from entrepreneurs to large organizations,” said Adams. “We are going to bring transparency to this agency and its partners and it’s going to make us overall much stronger.”
But the agency got a 25% cut in the most recent version of the budget, which strikes funding for deal closing and other line items. Adams, however, didn’t tie those eliminated dollars to the IEDC’s performance, but rather the state’s $2.4 billion projected shortfall. 
“But we’re also looking at efficiencies and where are things that we can do to help it really be a more effective agency,” said Adams. “… we’re going to reshape the IEDC to support (regional economic development) in a very different way than we have in the past.”

(Photo by Briana Michel/Florida Phoenix)No one should be surprised by Gov. Ron DeSantis’ announcement that the state DOGE taskforce intends to dig into the finances of Florida’s public colleges and universities, pore over years of research, and decide what is kosher and what needs to be jettisoned.
It’s the beginning of a new round of aggression by DeSantis, designed to mortally wound universities as we have known them and rid the state of these supposed hotbeds of liberalism.
The arrogance is stunning. This man, who admits he knew nothing about DEI until a couple of years ago, and who has never shown a glimpse of intellectual discernment, is now the self-appointed curator of Florida’s higher education.
“There’s certain state policies that have been implemented, such as the abolition of DEI, which I know on a superficial level the universities went and applied with,” DeSantis said.
“But as we’ve seen, you know, you kind of burrow in and rename, do what you want. And there is some sense in some quarters that whatever the law in the state of Florida is, it just is not obligatory on them, and they can kind of do their own little fiefdom. That’s not going to fly here.”
DeSantis has it in for these institutions, as have many extremist conservatives who despise education and the educated, harboring a deep loathing of learning any ideas of which they disapprove.
Although he pretends otherwise, DeSantis, conservative ideologue Christopher Rufo, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, and others know that education has always been an antidote to authoritarianism, which is why they are fighting so hard. They are resisting the diversity that the Civil Rights movement, the women’s movement, and LGBTQ-rights movement engendered.
‘The professors are the enemy’
The DeSantis blitzkrieg through higher education has include book bans and removing women’s studies, African American history, and critical race theory from university curricula. He hijacked New College of Florida, purged it’s courses of “liberal” topics, forced dissenters to flee or be silent, and tossed books into dumpsters.
As a part of his audit, DeSantis is demanding that universities provide information about researchers — including names, job titles, salaries, and details of their work, Newsweek reports.
He says the state seeks to “identify, review, and report on unnecessary spending, programs, courses, staff, and any other inefficiencies.”
DeSantis isn’t operating in a vacuum. The assault on universities and institutions of higher learning has been carefully choreographed by the Heritage Foundation, the Republican Party, archconservatives, and MAGA.
Vice President J.D. Vance captures the animus Republicans in general have towards education and educational institutions. Vance said during a speech: “There is a wisdom in what Richard Nixon said approximately 40 to 50 years ago. He said, and I quote, ‘The professors are the enemy.'”
DeSantis, by his actions, is no different. His war on academia has so far only been checked by the courts.
Republicans’ aggressive approach is an effort to reshape education in consequential and permanent ways. They want to shift the ideological tilt of a higher education system which they regard as profoundly hostile to conservatives. The Trump administration has several universities in its crosshairs, threatening billions of dollars in federal contracts and grants. They include the University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, Cornell University, and Northwestern, stripping them of federal contracts and research grants; demanding control over hiring and the authority to oversee university operations.

 Harvard’s example
Floridians could look to the example of Harvard University in refusing to obey Trump’s directives and moves toward a mutual defense compact being organized among faculty at 18 Big Ten universities.
Yi-Li Wu, associate professor of History and Gender Studies at the University of Michigan said during a recent faculty meeting that the United States is on the cusp of authoritarianism and that everyone must look at themselves in the mirror and determine what they will do as democratic institutions like higher education are attacked.
Neither silence nor compliance are survival strategies, Wu added, noting that Columbia University, which has hundreds of millions of dollars pulled and several pro-Palestinian students arrested, is a prime example of the reality that compromising on core values will not save schools from Trump’s wrath.
Prof. Jason Stanley, a former Yale University philosophy professor, says the war on universities is straight out of an authoritarian playbook. Throughout history, he said, the rise of authoritarian regimes has coincided with attacks on intellectuals — and efforts to discredit the institutions they’re associated with — in concert with the scapegoating of marginalized groups.
Authoritarians view universities — vital centers of critical thought and free expression — as an innate threat to their desire for complete subservience, Stanley said.
“The universities, not because of ideological indoctrination but because they contain a lot of young smart people called students, have always been the source of resistance against authoritarianism and unjust war,” he said.
The “leaders” of Florida’s colleges and universities have shown no backbone or a willingness to resist DeSantis’ bullying. But those concerned about his onslaughts must fight back fiercely.
 Boycott
Resisting should be a slam dunk.
Florida’s colleges and universities should be protecting their cherished traditions, as well as their diverse student populations, from these ideological thugs. And if they are content to cower in the corner, the people must take the fight to DeSantis and the rest of them.
They hope that by instilling fear in people, they won’t fight back. But there is too much at stake not to oppose these people at every turn.
Journalist and author Joy Ann Reid told Dr. Christina Greer, a political scientist, during a recent Zoom discussion organized by Fair Fight Georgia, that education triggers rebellion, adding that a grassroots political uprising is necessary to fight against what she described as “a toxic, noxious, lawless political party.”
“Well, you know, as a university professor, the university is a space for intellectual ideas and debates. We cannot have a space where it’s filled with fear and silence.” Greer told Juan Gonzalez on ‘Democracy Now.’
“I think universities have to band together. This is the — what is the point of an endowment if during hard times you’re not going to use it?
“We know that there are some universities that are larger, more powerful than others. If they stick together — collective action, which is what I talk about in all of my books — you can actually get a lot more than sort of being picked off one by one … time and time in America, if you know your history. You know, as you target one group, many groups don’t ever think that they’ll be targeted. And it’s like, your day will come.”
Reid agreed.
“A generation from now, you won’t have enough people aware of history to fight back. Don’t be like Columbia and get on your knees,” she warned. “Join a compact, send your children to a state where they are protecting people. Don’t go to states like Florida.”
Economic boycotts are effective tools, Reid said. “Don’t buy from stores who gave to Trump. Reward people who are fighting back, unsubscribe from newspapers, don’t buy Tesla.”

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)If there is one thing we have seen a lot of during Gov. Mike Braun’s first 100 days, it’s executive orders: 63 of them, to be exact.
If you are keeping track, that’s already more than the 56 former Gov. Mike Pence issued across his four-year term.
And it’s on the way to exceeding totals from former Govs. Eric Holcomb and Mitch Daniels, who both served eight years.
Holcomb issued 164 executive orders in all, though around half dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic. Daniels issued 175, with many being pardons for convicted Hoosiers; the issuance of pardons has dropped significantly since Indiana adopted an expungement statute.
Braun and Daniels have one thing in common — using executive orders in the first year to try to reshape state government.
Daniels took over in 2005, after 16 years of Democrats in the governor’s office.
His first 20 executive orders were significant alterations. One took away the right of state employees to collectively bargain; another required the Indiana Department of Administration to post written state contracts online; others created the Indiana Department of Child Services and the Office of Inspector General. Many of those had immediate impacts that Hoosiers could see.
How Braun is using the tool
Braun has done the same, even though Republicans have controlled all of state government since 2011. You would think that would mean fewer changes, but apparently not.
He used executive orders in the first few weeks to establish his new cabinet structure and to require state employees to return to work in the office, rather than working remotely. But he has also used many orders to simply draw attention to priorities.
And then there is the nationalization of federal politics. For instance, Braun declared there are just two genders, male and female, and eliminated state diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts.
“The tone of state politics has shifted with this polarization,” said Michael Wolf, a political science professor at Purdue University Fort Wayne. He noted that Braun’s order switching DEI to MEI — merit, excellence and innovation came just before President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
“(It) received a ton of national media attention — and it was straight from the hymnal book that is popular with the Republican chorus,” Wolf continued. “That’s not to question how genuine those beliefs are, it is just noteworthy that this theme has been so important in the national narrative and Braun was able to be right out front with the executive order, where legislation would have taken considerably longer.”

Braun also has ordered various studies on topics such as employment best practices, diet-related chronic disease, and laws and policies that disincentivize marriage.
Just this week, the governor added two more executive orders to develop a statewide water planning framework and create a body to investigate the recovery of rare earth elements from Hoosier coal sites.
Elizabeth Bennion, chancellor’s professor of political science at Indiana University South Bend, noted governors usually use executive orders to “circumvent” the Legislature or “in response to delegation from” the Legislature” — but said “neither of these seems to be the major reason that the Braun administration is issuing executive orders.”
“Instead, the governor seems to be responding to expectations of policy leadership,” Bennion said. “These expectations are, to a large degree, self-created through his own desire to lead the state in a specific policy direction and his promises on the campaign trail.”
She added that the substantive impact of the orders is not yet known.
Wolf observed that Indiana is one of only a handful of states that has no constitutional or political tradition of legislative oversight of executive orders.
“Hoosier governors can reorganize government through executive order and have no formal provisions restricting the use of EOs, where many or most other states have some restrictions by procedure or by legislative check,” he said. “Even the structure of the cabinet system is based on gubernatorial power and not derived from the Constitution or statute.”
Executive orders themselves aren’t a bad thing, but the increasing reliance on them is something to keep an eye on.
Braun is using them heavily to score political points. At this pace, he will blow by his predecessors.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Northfield residents turn out to support police chief who has allegedly faced racism, harassment.","Northfield Police Chief Pierre Gomez speaks with residents at a selectboard meeting on Tuesday, April 22. Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerNORTHFIELD — More than a dozen Northfield residents spoke out in support of the town’s first Black police chief this week, denouncing racial discrimination he has allegedly faced and town officials’ failure to support him.“Things are happening and things need to be exposed,” Chief Pierre Gomez said during a brief phone interview Tuesday when asked about racism he has allegedly faced since accepting the job. But he declined to comment further, he said, “due to pending litigation.”Gomez was hired in September 2023 as chief of police in this Washington County town of about 5,900 — home to Norwich University — after former chief of police John Helfant retired amid controversy in May 2023.On Tuesday night, more than 60 residents packed the selectboard meeting held at the Brown Public Library in a show of solidarity. Many spoke in support of Gomez, condemned racism and called on the board to be more inclusive and transparent. Several responded to a racist remark made at the April 8 selectboard meeting, where Lynn Doney, a disgraced former selectman who worked as a deputy sheriff and EMT in Washington County, took issue with Gomez wearing a grey hoodie on duty instead of wearing his uniform, “so he looks like a police chief and not a gangster off the street that’s just driving our cruisers around,” he said.Doney was interrupted by selectboard member Merry Shernock, who said she didn’t think Gomez looked like a gangster and that police officers don’t always have to be in uniform.“I think he follows every regulation to the letter possible,” she said in the back and forth that ensued.Doney did not respond to a call for comment.More than a dozen residents wore hoodies to the selectboard meeting Tuesday in solidarity with Gomez, who was also present and wearing a grey hooded sweatshirt in the back of the room. Some who spoke at the meeting said his hoodie makes him more relatable to younger people in town at a time when there is division around law enforcement issues.Residents who spoke during the 45-minute public comment period called for greater understanding, kindness and inclusion.“This is not about one person or one statement,” Sarah Path said. “It is about the message that is sent to the community when such statements go unchallenged. It is about speaking up about what was wrong, and empowering and encouraging others to do the same so that we can all move forward with better understanding, kindness and respect.”A student condemns racism at a selectboard public hearing in Northfield on April 22. Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerStudents who spoke at the meeting said they felt comfortable wearing hoodies and that calling someone a gangster for wearing one is “unfair,” “wrong” and “racist.”A hoodie is “pretty much the basic top of Vermonters,” said resident Matthew Fedders. “So I did have to question when I heard that comment: what is different in my hoodie and the police chief’s? And sadly, all I can arrive on is his skin color,” he said.Mia Schultz, president of the Rutland Area NAACP, who spoke remotely via video at the meeting, indicated that Gomez has been facing discrimination in Northfield for a while.What Northfield is facing is a pattern, she said, that unfolds often in Vermont when a person of color is placed into a position of leadership in a predominantly white community. Rather than being welcomed and supported, leaders of color “are slowly and painfully undermined, not only through overt actions that we’re speaking of today, but often through inaction, through silence, through a refusal to stand up when it matters the most,” Schultz said.Several leaders of color across Vermont have left their positions, citing various degrees of discrimination in recent years. They include Esther Charlestin, then dean of climate and culture, leaving the Middlebury Union Middle School in 2023; the first equity directors, Yasamin Gordon in Winooski and Tyeastia Green in Burlington, leaving in 2022; Tabitha Moore quitting her leadership of the Rutland NAACP in 2021; and Rep. Kiah Morris, the state’s only Black woman legislator, resigning in 2018.Gomez took over as police chief when Northfield’s previous chief, Helfant, a white man, resigned after his policing background and anti-transgender comments were condemned by community members and groups who called for his resignation. He had served the town for four years.The NAACP sent a letter to Northfield Town Manager Jeff Schulz on April 13, which Schultz shared this week with VTDigger, titled “A Call for Unequivocal Support of Chief Gomez and a Safer, Stronger Northfield.”In his emailed response, the town manager wrote that Northfield “strives to be a welcoming and inclusive community” and has adopted “a statement of anti-racism and a declaration of inclusion.”Schultz responded on April 17 explaining she had asked for his personal stance on his police chief. “Not a town-wide initiative. Not a future meeting. A leadership decision—yours. From what I understand, that support has not been demonstrated publicly or privately,” she wrote.Schultz said in an interview she has not received a response. She reiterated at the meeting that town leadership needs to publicly back the chief for him to succeed in Northfield.Her comments spurred residents to question the board further and to demand transparency. “It sounds like there’s something bigger and that there’s more issues that I wasn’t even aware of,” said Shannon Doney, who said she is related by marriage to the former selectman. She demanded “​​some level of transparency” on how the board is planning to rectify the situation. “Because I think people would have come out and supported the chief a heck of a lot sooner if we were aware,” she said.Board members confirmed the town is investigating personnel issues related to bigotry beyond the April 8 comment but did not elaborate.In an interview with VTDigger Wednesday, Schulz said he supports all town employees, including the chief. But he declined to comment when asked if has publicly expressed support for Gomez.He said he could not speak to any personnel investigations or pending litigation. At the end of the lengthy public comment period, many residents stopped to chat and shake hands with Gomez, who said he was pleased to see the support but declined to further comment.Tuesday’s meeting also included an introductory DEI training session for the selectboard by Shalini Suryanarayana from the state Office of Racial Equity.Shalini Suryanarayana from the Vermont Office of Racial Equity gives an introductory DEI training session at the Northfield Selectboard meeting on April 22, 2025. Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerKatie Whitney, a town resident who said she has worked closely with Suryanarayana on equity issues, said the community can do better and voiced support for the police chief. “My family stands with you. And it is not on you to be the change. We must be the change,” she said.The state’s demographics are challenging, Whitney said, with non-white people making up about 4% of Vermont’s population, including just 1.2% who identify as Black or African American.

Long time Missouri sports reporter, Vahe Gregorian, wrote a moving and nostalgic piece in The Kansas City Star about the Royals, their cherished place in our collective identity, and their desire to build a baseball park downtown.
The emotional pull is undeniable. As a transplant to Kansas City, I marveled in 2015 at the pictures and stories on social media of friends and neighbors who attended the Royals 1985 World Series with their parents then doing the same with their own children. Even as I write this, it remains a powerful example of how professional sports can bring a community together.
Yet there are plenty of Kansas Citians who are just as emotionally moved to protect Kauffman Stadium itself, the place of both the team’s Series wins. The K is often rated highly among MLB parks, which doesn’t include the strong affinity Royals fans have for Ewing Kauffman himself. The park itself holds emotional and cultural value.
But the effort to use taxpayer money to build a downtown park is not a romance novel, it is a business proposal. It ought to be understood as such.
Royals owner John Sherman certainly understands it as a business deal. In a recent radio interview, Sherman said the team needs a newer building, a modern building, because the K was, “not competitive.” What does that mean? According to, “The Business of Sports,” edited by Scott Rosner and Kenneth Shropshire, “Much of the reason why existing stadiums are considered ‘obsolete’ is because they lack enough high-priced corporate seating,” such as luxury boxes and club seats which businesses may purchase and claim as tax deductions.
Nothing romantic there.
In turn, proponents of a downtown stadium offer smoke-and-mirrors arguments about all the economic benefits of a downtown stadium. At best, moving the park downtown changes spending—it does not create new spending. Where fans once may have visited liquor and grocery stores on their way to the K, they would now spend those same dollars at the new park and adjacent restaurants and bars.
That’s not new money for the city or county. Quite the opposite, because current spending goes to places whose sales, income and property taxes support vital public services. But the subsidy regime for a new park would mean taxes collected at or around the new park would be returned to the developer for decades.
Gregorian cites the resuscitation of downtown by the Power & Light District as an example of economic success. It is anything but. The city did not create new economic activity, it merely redirected it from elsewhere, and in doing so, forwent millions in tax revenue. If downtown is considered a success, why are we still discussing new subsidies there 20 years later? When do taxpayers get to claim success and move on?
As for the April 2024 campaign, Gregorian quotes Royals owner John Sherman lamenting that the team did not have enough time to put together a sound proposal for the East Crossroads location. Recall, however, that Jackson County Executive Frank White vetoed putting the vote on the April 2 ballot and was initially supported by county legislators. But an ad campaign by the Chiefs and Royals pressured legislators to override White, which they did. If Sherman regrets the short campaign, he has only himself to blame.
Perhaps most unsettling is Gregorian’s mention that Sherman has been a substantial philanthropist for city causes. His generosity is welcome and laudable. It is a credit to Sherman himself. Yet the message seems to be, as it has for other wealthy Kansas Citians seeking public subsidies, that taxpayers somehow owe them.
That is not charity; it is quid pro quo.
The Royals are culturally important to Kansas City. And we love our teams. But Kansas Citians must be clear-eyed about what is being asked of them: billions of dollars to move a park six miles so already-wealthy business owners can earn even more.
There is nothing romantic or nostalgic about that.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GGPi0Y2WwAAS-mt-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-04-25 07:01:13.854177

Gov. Sara Rodriguez and state Sens. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi) and Brad Pfaff (D-Onalaska) listen to community members at an April 24 roundtable in Richland Center. (Hery Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)RICHLAND CENTER — In a 90-minute roundtable meeting at the Richland Center community center Thursday, President Donald Trump’s name was mentioned just twice. But community leaders highlighted how his administration’s policies are already wreaking havoc on the county with the sixth highest poverty rate in the state. 
About 15 area leaders representing small business owners, farmers, schools, hospitals and community advocacy groups met Thursday with state Sens. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi) and Brad Pfaff (D-Onalaska) and Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez. Throughout the event, the attendees discussed how the policies and plans of Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress to cut or diminish Medicaid, Social Security and education funding while instituting widespread tariffs on imported goods from countries around the world and making it harder for migrant workers to obtain visas could decimate their region. 
“None of this is right. Where I’m at that age in my life where I don’t get more thoughtful, I get more pissed,” Brett White, executive director of the Southwestern Wisconsin Community Action Program, said. “And because this is all not necessary, this is completely unnecessary, which means that it’s intentional.” 
The group noted repeatedly that a cut to programs in one area had a ripple effect across every other community institution. 
White, and Chris Frakes, the organization’s senior director, said that the cuts to Head Start early childhood education programming that have already come and are set to deepen under Trump are their biggest worry. 
There are currently about 70 kids in Richland County enrolled in Southwest CAP’s Head Start program, according to Frakes. If those programs are lost, poor kids in Richland County will never catch up, she said. 
“Because we know if you enter kindergarten already behind, there’s virtually no chance to catch up by third grade,” Frakes said. “If you’re not on grade level reading in third grade, we know your life prospects go down dramatically, right? So Head Start fills this critical, vital need to get those kiddos onto par with their middle class peers when they hit kindergarten, so that they are ready to learn, and their families have the sort of surrounding supports, whether that’s food, whether that’s access to transportation, for medical care.” 
If Head Start gets cut, the children who are affected will eventually reach Aaron Mithum, the middle and high school principal for the Kickapoo Area School District. Mithum says the district is “waiting for the other shoe to drop” on the future of the approximately $800,000 it gets annually from the federal government as Trump seeks to shut down the U.S. Department of Education. 
If Head Start leaves poor kids behind before they turn five, by the time they reach Mithum at a middle school that’s also struggling financially, there won’t be many options. 
“We’re getting them when they get into pre K or kindergarten, and now we’re trying to go from there, and now, all of a sudden, they don’t have any of that foundational aspect,” Mithum said. “It’s a building block, trickle effect, and not in a positive way. So now it’s that much harder for us to do what [Head Start wasn’t] able to do, and it continues to go up. And it’s just really hard to think about, what does that look like? What does that look like to be a parent with a special ed kid who needs speech services or reading services, or whatever. And the answer is, sorry, not our problem.” 
While the child care and education system of a community that’s already seen the closure of its local University of Wisconsin campus faces the prospect of being unable to keep poor kids from falling behind, the area’s food system is also being hit. 
Retaliatory tariffs on the area’s wheat, corn and soybean farmers are hurting their ability to find international markets for their products while tariffs imposed by Trump have made fertilizer and machinery more expensive, said Sally Leong, Wisconsin Farmers Union member and former professor of plant pathology at UW-Madison. 
Those struggles are continuing to push up the price of food, causing local families to rely on food pantries more than used to, according to Jackie Anderson, executive director of Feeding Wisconsin. 
Under Trump, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) paused funding for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), which Anderson said has amounted to about a 30% cut to what food banks are able to buy. USDA has also ended a program that connected local farms with food pantries to supply fresh produce. 
“Food banks are really looking at the bottom line and saying, like, ‘How are we going to be able to get that amount of food here?’” Anderson said. 
The tariffs are also affecting the companies providing jobs in the area. Marty Richards, the county tourism director, said that Rockwell Automation has delayed and cancelled orders because of Trump’s tariffs. Meanwhile it’s getting harder to find local workers and Trump’s restrictive immigration policies have made it nearly impossible to hire migrant workers. Richards said the company has had a hard time getting workers from its plant in Mexico to come to the U.S. even temporarily for technical training
Teri Richards, board member of the Greater Richland Area Chamber of Commerce, said the county desperately needs more people and she doesn’t know where to find them. 
“We’re obviously not having enough babies. We’re struggling to get that immigrant population and we can’t keep stealing from each other,” she said. “So it’s time to go into Chicago or Milwaukee, to even get a few of those folks moved out here? I don’t know.” 
With fewer people moving in and federal policies discouraging investment from the business community and cutting funds from schools and child care, the community is also facing the management of an aging population. About 30% of the population is older than 60 and 14% is disabled, according to Roxanne Klubertanz, manager of Richland County’s Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC). 
That aging population means the community is only going to become more reliant on federal programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Currently, the ADRC helps people in the community apply for Medicaid to pay for the services that will help them stay in their homes for as long as possible or move to an assisted living facility — currently a cost of about $3,800 per month, she said. 
Republicans in Congress are currently weighing a budget proposal that would slash Medicaid funding. Klubertanz said without the program people won’t be able to access those services and will ultimately get sicker and require a placement in a nursing home — a cost of about $10,000 per month. 
“So if that funding, that Medicaid funding, goes away, what’s going to happen?” she said. “Maybe right away, you’re going to see some decreases, but people are going to get sicker and need more services, and then they have to pay for that nursing home placement, which is almost three times the cost. So if you’re trying to fix something today, you have to think about what it’s gonna be like in five years. You’ve gotta have that long range thinking.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Montana’s now-senior senator, Steve Daines, was bubbling at the the post from Donald Trump offering him his “complete and total endorsement” for his re-election campaign.  
While there’s no doubt Daines has been living in the highly-confined atmosphere of the DC MAGA bubble, he might just want to check old Donald’s latest polls, approval levels, disapproval levels, and massive failures on the economic and international scene before he ties that particular anvil around his neck.
In short, this chaos-inducing president is setting new records alright — for the lowest approval ratings of any president in modern history at the 100-day level of his term.  Although this is supposed to be the “honeymoon” period for a new president, it’s fair to say the honeymoon is over for The Donald — and the American public is wondering what it’s going to take to get a divorce from “the world’s biggest clown and most economically incoherent president ever.” 
But hey, don’t take my word for it, how’s about some stats from “fair and balanced” Fox News on where their once-favorite president now stands according to their latest poll.  Simply put, Trump’s numbers are underwater and sinking fast with a new low of 38% approval, 56% disapproval on the economy; 33% to 59% disapproval on inflation; 33% to 58% disapproval on tariffs; 40% to 54% disapproval on foreign policy; 38% to 53% disapproval on taxes and even a 41% to 44% disapproval on guns. His dubious “high point,” on immigration, is 47% approve and 48% disapprove. As bad as they are, those rather shocking numbers coming from MAGA’s “safe” Fox News bunker aren’t as low as other polls.
Then there’s the rest of the world. 
As Canadian farmer Peter Hamilton summed it up: “The biggest thing in Canada is we have friends all over the world. How many friends does America have right now?” Seems the threats and rants have provided good reasons to find other trading partners — and let the U.S. go down its dead-end street of isolationism and protectionism.  
In short, China is laughing at us since the total exports to the U.S. were about 15% of their exports and are expected to drop by 77% in 2025.  Meanwhile, Chinese exports to North America (without the U.S.) are expected to surge by 25%.  No surprise to anyone except the White House that the rest of the world is more than happy to buy Chinese goods — from electric vehicles to just about everything else on the shelves these days. 
Closer to home, those same tariffs and attempts to paint our centuries-long friends in Canada as our enemies, are not making Montanans happy.  Blackfeet tribal members have already filed a lawsuit challenging the tariffs since “the Jay Treaty signed in 1794, ratified by Congress and signed into law by then-President George Washington, which exempted tribes along the United States-Canadian border from being taxed or levied on goods between the nations.”   
Now, the Montana Farmers Union has joined that lawsuit — which also challenges the president’s authority to impose tariffs since that right is constitutionally reserved to Congress.  When Montana’s farmers and ranchers can’t sell their grains and livestock all over the world there’s trouble with a capital “T” brewing under the Big Sky.
Daines may be thrilled that the bully on the playground claims to be his friend. But that might not work out so well when that bully is responsible for massive job losses, stocks crashing, retirement savings disappearing, and the inability for Montanans to sell goods abroad — especially with 19 more months of chaos and failures before the next election.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/trump-sheehy-31-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-25 07:01:13.854177

An Idaho health official announced the extension of the Family and Personal Care Services program at a Wednesday meeting of the Medicaid Advisory Committee. 
‘That impossible juggle:’ How Idaho parents of disabled kids are bracing for care program’s end

Federally approved during the pandemic as a way to reduce COVID’s spread and address a shortage in the typical disability caregiver workforce, Idaho’s federal waiver that allowed the program was set to expire in March.
In November, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced it would attempt to end the program earlier, saying fraud and abuse contributed to higher program costs and enrollment levels, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The Idaho health agency is still seeking to end the program.
But the federal agency that regulates Medicaid, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, recently extended the program, Idaho Medicaid Deputy Director Juliet Charron said at Wednesday’s meeting. Charron said Idaho’s request to end the program is awaiting CMS action as part of a broader package. 
CMS extended Idaho’s broader Medicaid waiver that allowed for the program while the agency evaluates the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare’s request to renew the waiver for five more years, state health agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Sun in an email. Idaho’s waiver extension request includes an amendment to end the family paid caregiver program, he said.

 Disability advocates, families worry kids needs won’t be met without program

Disability advocates and families who participate in the family caregiver program worry kids with disabilities couldn’t get the care services they need without the program, the Sun previously reported. Idaho has a shortage of direct care workers, the typical caregivers that work in relatively low-paid, demanding jobs, according to a watchdog report by the Idaho Office of Performance Evaluations. 
Nathan Hill, an Idaho disability advocate and paid caregiver for his son who has disabilities, told the Sun the program’s early termination would affect children and adults with disabilities who need help with day-to-day activities.
“With the years-long caregiver shortage, and Idaho having the worst caregiver shortage in the nation, it was intended for this program to be permanent,” Hill told the Sun in a text message. “Terminating the program puts Idaho in violation of the (federal Americans with Disabilities Act) by making care inaccessible to those who really need it.”
He also said CMS can’t issue decisions due to the Trump administration’s freeze on federal health communications. 
When Health and Welfare told reporters about the concerns, state health officials couldn’t immediately share estimates for how much fraud was confirmed or suspected. But an agency spokesperson has told the Sun fraud and abuse of the benefit has been confirmed.

State health officials have publicly released little information about the fraud and abuse claims, public records request responses reviewed by the Sun in January showed.
McWhorter said state health officials are still concerned about the program. He said more oversight is needed, which would require additional funding appropriations by the Idaho Legislature. 
The Idaho Legislature could have acted to extend the program in the 2025 legislative session, which ended in April. 
Early on in this year’s legislative session, Idaho Senate Health and Welfare Committee Chairwoman Juile VanOrden, R-Pingree, told the Sun that legislative moves to reinstate the program aren’t expected until 2026 as officials work on safeguards.

As the president seeks to log, mine, drill and develop, Yellowstone researcher Chris Servheen calls the administration's proposed policy ""management based on ignorance.""
The post Scientist who recovered grizzlies warns Trump’s assault on conservation risks irreversible losses appeared first on WyoFile .","In fewer than 100 days, the Trump administration has promoted drilling, mining and development of public lands while undercutting the science, scientists and laws that protect the environmental fabric of the West, conservationists say. The president maintains he is pursuing his agenda in the name of national security and a better life for Americans.
But the administration is sacrificing science and an American heritage on the altar of affluence, said the man most responsible for preserving a North American wildlife icon.
“Decisions on land management and wildlife management depend on science and facts,” said Chris Servheen, who for 35 years coordinated research and management of grizzly bears in the Lower 48, including their successful recovery in the Yellowstone ecosystem. He made his comments in an impassioned interview that centered on the species he spent a lifetime restoring.
“Without the study team and the Endangered Species Act, there would be no grizzly bears in the Yellowstone Ecosystem today.” Chris Servheen
Without science and scientists, “all the decisions we will make will not be informed,” he said. “It’ll be management based on ignorance, and that’s a losing approach.”
Servheen criticized the administration as Trump and his cabinet this week continued its attack on the conservation of natural resources, critics say. Trump on Easter Sunday called the country’s energy development “far too inadequate to meet our Nation’s needs,” and declared a national energy emergency that would dump environmental safeguards that hinder energy production.
His executive order follows the Bureau of Land Management’s plan to sideline conservation by rescinding the agency’s Public Lands Rule that would have put environmental sustainability on par with development. At the BLM’s parent Department of the Interior, a four-year draft strategic plan leaked to Public Domain and published Tuesday would “restore American prosperity” by using natural resources to lower energy costs and “increase … affordability.”
Biological research
Trump would eliminate the budget for biological research at the U.S. Geological Survey, the nation’s science research center, according to the journal Science. That federal research is the arena in which Servheen staked his career in public service.
Servheen and others are skeptical that the $307 million annual federal work in the Ecosystems Missions Area could be replaced by universities, as proposed in an internal USGS email that Science obtained. The agency’s targeted Biological Research Division involves cooperative research at 44 universities, including the University of Wyoming and tackles invasive species, climate-change-driven wildfires, chronic wasting disease that’s now infected numerous Wyoming winter elk feedgrounds, and similar threats.
“A management system based on ignorance … results in bad decisions and loss of resources,” Servheen said. “I don’t see how that’s a benefit to the American public. There certainly isn’t a benefit to me as a US taxpayer, and it’s not like, you know, my taxes are going to be reduced.”
Grizzly bear sign .(Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team)
Servheen pointed to his career as “Exhibit A” in his support for the federal research. The Grizzly Bear Study Team he led determined “where they live, what they ate, how they related to humans, how they related to each other [and] what were the main causes of mortality,” he said. The team determined the survival rate for cubs and females necessary to increase and stabilize the population, one of the country’s great wildlife success stories.
“Without the study team and the Endangered Species Act, there would be no grizzly bears in the Yellowstone Ecosystem today,” he said. “They would be gone.”
Yellowstone National Park, the world’s first national park set aside for enjoyment and preservation, would be diminished today had it not been for the federal research, he said.
Grizzly bears, still listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, are “the No. 1 species that people want to see in Yellowstone,” he said. “Hundreds of millions of dollars of tourist income flow into all the communities because of that interest.”
Why are grizzlies special?
“People ask me why grizzly bears are special,” Servheen said, “and I think [it’s] because they’re a magical animal.
“Years after I see a grizzly bear, or you see a grizzly bear, you can tell us what time of the day you saw it and what the bear was doing and what the weather was like, and who you’re with,” he said — “all burned into our memory.
“When we’re in grizzly habitat, we’re more aware or more alert, we have a more full experience of nature and wild nature. That’s what grizzly bears bring us.”

Servheen dismissed notions that genetic engineering, including the so-called resurrection of the extinct dire wolf, could fulfill the country’s desire to preserve species’ natural systems.
“The Endangered Species Act is to recover species that need assistance,” Servheen said. “It’s not to create genetic models of them and put them in zoos.”
The law is popular, Servheen said. “The majority of the public likes that idea.”
But in Trump’s beltway and Mar-a-Lago Club orbit, “there’s no interest in the maintenance of natural systems,” he said. “All they care about is money and releasing the natural resources for development and destruction for profit, for the corporations and the wealthy of the United States.”
“If we sterilize the environment so that these animals can’t live anymore and we destroy their habitat and we put a few facsimiles of them in zoos,” he said, “that is not maintaining the natural ecosystems that are part of the heritage of the American West.”
A perfect storm brews
Administration actions come at a perilous time for wildlife and natural systems, Servheen said.
Climate change is altering bears’ food and distribution, Servheen said, ticking off threats that need to be monitored. “We have accelerating private land development in grizzly bear habitat, with all the risks that that development brings.
“We have increased recreation pressure in grizzly bear habitat … and that displaces bears, and increases stress, mortality risk,” he said. “We have the elimination of the science team that allowed us to recover the grizzly bear, so we won’t be monitoring them, and we won’t know what’s going on with them if this is allowed to continue.”
DOGE cuts to the federal workforce are contributing to the risk, he said. “We have decreased agency staff — they’re being fired, thousands of them from the Forest Service, BLM, etc.,” he said. “We have the government destroying the very agencies that can manage things like recreation and impacts on wildlife.”
The push extends beyond Western forests, fields and mountains to bedrock environmental protections, he said.
“The key issue here is the destruction of the major laws that got us sound environments and careful management of animals like grizzly bears,” Servheen said. As an example, he said the administration wants to redefine or eliminate “harm” from environmental laws — a term used to protect critical habitat, the destruction of which would hamstring, but not immediately kill, a protected animal.
“And so you have fewer protections for bears and bear habitat and everything else,” Servheen said. “It’s all happening right now, and this is not a good thing for the future of our environment, our public health, and certainly for animals like grizzly bears, which are extremely vulnerable to what we do.
“Once we lose the resources that we have, the natural resources on our landscape, whether it’s grizzly bears or clean air or clean water, it’s going to be almost impossible to bring those things back … to give that magic to our grandkids.”

Faith communities are good at charity, but often fail to explore the root causes of the problems they see. But addressing social ills requires a deeper examination, writes guest columnist Rev. Dee Lundberg.
The post Traveling upstream: A call to Wyoming’s faith leaders to pursue justice appeared first on WyoFile .","Ronald Rolheiser tells the story in his 1999 book, “The Holy Longing,” of the residents of a town by a river who were consistently pulling drowning people out of the water. They did not know where the drowning people came from, but always cared for them, until one day it dawned on them to go upriver and see why they were drowning.

Opinion

Faith communities are often like this. We are very good with charity but fail to go upstream and confront why people are drowning. The needs are overwhelming, yet we are afraid to stir the waters lest we appear “political.” However, if we want to stop the suffering, we must engage in the social justice work needed to stop the drowning. For it was Jesus himself who unabashedly confronted those very systems of oppression. Are we afraid to follow him all the way? In the end, have we helped or have we enabled or even encouraged more bodies to be thrown into the river? Is it our goal to just help these poor drowning people, so we can feel good about ourselves, or are we ready to stop the drowning?
Justice isn’t political, it’s the gospel. It can be seen as divisive, but it is what we are called to do and be as people of faith. You know the line from Mica: “God has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does God require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?” This is not an either/or. As people of faith, we are called to care for those in need, but we must also work for the kind of justice that will free them from their suffering so that the drowning will cease. 
This year’s legislation in Cheyenne was woefully short of any justice, nor kindness for that matter. For instance, having successfully passed through two Senate committees, Sen. Cheri Steinmetz’s Senate File 124, “Illegal immigration-identify, report, detain and deport,” was designed to root out immigrants living in Wyoming who had entered the country illegally. However, it was also plagued with language essentially permitting racial profiling. It had no regard for the children who might come home from school and find no parents and sought to criminalize Wyomingites who knowingly associate with undocumented immigrants. The bill also made it a felony punishable with prison time and hefty fines to knowingly transport or shelter a person who came into the country illegally.
House Bill 72, “Protecting privacy in public spaces act, and Senate File 62, “Sex-designated facilities and public schools,” while seeking to protect Women’s privacy, opened the transgender community to not only their right to privacy, but their safety. Laws like these seek only to stigmatize, degrade and oppress.
Justice shouldn’t be a partisan issue, yet law after law was put through with no regard for the countless lives they would harm. We, as people of faith, have been called time and again to seek justice, yet too many sit on the sidelines, shaking our heads while saying, “isn’t it awful?” Well, the session is over, but the work is not.
We have sat by too long watching while, tragically, many a “Christian” has hijacked the faith in favor of hate, intolerance and downright heartless cruelty. Does your God say “judge” (I’m pretty sure we were explicitly told not to judge) or reach out? Is it not our call to show love to the scorned, the ridiculed and the outcast?
You may have reservations about populations such as the transgender community. I do not, but even if I did, that’s not my call. My call is to care for them like any other neighbor. Your call is to treat them like any other neighbor. You may have reservations when it comes to immigration. Fine, continue your discernment, please. But they, too, are our neighbors.
Being Christian is not a spectator sport. We must risk going against the rapids to get to the source of the problem. You don’t have to support a party or person. That would be political. But we are all called to be on the side of justice.

(Courtesy of the University of Nebraska at Kearney)LINCOLN — While serving as chief of staff to the president of the University of California, Long Beach, Neal Schnoor recalls a request from a student who was unable to attend his graduation because his mother was at home in hospice care.
Schnoor was the “inbox” for the president, he recalled this week, and working with school officials, he said an associate dean and associate provost took robes and met the student at home. 
It was an impromptu, personalized graduation to the student’s needs.
“If a campus with 34,000 students can meet the needs of an individual student and family, we can do that at UNK [the University of Nebraska at Kearney],” Schnoor told reporters Wednesday. “That’s doing the ordinary thing extraordinarily, and we will do that.”
‘I pinched myself’
Schnoor was named UNK’s priority candidate for the next chancellor on Tuesday. The “priority” candidacy is the procedural 30 days where he will visit UNK and meet with faculty, staff, students and the community before he has the chance of being confirmed as leader of the regional campus. 
Under state law, only a single priority candidate is named as part of the search process.

A Nebraska native born in Norfolk and raised in Pierce, Schnoor is currently the president of Northern State University in South Dakota, where he’s served since 2021. Schnoor earlier served two years in his California State University, Long Beach role and, between 2010 and 2012, he was the dean of the School of Education and Counseling at Wayne State College, where he earned a fine arts degree in education in 1990.
Schnoor was a long-time UNK faculty member and administrator, serving as senior adviser to the chancellor for executive affairs between 2012 and 2019 and as an associate professor between 1997 and 2010, where he was director of bands and coordinator of K-12/secondary education.
If confirmed, Schnoor would succeed former UNK Chancellor Doug Kristensen, who retired in May 2024 after 22 years in the top role.
Interim Chancellor Charlie Bicak took over after the retirement of Kristensen, who NU officials celebrated as having never stepped on the brakes during the transitional period.
Schnoor said he has received hundreds of texts from former students, who he said don’t know yet what kind of chancellor he will be. His first steps will be “listening.”
“I pinched myself,” Schnoor said when he learned he was the finalist, saying it was “coming home to an institution that has meant so much to our family and every other person.”
Schnoor’s roots in Nebraska
Schnoor’s roots are in Nebraska, going on to direct high school bands in Lincoln, Kearney and Wakefield after his college graduation.

In the late 1990s, he earned a master’s degree in music education/instrumental conducting and a doctorate of philosophy in education administration, both from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. As a graduate assistant, he assisted instrumental methods and literature courses and also conducted wind ensemble, concert band and the Cornhusker Marching Band.
Schnoor and his wife, Teresa, raised their two children in Kearney and nearby Minden. All of them have taken classes at UNK.
Teresa Schnoor will also retire this spring after 18 years as principal of Kearney’s Central Elementary School. Neal Schnoor said the two have “shared a life and passion for education” and that the first family of UNK would recruit future educators to the “very rewarding career.”
“If she does it like she rounds up elementary kids, we’re going to have quite a few more,” Schnoor said of his wife.
Talking to reporters, Schnoor said that when he recently toured UNK, he saw a campus poised to expand for rural health and wellness, arts and culture, athletics, civic engagement and economic development for the region and state. 
As a first-generation college graduate, Schnoor is also dedicated to ensuring affordable and quality education and uplifting robust, impactful and experiential support.
“We have hard work ahead,” Schnoor said.
Embracing NU’s mission and trajectory
Schnoor has also embraced the mission and strategic plan led by NU President Jeffrey Gold: an “Odyssey to the Extraordinary.”
That will require innovation, “doing ordinary things extraordinarily well” and greater collaboration to maximize the impact of resources, Schnoor said.

Schnoor said he has experience working with state officials, pointing to his first day at Northern State when he got a call from a top leader in the South Dakota Senate about replacing a vintage World War I dormitory to meet the needs of students in business, finance and nursing.
By forging relationships “one at a time,” and giving a tour to the former CEO and executive director of the South Dakota Board of Regents, Brian Maher, the margin passed by wide margins. Since 2023, Maher has been Nebraska’s commissioner of education.
Schnoor said a regional campus needs to fill the needs of its surrounding area, such as work at Northern State to help train more nurses.
At the Aberdeen-based campus, Northern State is in one of the top three shortage areas for registered nurses nationwide, Schnoor said. With continued work, South Dakota officials begin training the next generation of nurses, similar to continued efforts at UNK to expand rural health under Kristensen’s leadership.
Engaging the next generation of Nebraskans will include collaboration with Maher once again, Schnoor said, and engagement with schools, superintendents and students directly.
Schnoor said those efforts need to start as young as kindergarten and get students ready, “or there’s literally no water to feed the plant.”
“We have to be successful, and we’re going to make it a high priority,” Schnoor said.
‘Proud to have him back’
In introducing Schnoor, Dr. Gold said that his love for higher education and understanding of UNK’s power and connection to other campuses, such as for future quality of life or Nebraska’s economic prosperity, “rang true.”

Regent Paul Kenney of Amherst, chair of the NU Board of Regents, said UNK annually contributes $446 million in economic impact and nearly 4,000 jobs. He said he’s thrilled with Schnoor’s strong ties to Kearney and UNK and that he has a “track record of success.”
“We’re fortunate to have a candidate who is so familiar with what makes UNK truly a special place,” said Kenney, whose district includes Kearney.
State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney, who was mayor of the city for 18 years before joining the Legislature this year, said he was very excited to welcome Schnoor and his family back to the community. He said he met Schnoor in the late 1990s and said he and his family have always been a “tremendous asset” to the community.
“We know that he will do an excellent job and we’re just proud to have him back,” Clouse told the Nebraska Examiner.
‘This is the right person’

Gold said NU isn’t just looking for somebody who is “accomplished on paper” but someone who is “equally charismatic” and wants to create deeper and broader connections with elected officials, the community, students, faculty and staff.
“This is the right time, this is the right person,” Gold said Wednesday. “I know that Dr. Schnoor and his family will be incredible assets to this odyssey and will guide Kearney into the next phase.”
UNK Student Regent Sam Schroeder, who will be the student body president of the campus for a second year, was one of three students on the search committee that found Schnoor. Schroeder said he stood out as an exemplary, student-centered leader who asked students what they were passionate about.
Gold, calling back to Schnoor’s comments that he might not know what kind of chancellor he’ll be, said he does:
“I know you’re going to make us all very proud.”

Thompson Federal Courthouse in Nashville on April 24, 2025. (Photo: J. Holly McCall/Tennessee Lookout)A former Tennessee House member testified Thursday she wouldn’t have used a secretive vendor called Phoenix Solutions for constituent mailers in 2019 if she’d known a fired House staffer was running the company.
Patsy Hazlewood, the former House finance committee chair who was defeated in her re-election bid last year, said on the stand in U.S. District Court that former Rep. Robin Smith misled her about the identity of Phoenix Solutions’ operators.
The prosecution termed the case an “epic fall from power” for the state’s former House speaker and his chief aide, while the defense accused the federal government of inventing a case that’s “wasting” the jury’s time.
Hazlewood, one of numerous former and current House members expected to testify in the corruption trial for former Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff Cade Cothren, said she didn’t find out Phoenix Solutions was involved until she saw an invoice. Until then, Hazlewood said she thought Smith was handling the constituent mailers because she had run Hazlewood’s campaigns until winning election to the House.

Smith has pleaded guilty in the federal fraud and kickbacks case and is cooperating with prosecutors. She and Casada were accused of taking bribes and kickbacks to steer business to Cothren after he was fired from his post because of a sex and racist texting scandal that involved Casada, too.
Hazlewood said the scandal that surrounded Cothren “destroyed” his reputation and that she was upset by the incident.
“I had no faith or trust in his integrity,” she said, and added she wouldn’t have worked with him “in any fashion.”
Prosecutors say Casada and Smith had to cover up Cothren’s identity because of the scandal and the “embarrassment” Hazlewood said it caused.
When she inquired about Phoenix Solutions, Hazlewood said Smith told her she knew Matthew Phoenix, a bogus name for the company’s president, and that the company had operated out of East Tennessee but moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico for the “lifestyle” but still could do the mailer work.
“She vouched for his work,” Hazlewood said under questioning from Assistant U.S. Attorney Taylor Phillips.
The prosecutor introduced documents showing Phoenix Solutions formed in November 2019 in New Mexico and had an account with First Horizon Bank with Cothren as the authorized signer.
Attorneys for the defendants acknowledged that Casada and Smith concealed Cothren’s identity because of problems surrounding his departure from the legislature.
In fact, defense attorney Joy Longnecker told the 14-member jury during opening statements that the case isn’t based on whether Cothren is a “sinner” but whether he committed a federal crime. In addition to sexist and racist text messages, Cothren at the time admitted to using drugs while in state offices.
Longnecker told jurors the prosecution created a case “out of junk mail” based on Cothren’s personal indiscretions that didn’t cause the state to lose a dollar or lawmakers to be shorted on constituent mailers, informational pieces paid for with tax dollars.
She termed the case a matter of “politics and business as usual on the Hill.”










In my mind, it was a very corrupted way to do business.


– Rep. Jay Reedy, R-Erin


Reps. Esther Helton Haynes, of East Ridge, and Jay Reedy of Erin were called to testify after Hazlewood concluded her testimony.
Reedy, who used Phoenix Solutions for design and printing of a legislative survey that was distributed in a local newspaper, said he believed he was working with Casada and did not hear of Phoenix Solutions until FBI agents contacted him in May 2021 after federal agents had initiated an investigation into the bogus company.
In response to questioning from Phillips about his reaction to learning about Phoenix Solutions and its operations, Reedy said “In my mind, it was a very corrupted way to do business.”
Defense attorneys cast the situation as Casada, who started Right Way Consulting, and Smith, who ran Rivers Edge Alliance, being paid by Phoenix Solutions for their work rather than receiving kickbacks or bribes for steering work to his company. They admitted that Cothren ran Phoenix Solutions but did all the work requested, which totaled about $52,000.
Casada’s attorney, Ed Yarbrough, told the jury that Cameron Sexton was elected House Speaker in October 2019, after Casada stepped down, and started talking to the FBI before Phoenix Solutions and Right Way Consulting existed.
Former House Speaker Glen Casada and aide indicted on bribery, kickback charges

FBI agents showed up at Casada’s door in August 2021 with TV crews behind them, shooting video of the former speaker in his bathrobe, proof the media was tipped off, Yarbrough said. Yet Casada talked to the agents without an attorney, because he felt his business dealings with Cothren were legitimate, Yarbrough said. He added that Casada made only $4,000 to $7,000 on the arrangement.
Yarbrough further framed the situation of one in which House Speaker Cameron Sexton tried to get rid of Casada and then Cothren for political reasons. Cothren has claimed he helped Sexton win the speaker’s race and sought to obtain phone records to show he and Sexton communicated frequently in the fall of 2019.
Phillips characterized the case as one of “powerful politicians who used their influence to line their pockets” by hiring Cothren and his “pass-through” company to tap into the tax-funded constituent mailers for kickbacks.
The assistant U.S. attorney told jurors that Cothren used a fake identification to run the company and that he signed a federal tax document with the bogus name, “Matthew Phoenix.” Prosecutors did not introduce the document as evidence Thursday.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)The president of the United States is destroying the National Endowment for the Humanities, a tiny federal agency that has existed since the presidency of Lyndon Johnson. 
The defunding of state humanities councils, including in Idaho, is a pathetically short-sighted move. Even worse it’s part of a comprehensive effort by the administration to further “dumb down” a nation where Donald Trump condescendingly celebrates “the poorly educated.”  
Trump administration’s latest federal cuts hit humanities funding in Idaho

Who cares, you might ask, if Elon Musk trashes a little federal agency that people who love history and anthropology value? And what are humanities anyway? 
The National Endowment for the Humanities was created along with the National Endowment for the Arts in 1965 by an act of Congress. The legislation said, in part: 
“An advanced civilization must not limit its efforts to science and technology alone but must give full value and support to the other great branches of scholarly and cultural activity in order to achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future.” 
The legislation passed with strong bipartisan congressional support because there was broad agreement with the kind of thinking embodied in the act. 
“Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens. It must therefore foster and support a form of education, and access to the arts and the humanities, designed to make people of all backgrounds and wherever located masters of their technology and not its unthinking servants.”
Those members of Congress were really “woke” back in 1965. 
 How state humanities councils funding contributes to communities

Full disclosure: I served on the Idaho Humanities Council years ago, chaired the board for many years and also chaired the Federation of State Humanities Councils, the organization that represents the NEH’s state affiliates in Washington. In that capacity I testified – my only time doing so – before a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee chaired by Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson. In those days Simpson was a big supporter of NEH (and the Arts), but that was pre-Trump. I can’t guess whether Simpson will oppose the administration’s budget chainsaw.
My brief remarks back then supported the tiny NEH budget, and I tried to provide a sense of how the Idaho council – and other state councils – use their federal funding. 
For decades, for example, Idaho has sponsored an annual institute for teachers who are provided a modest stipend to do a week-long deep dive into a big subject. The institutes offer mid-career opportunities for teachers to spend time, typically on a college campus, with other teachers learning more about subjects as diverse as Abraham Lincoln’s presidency and the origin and importance of American roots music. The institutes feature fine scholars with deep understand of the subject on offer and the teachers leave the experience with new ideas about how to teach history, literature, religion, art history, law and philosophy. 
State councils often sponsor traveling exhibits developed by the Smithsonian. Idaho has always tried to get those exhibits to rural communities in cooperation with local libraries or historical societies. 
Councils, including Idaho’s, make small grants to scholars to help defray the cost of research often leading to an advance degree. Teacher can apply for a modest “incentive” grant to develop a class on a particular subject. The Idaho council organizes a speaker’s bureau that matches speakers with local audiences, a service club, library of senior citizens center, for example. Former Idaho Lt. Gov. David Leroy is listed as a current speaker. 
A memorable part of my time on the Idaho council were the annual lectures devoted to the humanities. The lectures began in Boise in 1997 when the celebrated historian of the Lewis and Clark Expedition Stephen Ambrose spoke about his book “Undaunted Courage.” The great David McCullough came to Idaho to talk about the importance of founding father John Adams. Novelist John Updike read some of his work before a packed house and insisted on visiting the old Idaho penitentiary during his Boise visit. 
It’s worth noting that the law creating the endowments specify that the governor of each state with a humanities council appoints 25% of the board, which has meant for the last 30 years Republican governors have appointed pretty conservative folks to the board, many who have been involved in GOP politics. Typically board members are educators, community volunteers, business people and folks like me who love history and literature and enjoy the opportunity make meaningful humanities-based opportunities available to everyone. 
 Civility, respect for different views is at the heart of humanities education

My experience at the national level provided an opportunity to visit several state councils. The NEH has long required state councils to conduct reviews of their programs and have those programs evaluated by outside observers. I’ll never forget a trip to Jackson, Mississippi, for a site visit to the Mississippi council, where a superb state director, Barbara Carpenter, showed off programs ranging from the history of southern cooking to the state’s fraught racial history. Civility and respect for different views are always at the heart of these efforts. 
And the NEH’s inspector general has always been something of a legend given the agency’s scrutiny of state council spending. This is not the place to search for waste, fraud and abuse. It just doesn’t exist. 
So, why has the Trump administration stopped all NEH grant funding to councils in Idaho and every other state? State councils are creating close to home educational and enrichment options for millions of Americans who have, for more than 50 years, enjoyed access to such a rich and broad menu of humanities programs. So why kneecap this very American institution dedicated to learning and civility? 
I admit to being baffled by the action. The most recent NEH budget was $207 million, less than the cost of three F-18 fighter jets. By contrast, the Washington Post recently calculated that Elon Musk’s various business entities have, over the last 20 years, pulled in $38 billion in federal funding. So go our priorities. 
I’m left to conclude the obvious – the administration is waging a war on intelligence and learning. How else to explain attacks on libraries, colleges, research, the Department of Education, and state humanities councils? No great nation has ever celebrated poor education or a lack of learning. We now do just that.

Brian Kelsey might not have as much pull as he thinks with the Tennessee Legislature.
Not only did lawmakers decline to take up an amendment he wanted this session to pay for his federal legal defense with state campaign funds, the legislature on the final day amended a bill he wanted to change – if that makes sense – to prevent him from tapping his account for the criminal case.
House Speaker Cameron Sexton was not a fan of Kelsey’s last-minute wrangling.
“The provision was included based on guidance from our legal counsel; however, I firmly believe that campaign funds should not be used to cover legal expenses or matters related to criminal proceedings,” Sexton said in a statement to the Lookout.
The former Germantown Republican started calling lawmakers during the final weeks of the session to ask for help amending a campaign finance bill, apparently because he has a pile of legal bills. Kelsey was released from a federal prison after serving only two weeks of a 21-month sentence when President Donald Trump pardoned him for breaking campaign finance laws. Kelsey directed a scheme to funnel money from his state account through political action committees to the American Conservative Union in 2016 when it bought ads supporting his failed congressional campaign.
Former Tennessee senator extends effort to avoid prison sentence 

The Tennessee Registry of Election Finance told him twice during the legal process he couldn’t use money from his state account to pay attorneys in the federal criminal case. But he persisted and asked for help from Republican Sen. Richard Briggs of Knoxville and Republican Rep. Tim Hicks of Washington County, neither of whom wanted to change their bill to aid Kelsey. Republican Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County offered help with an amendment, but that didn’t go anywhere.
Neither did part of the bill that would have taken money from lobbyists’ professional privilege tax to hire auditors and pay for a new campaign finance reporting system for the Registry of Election Finance and Ethics Commission. Instead, when Briggs’ and Hicks’ bills went to a conference committee to reach a compromise on differing sections, House members added language allowing campaign funds to be used to defend against civil litigation involving an election but not for public relations, consulting and legal expenses involving a criminal matter. Provisions increasing campaign donation limits also remained in the measure that passed.
It’s a tough pill to swallow.
Kelsey, who pleaded guilty to guiding the campaign finance scheme before reneging and withdrawing his plea, hired at least six attorneys for his case. His Red State Political Action Committee has more than $180,300, according to the latest state filing, after he transferred the money out of his state account in 2023.
Considering the truncated prison sentence, his strategy proved successful. He should be thankful. But the “Germantown stunt baby,” nicknamed years ago for using bacon as a prop to complain about pork spending, is never happy until he gets his way.
This time, he couldn’t pull any strings. 
It ain’t over
The Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators announced Wednesday they’ll be embarking on a statewide summer listening tour to talk about “discriminatory” bills that passed the this year.
Caucus Chairman Jesse Chism, a Memphis Democrat, said Wednesday, “we want to make sure Tennesseans across the state are informed on what’s happening up here and get their feedback on issues they face on a daily basis.”
The group is pointing toward moves to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion programs in state and local governments and shift the Tennessee Human Rights Commission to the Attorney General’s Office, which seems more concerned about undoing Biden policies and propping up Trump.
The legislature did give $4.5 million more to the AG’s Office for 10 attorneys. We can assume, then, they’ll be clearing a backlog of Human Rights Commission cases, since critics say the commission hasn’t been doing its job. (Yes, and I’ll be starting for the Boston Celtics the rest of the NBA playoffs. Playoffs?)

DEI programs have been under attack for years, but lawmakers weren’t emboldened to eliminate them until President Trump called for their abolition.
While Republican lawmakers said this week DEI programs are “racist” in nature and others called “equity” a form of socialism, it’s important to remember they came into being to make America look more like America, not a KKK convention.
Black lawmakers such as Democratic Reps. Joe Towns of Memphis and Yusuf Hakeem of Chattanooga blasted the notion that people are getting jobs just because of darker skin color and not their abilities. 
Oddly enough, lawmakers passed a resolution this week renaming the entrance to the Motlow Tunnel into the State Capitol the Heritage Gateway Entrance in honor of those who built it, mainly slaves. If the builders had been looking to the future back in the mid-1800s, they would’ve left out a couple of cornerstones so the massive building would collapse on today’s dunderheads (as long as I have time to get out).
Punishing Memphis
Lawmakers failed to push a Memphis schools “takeover” to passage this session, but they still found a way to punish the Bluff City indirectly, setting up a process to go after $75 million in state sales tax revenue.
The legislature passed a measure allowing the state to withhold revenue from local governments that adopt ordinances in conflict with state law. The statewide bill clearly targets Memphis, which got into a tiff last year with the House and Senate speakers over referendums to enact three sets of gun restrictions, even though they were only “triggers” in case of a change in state law.
Still, lawmakers couldn’t contain themselves and put a bullseye on Memphis.

The bill would allow a lawmaker to request an investigation by Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti to determine whether the locale is breaking state law.
But wait, we thought Skrmetti would be pouring resources into the Human Rights Commission. 
Maybe not if he’s busy digging into Memphis and other local governments (Metro Nashville?) who dare to thumb their noses at the legislature. 
Not that we’re down on the AG’s Office, but his $61 million budget for next year is twice as much as it was six years ago while the workload is down considerably, from 8,138 cases to 4,361, with 30 new employees in that time frame and 190 attorneys on staff, according to the state’s fact book. 
He’s taking on more responsibilities, yet he’s also accused of making the AG’s Office more partisan than ever while turning out fewer legal opinions.
What does that have to do with Memphis? Trust.
Big who?
Tennessee’s Republican supermajority was on the verge of expanding government exponentially this year until key bills were upended because of pressure, money and constitutional problems.
During a February special session, lawmakers approved Gov. Bill Lee’s private-school voucher bill, creating a new school district and spending $140 million-plus annually to help kids leave public education.
It looked like they were on a roll.
But the Memphis schools “takeover” bill, which would have put the state in charge of a management board with authority to supersede the elected board’s decisions, couldn’t gain enough traction this year. It will percolate over the summer.
Memphis schools “takeover” bill dead until next year

Likewise, the bill that required school districts to check students’ immigration status and charge tuition dropped off in the final days because of the $1.1 billion “risk” to the state budget and a constant throng of opposition from preachers, businesses and educators. It was unconstitutional and a violation of anti-discrimination laws, but soon it will return. 
Of course, those are ripe for the picking with a compassionate crew on the high court.
But consider this. When our schools become immigration enforcement bureaus (Oh, by the way, the legislature spent $5.4 million creating such an agency during the special session), we’re really reaching. Or overreaching, as some say.
The same will be said in 2026, because the removals have just begun.
High school NIL?
Decades ago, NIL stood for the Nashville Interscholastic League, made up of the high school teams playing in and around Davidson County. God, those were the days.
Today, it means “name, image and likeness” in collegiate athletics, morphing from the idea that players should be paid for those assets into an all-out arms race to buy the best players in the country.
With that backdrop, critics of a bill allowing student-athletes to transfer one time without moving or sitting out the season are calling the measure “high school NIL.”
Led by Republican Rep. Scott Cepicky of Culleoka, lawmakers were set to adopt the bill this week but let it slide at the last minute after the TSSAA changed its transfer rule to allow a one-time transfer without penalty. Some supporters said athletes should be able to transfer the same as musicians who want to be in a strong band program – as if that’s been a point of contention for decades.

Under the new TSSAA rule, transfers can be made for academic, social-emotional, environmental or mental health needs, as long as the school being vacated confirms the move is not for athletic or disciplinary reasons. (Is that a joke?)
In other words, if a student-athlete dislikes a coach, and just can’t take the running or the shouting any longer, he or she can leave without moving into the new school’s zone. Senators said as much before passing the bill this week.
In the House, the outcome was different when Cepicky said he’d been misled by the TSSAA for months before its board of directors finally adopted the new transfer rule.
The critical thing Cepicky said, though, was that he started working on the bill to help students with “school choice.”
Those who pay attention understand that private schools have been swiping great athletes for years, offering scholarships to win games. That’s what led to the mid-1990s lawsuit over private-school transfers and, ultimately, creation of Division II for private schools.
Granted, anyone who’s ever played a sport or had kids who played sports understands that some coaches should quit. 
But for anyone who’s ever coached, the same can be said about parents, who are typically horrible, and maybe even some of the players, who have become so entitled it’s easier to send them packing than to deal with their attitude. 
This bill isn’t about that. It’s about sending students to private schools with $7,000 yearly in state voucher money, which is why people are calling it “high school NIL.”

“I’ve found myself doing a lot of town halls,” O’Malley said, speaking on his phone from the passenger seat of a car as he hurried to a local TV station.
On Wednesday, he was in Kansas City, Missouri, talking to constituents of Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. Before that he traveled to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, at the invitation of a grassroots group to speak to a big crowd of people worried about threatened cuts to benefits for seniors.
In Racine on Thursday night he joined a town hall hosted by the progressive coalition group Opportunity Wisconsin. U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, a Republican who represents the 1st District, was invited, but did not attend.
“Having served in the agency so recently, as its last confirmed commissioner, I just feel a responsibility to speak up,” O’Malley said of his detour from private life to travel the country criticizing President Donald Trump and Elon Musk for cutting Social Security staff and closing offices.
“The only thing that’s going to stop the driving of Social Security into system collapse is the American people rising up,” he added.
When he came into the Social Security Administration in 2023, O’Malley said, a decade of staff reductions had reduced the agency’s workforce to a 50-year low, just as the Baby Boom generation was causing a spike in the number of retirees it was serving. As a result, “every line of service was headed in the wrong direction.”
“The agency needed to turn things around, and to their credit they did it,” he said. O’Malley is full of praise for the federal workers he supervised, who reduced call wait times from 42 and a half minutes on average to 12.8 minutes, along with other improvements. “It’s one of the most highly skilled executive services I’ve ever worked with,” he said, including when he served as mayor of Baltimore and governor of Maryland. The “obsessive compulsive” culture of the agency, as O’Malley affectionately terms it, has meant that over the last 90 years, no one missed a check.
Then came Trump and Musk, who “unleashed a reign of terror on those employees” — “the same people who got us through COVID without ever missing a payment.”
Mass firings, a hostile work environment, and the huge waste of taxpayer money as employees were paid to walk out the door appalled O’Malley.
Instead of rooting out “waste fraud and abuse,” Musk’s DOGE cut the IT department in half, undoing the work O’Malley and his colleagues had done to improve service at the agency. 
As Trump and Musk drive out the people who know how the system works, intermittent IT outages have become a problem. The website for Social Security accounts has gone down. Wait times are skyrocketing. And as the problems get worse, O’Malley said, “ultimately, it will interrupt benefits.”
“I don’t know when it will happen,” he said, “but when it breaks, it will break.”
What is the point of this wanton destruction? 
“I don’t know what the end game is,” O’Malley said.  
Members of Congress in both political parties have told him they think Trump and Musk have set their sights on the $2.6 trillion in the Social Security trust fund in order to make tax cuts for the superwealthy permanent.
Then there’s Musk’s nihilistic ideology, captured in his assertion that “the fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy.” 
“There’s no more empathetic program than Social Security,” says O’Malley. “It guarantees widows and orphans and people who are disabled don’t live in poverty. Maybe Musk thinks those are useless members of society who don’t help build his immense wealth. I don’t know.”
Whatever their motives, O’Malley is certain that Musk and Trump must be stopped from a campaign that will end in enormous damage to Americans. 
O’Malley’s message is the opposite of Musk’s — far from being riddled with waste, fraud and abuse, the Social Security administration is a model. Fraud affects less than one-half of 1% of Social Security funds. And far from being wasteful, the program spends 1.2% of its budget on overhead, meaning it could be seen as the most efficient insurance company in the world. Private health insurance companies have notoriously high administrative costs.
Other “Big Lies” O’Malley is out to bust include the whopper that immigrants without legal status are draining resources from the system. In fact, they pay about $26 billion in Social Security tax withholdings to fund benefits they themselves can never access, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Nor are dead people drawing Social Security benefits. “There is no zombie apocalypse,” says O’Malley. Facts and figures supporting the efficiency of Social Security are laid out in plain language on his website, winbackourcoutnry.com.
The good news is that people are beginning to push back on the idea that Social Security is riddled with abuse and should be made more “efficient.” 
“Congress people are getting a heck of a lot more calls now than they did two months ago,” O’Malley said, “whether it’s from people experiencing long wait times, or having trouble accessing the benefits they’ve worked their whole lives to earn, or who are just seeing what’s happening on the news.”
That pressure is absolutely necessary if we are going to prevent the raiding and destruction of a New Deal program that has served so many people so well for generations.

Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area is chair of the Legislature's Revenue Committee, which is targeting business incentives and proposing other program cuts to help address the state's projected budget deficit. July 29, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A revised bill aimed at plugging Nebraska’s budget gap by about $51 million, largely by clawing back several business incentives, sparked intense exchanges and nearly three hours of debate Thursday before it advanced another lawmaking step.
Legislative Bill 650 is one way the Legislature’s Revenue Committee proposes to help address the state’s projected biennial budget shortfall, said committee chair State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, who introduced the bill.
He told lawmakers that the committee used a “last-in-first-out” approach in targeting initiatives previously approved by the Legislature and Gov. Jim Pillen. He said the package scales back or repeals incentives and programs the committee believed would have the least negative impact on a typical taxpayer.
“We opted to target business incentives and steer around consumer items as much as possible,” von Gillern said. “In other words, these rollbacks are unlikely to hit the pocketbooks of most everyday Nebraskans.”
 ‘Chilling signal’ 

State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse challenged that assertion, however, in successfully seeking an amendment to save a newly passed law that eliminated a tax on providers that lease space on cell phone towers.
  State Sen. Robert Hallstrom of Syracuse. Dec. 12, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Hallstrom argued that such a tax, which under LB 650 would have equated to about $4 million for the state over two years, likely would be passed on as a cost to cell phone users.
“It will send a chilling signal to providers considering where to invest next, and it will undercut our shared goal across party lines of expanding broadband access to every corner of Nebraska,” said Hallstrom. His amendment passed on a 30-10 vote.
Two other successful amendments by von Gillern on Thursday in effect added more anticipated savings by further paring back an employer relocation incentive program and a rural development program, putting the latest total impact of LB 650 at about $51 million, he said. 
That’s down from the $71 million von Gillern attached to the package earlier this month. He said that earlier projection was partly based on faulty timelines, as certain rollbacks can’t begin in the middle of a fiscal year.
The $51 million is also down from the $140 million worth of clawbacks and program revisions that Pillen sought in his original budget proposal, von Gillern noted. He said the package reflects a “good compromise” made as the committee sought to respond to stakeholder groups yet address a budget shortfall.
As of Thursday, the state’s projected deficit over two years stands at $457 million, as the Legislature’s Appropriation Committee works to whittle that to zero.
 Repealed, scaled back 

Among programs scaled back or repealed by LB 650, and related  estimated savings over two fiscal years, according to the Department of Revenue and an update by von Gillern:

A credit to retailers for collecting sales tax ($11.7 million).
Renewable Chemical Production Tax Credit Act ($8.5 million) 
Relocation Incentive Act ($8 million)
Nebraska Advantage Rural Development Act ($7.3 million)
Nebraska Biodiesel Tax Credit Act ($1 million)
Creating High Impact Economic Futures, or the CHIEF Act ($900,000)
Cast and Crew Nebraska Act ($500,000)
Income tax credit for food donations ($500,000)
Nebraska Shoreline Rail Modernization Act ($500,000)
Reverse Osmosis System Tax Credit Act ($250,000)
Urban Redevelopment Act ($101,000)

Also included is a rollback of a buyer-based exemption ($12.9 million), which was  championed two years ago by von Gillern. It allowed an organization’s tax-exempt status to be used in certain circumstances by a purchasing agent for that group. 
LB 650 passed to its final round of debate with a 34-5 vote.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, who was among the five “no” votes, reiterated criticism that the state is in a position of having to “beg, borrow and steal” because of a “self-created” budget deficit fueled by the Pillen administration-led “inequitable, unsustainable tax cuts for the largest corporations and the wealthiest individuals.”
 ‘Impoverished for eternity?’ 

But the most scorching moments of the debate came after State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County called State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha to the microphone. He noted McKinney’s repeated request to save millions of state dollars by canceling the planned construction of a new prison.

Andersen suggested that some of the budget deficit could be resolved instead by redirecting the millions of dollars appropriated for a North Omaha area business park.
McKinney told Andersen that it seemed as though he had “a problem that North and South Omaha received dollars.”
Andersen responded: “Those are your words. … My perspective is, there’s money that was allocated for COVID relief that is being used for economic development, and that’s misappropriation of funds. That money should be brought back.”
  State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha. July 21, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Andersen left the chamber as McKinney continued and requested that Andersen return to hear him out. He did not immediately return.
“Do you want to see communities like North and South Omaha impoverished for eternity? That’s what it sounds like to me,” McKinney said. “And you probably would be happy to see little Black kids poor for the rest of their lives; little Latino kids poor for the rest of their lives … making sure businesses that are owned by Black and Latino business owners are not as successful.”
Andersen did not respond to a reporter who asked if he had further comment.
Conrad, responding to the exchange during debate, said that federal COVID-19 relief funds were intended to address communities hit hardest during the pandemic. She said communities with high poverty and communities of color were hit “particularly hard” and that there was legislative intent to ensure those federal dollars had a direct connection to those communities.

Arguing that political spending has allowed companies like DTE Energy, Consumers Energy and Blue Cross Blue Shield to escape accountability through political influence, State Reps. Donovan McKinney (D-Detroit) James DeSana (R-Carleton), Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor) and Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City) said people deserve to have their voices heard.
“It doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat, it doesn’t matter if you’re a Republican, doesn’t matter where you live in our state in this country, doesn’t matter how you worship or who you love. People want corporate influence out of politics, and so this is a opportunity to bridge that gap, bring everybody together,” McKinney said. 
According to a survey from Emma White Research LLC., commissioned by the Taking Back Our Power coalition, 81% of Michiganders support limiting corporations seeking government contracts and regulated monopolies like Michigan’s major energy providers from making political contributions.
  State Rep. James DeSana (R-Carleton) speaks at the Taking Back Our Power coalition press conference on April 23, 2025 | Submitted photo
During the previous legislative cycle, at least 119 of the 148 members of the Michigan Legislature accepted political spending from energy utilities including Consumers Energy and DTE Energy, according to an Oct. 27, 2023 report from the Energy and Policy Institute, an energy industry watchdog. 
Wegela criticized Consumers and DTE alongside health insurance company Blue Cross Blue Shield for their campaign contributions, accusing the companies of bypassing contribution limits by donating through “dark money” spending where the donor is not disclosed. 
Among those donations was a $100,000 contribution from an account led by DTE Energy executives to an account linked to former Michigan Speaker of the House Joe Tate (D-Detroit) in 2023, the Detroit News reported. 
“Michiganders are paying the highest rates for energy in the region when we deal with the worst reliability and instead of investing in the grid, corporations are making record corporate profits and spending thousands on campaign donations and lobbying efforts,” Wegela said. 
DeSana noted his support for free market policies before stating the perils of massive corporate and special industry spending in politics are “readily apparent.” 
“I believe that only citizens should fund our elections, and my support for this package of bills is an outgrowth of that belief,” he said. 
Clean Water Action is one of the member groups of the Taking Back Our Power Coalition. Mid-Michigan Campaign Organizer Nichole Keway Biber said corporate funding for campaigns is buying more than influence.
“They’re buying outcomes,” she said. 
“When corporations fund campaigns, we are stuck with policies that leave out the rights and needs of working families,” Keway Biber said. 
Michigan’s energy companies have faced strong scrutiny in recent years as customers face frequent and often lengthy outages while energy rates continue to climb. According to the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, the state ranked as the 9th worst in the nation for reliability, as residents pay the 15th highest energy bills in the U.S.
Under the newly reintroduced bills, utility companies and their affiliates in  the state would be barred from providing political contributions to politicians and engaging in campaign activities. Government contractors with $250,000 or more in aggregated contracts would also be prohibited from making political contributions for 18 months before seeking or entering the contract, during the contract’s term, and 18 months after the contract is terminated. 
While the previous bill package failed to secure a committee hearing, DeSana told reporters at the announcement that there is an openness to these ideas within the Republican-led House of Representatives, noting that they were able to secure the Republican Conference room for the announcement. 
“I’ve had conversations with colleagues who are, they can get 99% of the way there, and I think we’re just going to keep working on that other 1%,” DeSana said. 
Wegela further noted that several of the package’s supporters were in conversation with members of the Democratic-led Michigan Senate looking to have them introduce similar if not identical legislation in the upper chamber. 
Katie Carey, Consumers Energy’s director of media relations, said the company is committed to compliance and transparency, including through its participation in the legislative and political process. 
“Contributions to elected officials can come from one of two places — either shareholder profits, or voluntary contributions made by our employees to the Employees for Better Government (EBG) PAC — and never customer bills,” Carey wrote in an email.
Participation in the employee PAC and all contributions are publicly disclosed on the Secretary of State’s website, Carey said. Additionally, the corporation does not contribute to federal Super PACs, nor does it directly contribute or make independent expenditures to advocate for the election or defeat of a federal, state or local candidate, per the company’s policy. 
Jill Wilmot, director of corporate communications for DTE similarly emphasized the company’s compliance with laws governing corporate donations and political contributions. 
“In compliance with our [Integrated Resource Plan] settlement, we have voluntarily expanded our disclosures to increase transparency for all stakeholders. These disclosures showcase DTE’s commitment to our customers and communities we serve, helping us meet our aspiration of being best in the world and best for the world. The political contributions the company makes are supported by the DTE voluntary employee PAC or DTE shareholders — not from customer revenue,” Wilmot said.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)At least nine international students in Colorado have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration alleging due process violations when their legal status was revoked without an opportunity to defend themselves in immigration court.
The University of Colorado said in a statement that as of April 17 it is aware of 22 students who have had their visas revoked. A spokesperson for Colorado State University said Thursday that 16 of its students have been affected by revocations.
It is unclear how many of the students still remain in the country. 
President Donald Trump issued an executive order targeting student visas of those who participated in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses and another instructing the State Department to review visa programs to ensure no foreign nationals pose a threat to national security. Estimates say over 1,800 international students across the United States have had their visas revoked, though that number could be higher.

Raquel Lane-Arellano, a spokesperson for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, said the Trump administration’s decision to “target students for speaking up” is “really disturbing.” While many of the students in Colorado who have sued say they have not been politically engaged, some who have had their visas revoked have been.
“To see this administration so brazenly target them based on their use of their First Amendment right is a really scary step in the wrong direction,” Lane-Arellano said. 
She said the visa revocations align with how she described the Trump administration’s broader goal of “silencing those who are speaking out against the human rights atrocities that they’re committing, whether that’s abroad or here at home.”
Universities in Colorado need to “stand by their students” and do everything in their power to protect international students being targeted, and support them in efforts to reinstate their visas, Lane-Arellano said. She said universities need to show that their values around “information access and free speech” are more important to them than any funding being threatened by the Trump administration.
Trump has used the threat of withheld federal funds to coerce universities to bend to his policy preferences.
Speaking their minds
Ella Smith, a third-year student at CSU Fort Collins who organizes with Students for Justice in Palestine, said they know at least one CSU student lost their visa for attending protests in support of Palestinian people. They said while police are present at the protests their organization holds, no students have had any formal interactions with law enforcement.  
Smith said they are “appalled” and “disgusted” to see tuition-paying students who are in the country legally attacked for speaking their minds. International students and immigrant students are terrified and exhausted, they said. They said at least six of the CSU students who have had their visas revoked have already left the country. 
“The international community has been seeing lots and lots of … attacks on not only their character, but on their rights, and as people who are here in America, they deserve the same protections as any American citizen, including protections under the First Amendment for speech and for protest,” Smith said. 
Smith said it appears the university has been “scrambling” in recent weeks since visa revocations started in determining how to best help affected students. Student organizations like SJP are trying to get whatever information they can to help other international students, Smith said, but everyone is relying on limited information. 
“What we think is that the university thought that they would see this in different places across the country before they saw it in Colorado — for example, seeing it in New York, in California at the Ivy League schools before it approached Colorado,” Smith said. 
From the Middle East and Southeast Asia
All nine students who filed lawsuits in Colorado are referred to as “Student Doe” in their cases filed in the U.S. District Court of Colorado “due to fear of retaliation by Defendants for asserting their rights through this lawsuit, and of harassment or blacklisting by third parties.” 
The students’ records were deleted from the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, a government database that tracks international students’ compliance with their F-1 visas, which are granted to nonimmigrant international students. The complaints say terminating a record within the database “effectively ends F-1 student status” and that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement does not have the authority to end that status even if a visa is revoked, which the complaints allege the agency did. 
Zachary New, an Aurora attorney representing the nine students, said a visa is a document the State Department oversees, and it determines whether someone is permitted entry into the country. Once they are in the country, the Department of Homeland Security oversees their immigration status. New said there is not a method to challenge the revocation of a visa, which is a travel document, in court, but the plaintiffs are instead challenging the termination of their legal status. 
The students New is working with are from countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, which he said is consistent with students being targeted across the country. The Colorado cases are being litigated individually, and the students all remain within the U.S. 
Newsline reviewed three lawsuits that were filed last week, but access to others that were filed more recently was blocked by the court. 
Defendants in the suits include the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Todd Lyons.










I can't think of anything more disempowering to a young student learning about the world than to be put in removal proceedings or taken out of their ability to be here because they engaged in one of the most sacred constitutional rights we have, which is the right to speak out about things.


– Raquel Lane-Arellano, a spokesperson for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition


ICE said in a statement that it does not comment on pending litigation. In a statement, a senior DHS official said ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations “conducts regular reviews” of the SEVIS database “to ensure visa holders remain in compliance with program requirements.” The official shared a link detailing why SEVIS terminations may occur.
The lawsuits say the reason for the students’ removal from the SEVIS record is “Other – Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked.”
DHS said it will notify the State Department if a violation is identified, as the department has the authority to determine visa revocation “and may consider criminal arrests and other national security concerns.” The statement said individuals who remain in the U.S. without legal status “may be subject to arrest and removal” and that “the safest and most efficient option is self-deportation.” DHS declined to comment on the specifics of the Colorado students’ cases “due to privacy concerns and visa confidentiality.” 
‘The Constitution still matters’
New said he has “never seen something this blatantly illegal happen before” in his time in immigration law. He said he worked on many lawsuits during Trump’s first term, but he’s never seen something “so black and white” before. 
“It suggests to me that the goal of this action wasn’t necessarily to follow the law as it’s written, it was to get this end result to have this psychological impact on students even where there is not really a leg to stand on in a federal court if a student wants to challenge it,” New said. 
Universities and students have found out about their visa revocations by proactively checking the SEVIS database. None of the schools involved received any warning or explanation regarding the plaintiff students’ SEVIS records being terminated. 
The lawsuits allege violation of the Administrative Procedures Act, the Fifth Amendment and the Declaratory Judgement Act when ICE — which operates under DHS — terminated the students’ SEVIS records. They ask the court to declare DHS’s actions unlawful, vacate DHS’s termination of the students’ SEVIS records and order that the department reinstate SEVIS records and F-1 student visa status. They also ask the court to order the defendants to pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys fees.   
A Colorado Springs student’s complaint says they “have not engaged in any significant political activity.” The only criminal history the student has is for possession of alcohol and marijuana as a minor. The student received a new visa approved by the State Department and the DHS after that charge. 
A Denver student’s complaint says their criminal history includes a low fine paid for running a red light resulting in a crash, and a petty larceny offense charge that was dropped. 
A Fort Collins student’s complaint also says they have not engaged in significant political activity. Their criminal history includes a driving under the influence and drunk driving charge in California, which was ultimately dismissed. The student pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count and completed a court-ordered three-month DUI program while serving 12 months of summary probation. 
New said the other students have similarly low-level infractions, none of which include convictions for violent crimes. One student was arrested but never had charges filed against them, he said.   
When he first started working in immigration law, New said he was told it was “the trenches of the Constitution,” as immigration is where the boundaries of the Constitution “are really pushed.” These students have not had the opportunity to be heard in regards to action the government is taking against them, he said.
“In the end, the Constitution still matters. Due process still matters. Procedure still matters,” New said. “In some ways, protecting individuals who are most vulnerable to these Constitutional violations is protecting everybody from having their Constitutional rights eroded.” 
The cases are all in early phases since lawsuits were filed in the last week, and New said more actions should be expected in those cases in the coming weeks. 
Lane-Arellano said the Trump administration’s actions targeting international students will make prospective students wishing to study in the U.S. second guess whether that is the right choice for them. 
“I can’t think of anything more disempowering to a young student learning about the world than to be put in removal proceedings or taken out of their ability to be here because they engaged in one of the most sacred constitutional rights we have, which is the right to speak out about things,” Lane-Arellano said.

(Nathan Howard/Getty Images)As climate change drastically increases the frequency and severity of wildfires, power companies say they’re facing growing risk for payouts that could bankrupt them or require massive rate hikes on customers.
Across the West, electrical utilities are pushing state lawmakers to grant them legal immunity or limit damage payouts if their equipment sparks a blaze.
They’re backing bills, which have passed or been proposed in at least eight states over the past few years, that would require the utilities to follow plans to limit their risks of causing a fire, such as trimming trees or burying power lines. In exchange for taking those steps, lawmakers would give utilities protection from lawsuits that could expose them to billions of dollars in damage claims.
“We’re only one wildfire away from bankruptcy,” said Shawn Taylor, executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association, a group that represents electrical cooperatives. “Even if we avoid bankruptcy, we’d have huge rate increases to cover the cost of a lawsuit.”
Already, utilities are facing soaring insurance premiums because of the magnitude of claims they would face if they caused a fire. Taylor and other industry leaders argue that power companies should be granted relief if they take actions to limit their risk.
In 2019, Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California declared bankruptcy over its roughly $30 billion liability from a series of wildfires caused by its equipment, including the devastating Camp Fire. And in Oregon, PacifiCorp is facing billions of dollars in damage claims due to its role in the state’s 2020 Labor Day fires. PacifiCorp has been a key player backing liability bills in five states, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported.
The proposals face strong opposition from wildfire victims, insurance companies and trial lawyers. Those groups say the bills don’t do enough to protect residents from dangerous electrical infrastructure. And insurers say their own customers could pay the price if lawmakers protect utilities.
“When you push in one side of the balloon, it comes out somewhere else,” said Greg Van Horssen, a representative for State Farm Insurance, delivering testimony before the Montana House Judiciary Committee in February. “If we have a problem with recovering costs for burnt-down houses in Montana, from an insurance company’s perspective, we only have one option, and that’s to raise the rate of homeowners’ insurance.”
Utah became the first state to limit utilities’ liability when it passed a law in 2020. The law protects companies from negligence charges if they have a wildfire mitigation plan in place, and it puts limits on the damages victims can collect, using a fair market value figure that can fall well short of the full cost to rebuild.
This year, Idaho and Wyoming have enacted similar measures, and lawmakers in Montana and North Dakota have sent proposals to their governors. North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong signed the measure, Senate Bill 2399, on Thursday. A bill in Arizona has cleared the House, and an Oregon measure is still in committee. Alaska has also considered liability legislation in recent years.
Utah state Rep. Carl Albrecht, a Republican who sponsored that state’s liability law, said it has compelled power companies to trim trees, bury lines and take other steps to ensure they are complying with their safety plan. He said utilities are frequent targets of litigation.
“People look at the utility as deep pockets that can pay out a lot of damages,” he said. “It’s whoever has the best attorneys and can sell their case in court.”
Michele Beck, director of the Utah Office of Consumer Services, serves as an advocate for Utah energy customers. She said it’s difficult to protect electrical customers and wildfire victims at the same time.
“The costs for ratepayers are substantial, and it’s reasonable to try and find a balance between these extremely high jury awards,” she said. “I admit, it’s a devastating loss for people who are impacted [by wildfires], but somebody is also paying on the other side.”
In Oregon, consumer advocates are similarly torn.
“It is a difficult place to be, having utilities close to bankruptcy and unable to make investments that are necessary to provide service,” said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a nonprofit representing ratepayers. “At the same time, the principle that customers shouldn’t be bailing out utilities for bad practices is a critical standard.”
PacifiCorp says it faces more than $45 billion in liabilities, much of that driven by the 2020 Labor Day fires in Oregon. Multiple juries have found the company liable for failing to cut power to its lines. The massive costs PacifiCorp is facing have limited the company’s ability to invest in its infrastructure and clean energy, Jenks said. PacifiCorp did not grant a Stateline interview request, but the company has been involved in shaping legislation across several Western states.
Oregon state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat, said her bill would not give utilities legal immunity. It would establish a certification process to ensure utilities are mitigating wildfire risk.
“The utilities need somebody else to help them identify the risk they’re carrying,” she said. “We never meant that if you got a safety certification in April that you’re bulletproof over the next year for any sort of wildfire liability.”
But some legal experts told the Oregon Capital Chronicle that utilities would likely use their compliance with the certification process in a legal defense against wildfire claims.
In Arizona, a liability measure has passed the House and advanced in a Senate committee. The bill would protect companies from lawsuits if they follow mitigation plans. Utility leaders say it’s necessary to ensure they can continue providing service.
“Unlike other businesses that might stop doing business in an area where risk has grown too high, we have an obligation to serve customers,” said Joe Barrios, senior media relations specialist with Tucson Electric Power. “Wildfire liability costs and higher insurance costs are passed along to customers through the rates that they pay. [This bill] helps to maintain service affordability.”
But state Rep. Alex Kolodin, a Republican, believes the proposal violates a state constitutional provision that bars the state from limiting residents’ right to sue. And he said that limiting utilities’ liability will reduce their incentive to take safety measures.
“I wouldn’t want to be the legislator who voted for this, and then the utility causes a fire that burns down 200 houses in my district,” he said. “Then I have to explain to my constituents why they can’t recover any damages. ‘Sorry, guys, it’s because your legislator is an idiot.’”
Brandon Vick, a regional vice president with the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies trade group, said utility groups have made a coordinated push across several Western states this session. He noted that more and more residents in fire-prone areas are going without insurance coverage, leaving them with no recourse if they can’t seek damages from a utility.
“Utilities are rightfully concerned that they’re gonna do something that causes a catastrophic wildfire,” he said. “The question we’ve been posing is, who should be responsible when that ultimately happens? [These bills] are really pushing that liability onto the people who can least afford it.”
Several states are also considering a wildfire fund similar to the one California enacted in 2019. Such measures allow utilities to set aside money, funded by a mix of rate increases and shareholder contributions, which they can later tap into to help cover damages caused by wildfires.
Marsh, the Oregon lawmaker, said her proposal would allow wildfire victims to quickly access funding to rebuild their lives. Residents would still have the option to forgo payouts from the fund and sue utilities for full damages. The bill died in committee amid opposition from wildfire victims who characterized it as a bailout for utilities.

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Abortion Support Network plans to show people on Saturday what seeking an abortion was like before the state’s ban took effect nearly three years ago, the group announced in a press release.
The “immersive” event will take place at a former Little Rock abortion clinic that now houses the Your Options Understood (YOU) Center, which AASN launched in the fall of 2022. The center provides resources about abortion, parenting or adoption. 
Little Rock Family Planning Services was the only abortion provider in Arkansas before the state enacted one of the nation’s most restrictive abortion bans, with a narrow exception to save the life of a pregnant person in an emergency.
AASN has helped fund out-of-state abortion services since Arkansas’ 2019 “trigger” abortion ban took effect upon the U.S. Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade in June 2022.
Arkansas lawmakers have since proposed restricting abortion further or clarifying the terms of the existing ban. Some of those proposals became law after the 2025 legislative session, which ended last week, and the 2023 session, which saw a wider range of maternal and reproductive health legislation.
Stockton said she and other activists take issue with legislation that further governs abortion resources when the procedure is already banned. An unsuccessful bill this year would have required health care facilities to be licensed as ambulatory surgery centers in order to perform abortions if the procedure becomes legal again.
“We do not have access to abortion, but [lawmakers] are still doing everything they can to chip away and make it harder,” she said.
Arkansas Legislature saw wide range of maternal and reproductive health legislation in 2023

Even while Roe v. Wade was still in place, state law required Arkansans seeking abortions to jump through “additional hoops,” which will be included in Saturday’s reenactment, said Brittaney Stockton, AASN’s policy and growth strategist. Such “hoops” included a pregnant patient’s written consent for an abortion, a 72-hour waiting period between a doctor’s consultation and the procedure, and the requirement for doctors to show ultrasound images to pregnant patients seeking abortions.
Participants in Saturday’s event will learn why patients of the former clinic sought abortions. No personal information will be shared, Stockton said.
A key aspect of the event will be the portrayal of anti-abortion protesters outside the clinic, which can be “traumatic” for abortion seekers, Stockton said.
“We really want folks to understand what it was like to come into a clinic,” she said. “Whether you were there for a fetal anomaly or because you experienced sexual assault, or whatever … you still had to go through protesters telling you that you were evil, and making a terrible decision, and ‘Why can’t you just think about the baby?’”
The reenactment should last between 10 and 15 minutes, but wait times at abortion clinics used to last hours, Stockton said.
Afterward, attendees will have the opportunity to watch the film Preconceived, a documentary “contrasting the abortion experience with the misleading tactics of crisis pregnancy centers,” according to AASN’s news release. The event is scheduled from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.
The YOU Center is next to Arkansas Pregnancy Resource Center’s Little Rock location. APRC is one of several anti-abortion centers state lawmakers have supported with taxpayer funds since the abortion ban took effect. Thirty-five organizations applied for shares of the $2 million set aside last year; pro-choice advocates have said these centers mislead pregnant people about their options.

Pregnancy resource centers tout their services to Arkansas lawmakers

 

Stockton participated in last year’s attempt to put a proposed limited right to abortion on the November ballot. Many Arkansans were unaware of the near-total abortion ban, she said, and some of her fellow canvassers were not aware of the former abortion clinic in Little Rock.
Saturday’s event is an effort to close gaps in public knowledge about abortion in Arkansas, Stockton said.
“There’s hope in knowing what happened in the past so you can understand and do better moving forward,” she said.
The Arkansas Abortion Amendment did not make it to the ballot after the Secretary of State disqualified more than 14,000 signatures on a technicality.
Other Arkansas laws ban abortions at 12, 18 and 20 weeks’ gestation. A Democrat-sponsored bill to repeal these bans and restore abortion access in Arkansas was not considered by the Republican-led Legislature this year.
 Legislative background

AASN’s services at the YOU Center include free emergency contraceptives, condoms and pregnancy tests. The organization distributed more than 13,000 doses of emergency contraception in 2024, Stockton said.
She also said Arkansans should not take the availability of contraceptives for granted because in her 15 years as a pro-choice advocate, she has watched lawmakers place more and more restrictions on abortion before and after Roe v. Wade’s reversal.

Earlier this month, a House committee rejected a bill from Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs, that would have required minors to obtain written parental consent in order to receive long-acting reversible contraception, such as an intrauterine device (IUD). The Arkansas chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics opposed the bill.
Lundstrum said Thursday she has not decided if she will reintroduce the bill in a future legislative session. She said she wanted the bill to “open this conversation” that IUDs can have side effects and do not prevent sexually transmitted diseases even though they prevent pregnancy.
“These kids are thinking it’s a get-out-of-jail-free card,” Lundstrum said. “The parents and the doctor and the kids need to have a conversation that this is not a be-all end-all.”
Arkansas’ teenage pregnancy rate is more than twice the national average, with the majority of those pregnancies unplanned, according to data from Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. The organization said last year that greater access to contraception and a more robust sex education landscape would reduce the rates of teen pregnancy and birth.
In February, a Senate committee rejected a proposal to require public school students, starting in fifth grade, be shown a fetal development video created by an anti-abortion organization. Stockton spoke against the bill and advocated for more comprehensive sex education in public schools; state law requires abstinence-based sex education, if it is taught at all.
A separate bill that became law this month will require “human fetal growth and development education” and the viewing of an ultrasound video at grade levels to be determined by the Arkansas Department of Health.

Arkansas legislative committee rejects fetal development bill


Lundstrum said she’s not aware of any upcoming proposals to further change Arkansas’ abortion laws.
She said she was asked to sponsor Act 387 of 2025, which clarifies that doctors can perform abortions to save a pregnant Arkansan’s life within “reasonable medical judgment.” The law will “let doctors in emergency situations be doctors,” Lundstrum said. It passed the Legislature with bipartisan support.
Another new Arkansas reproductive health law — Act 859, the Reproductive Empowerment and Support Through Optimal Restoration (RESTORE) Act — requires all entities that receive federal family planning service grant funds to provide services that help women track and manage their fertility.
“The RESTORE Act is groundbreaking legislation that champions reproductive healthcare for women in Arkansas by prioritizing restorative reproductive medicine,” conservative group Heritage Action for America stated in a news release Wednesday.
The law also prohibits state-funded entities from penalizing a medical professional who declines to participate in fertility treatments due to “sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions.” Another new law allows medical providers to opt out of providing abortions for religious reasons.

(Getty image)Many fantasize about inventing the next “big thing.” But the cost of protecting their ideas from copycats can be a shocking dose of reality.
Rhode Island leaders want to help residents and small business owners achieve their dream inventions by helping pay for costs associated with a federal patent application. Gov Dan McKee and Rhode Island Commerce Corporation are slated to unveil the new Invention Incentive Program Friday morning, one day before World Intellectual Property Day.
“When Rhode Islanders have a good idea, they should have a fair shot at protecting it,” McKee said in a statement. “By covering some of the upfront costs, this program gives Rhode Island inventors and small businesses the opportunity to take an important first step — protecting their ideas and setting the stage for what comes next.” 
Costs to apply for a federal patent vary widely based on the type of patent and type of applicant, but range from $60 to more than $11,000, according to a fee schedule on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website. That does not include the cost to hire attorneys.
Rhode Island businesses with 500 or fewer employees, or individual residents, can apply to Rhode Island Commerce to receive reimbursement for up to $5,000 in application fees for provisional or nonprovisional patents, or costs associated with hiring a federally registered patent practitioner licensed in Rhode Island. 
Grant applications open Friday and will be accepted through 5 p.m. on May 26.
“Innovation drives economic growth, and our small businesses are at the heart of that momentum,” Rhode Island Commerce Secretary Liz Tanner said in a statement. “This initiative is an investment for Rhode Island’s future — helping protect great ideas while empowering entrepreneurs to compete, grow, and lead.” 
The grants are funded through a $1 million lump sum for “Innovation Initiatives” included in the state’s fiscal 2025 budget, $45,000 of which is set aside for patent grants, Matt Touchette, a Commerce spokesperson, said in an interview.

This image depicts particle sizes compared to fine beach sand and human hair. (American Lung Association)After news that Louisville’s air just received a failing grade for its high rates of particle and ozone pollution, a UofL Health researcher and nurse practitioner says the news is not surprising and steps can be taken to protect people’s health.
Rachel Keith, a nurse practitioner with UofL’s preventive cardiology clinic and a clinician researcher with the Environment Institute, said that while Louisville has “had occasions to kind of bounce up a little bit and get better” it’s been in “that F range for a while.” 
During a press conference Thursday, Keith discussed the “State of the Air” report, which the American Lung Association released Wednesday. 
The report showed that Louisvillians spend more than a week every year breathing unhealthy air. In Louisville, “unhealthy days” for ozone pollution number eight per year on average — an increase from the average of five reported in the 2024 report. Ozone pollution can come from a variety of sources including cars, power plants, industrial boilers, refineries, chemical plants and more, according to the U.S. Environment Protection Agency (EPA).
Here’s more of what Keith had to say about the report. This Q&A has been edited for length and clarity.

Question: Why does Louisville have such poor air quality? 
Answer: Air quality has two main pieces that the American Lung Association looks at. One is gaseous compounds. The one that we tend to do really poorly on is something called ozone, and the other is particulate matter. 
Louisville has really high levels of something called NOx (nitrogen oxides) and we also have some high levels of things called VOCs (volatile organic compounds).Think of these as gasses that readily react in the air when you add sunlight on top of it. They mix into this three-oxygen compound called ozone that’s really bad for health. 
Here in Louisville, we have high sources of those emissions that come from combustion, and particularly the NOx — that can be roadway, that can be industry, that can be different sources of it. We also have this stagnant air that comes with being in the river valley. 
So, we have the stagnation of air, we have high production and we have a weather and air pattern that brings other regions’ air into our area. And all that with our sunlight, especially that we have in summer, leads to really high levels of these compounds and these air pollution factors that can affect health.
Q: What exactly is ozone pollution? 
A: Ozone is a gas. Gas is like air; it’s a light molecule, a light compound. It has three oxygens, and it can be reactive and highly reactive. 
In particular, in Louisville, we have a lot of that really highly reactive ozone, which, as it implies, means that it can interact with lots of things. It can interact with a human and make them unhealthy, but it can also do damage to plants and crops and these other aspects of our environment.
Q: Are there risks for people in their day-to-day lives from this pollution? 
A: I think everyone, when you think of a gas or air, things like this, immediately it goes to the lungs. And there are risks for lung problems. It can trigger asthma, it can lead to asthma. People who have COPD or other breathing conditions — this can contribute to that. 
But I think the lesser known and lesser thought about health conditions are really important too. Long term exposure to these, and even at somewhat low levels — so not like you’re looking outside and see smog — can lead to heart disease, strokes, can affect diabetes. There’s now links of air pollution to autism, Alzheimer’s.
Your whole body is negatively impacted by these compounds. Unfortunately in our city, they’re really high, so it’s going to lead to people having detrimental health problems from the air they breathe. 
Q: Are there any signs and symptoms that people should be on the lookout for? 
A: Those ones that you’ll see are definitely related to respiratory conditions. So they’re asthma, people with COPD. It can be trouble breathing, feeling what we call ‘air hungry,’ — even though you are breathing, you feel like you’re not getting enough — wheezing. 
Most people have very distinct symptoms to their particular condition, and so those are the ones you’re going to see right away. 
What’s harder are those that take 10 to 15 years to really manifest, because you don’t feel your arteries hardening. You don’t realize you’re not getting the blood flow, or the proteins may be changing in your brain. Those are the ones that I think are most scary, because people don’t know they’re happening until it’s too late, and they have a big problem with it.
Q: Is there a way to progress past an F — even to a D or a C? What are things people can start doing to help? 
A: The easy answer is: you have to reduce emissions. That’s the easy answer. That means, if you bring down NOx, if you bring down VOCs, your air quality will change. 
The hard answer is, how? One simple thing I typically think about is: if we say a lot of this comes from combustion and automobiles, Louisville is a big commuter city, and so there are simple choices people can make that could impact our air quality. 
One of them that an individual could do was, if you think of a car pool line or at a drive through restaurant or places like that, whether you choose to idle or turn your car off, makes a huge difference. 
On a policy level, supporting things that can make public transportation easier or more available, things like bike lanes and sidewalks that also could potentially change the dynamic of our transportation in the city are very easy ways to think through a way for us to reduce emissions.
Q: What effect, if any, do disasters have on air pollution? What about the 2024  Givaudan Sense Colour explosion? 
A: All these are going to affect it. 
Wild fires and explosions, industries, controlled burns that sometimes happen — these all impact air quality. In particular, in 2024, we had those emissions blowing down from up north (Canada). That year was absolutely impacted by wildfires. And it also goes to show that those can be in a whole other area, region, country, and our air quality changes with it. 
Q: Does air pollution ever lead to acute problems? 
A: Asthma attacks are a very relevant acute problem, as is an exacerbation of COPD, but it can change your heart rhythms. 
We do think that there’s a potential for those to trigger heart attacks, but the duration you’re exposed and the levels plays into that. It’s not a given, but there are studies that suggest even things like an acute heart attack can occur at these higher pollution levels.




How to reduce personal carbon footprint
The Columbia Climate School offers suggestions for lowering individual carbon footprints. They include:

Avoid buying fast fashion clothes, which result in significant waste, and buy durable clothes or recycled items instead. Think: vintage and thrift stores. 
Use reusable bags when shopping. 
Turn off lights and unplug electronics when they’re not in use.
Find ways to drive less — carpool, bike, walk or use public transportation — when possible. 
Travel by airplane as little as possible. When you travel by air, try to book a nonstop flight to create fewer take-offs and landings.

State education leaders pushed back, asserting that teachers would still be pivotal participants on the committees and extended the period they could apply to participate to May 2.
The concerns surfaced after the agency announced the committees’ application process on April 17, a day before the Virginia Education Association (VEA) office and some schools closed for Good Friday. The original deadline for teachers to apply to participate was April 24, but  the interest the agency received prompted the pushed-back cut off date, according to VDOE Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson.
Historically in Virginia, teachers have been central to adjusting cut scores to determine whether K-12 students meet proficiency levels, by reviewing assessment questions and determining the minimum score needed to be considered passing. Educators must apply to serve on the committees to demonstrate their understanding of grade-level content and assessments. 
However, this year’s process will include educators, instructional specialists, and community stakeholders such as parents and business leaders. Community members will undergo a selection process led by the board and the governor’s office. Committee meetings will begin next month.
The VEA, which was also closed Easter Monday, had said the short application period left them scrambling to notify teachers about the opportunity to serve on the committees. 
“Why would you let teachers know about something like this with only days to do something about it?” asked Carol Bauer, VEA president. “We wouldn’t do that to our students. The paperwork involved in this process can take an hour or more. It begs the question — does VDOE really want teachers’ input on this?”
Bauer said teachers’ presence on the assessment committees is essential because they work with students every day and they know them better than anyone else in Virginia’s school systems. 
“They understand their students’ needs and how to meet them,” Bauer said. “Not having teachers involved in important decisions that affect their students’ futures would be an injustice. It wouldn’t make sense.”
However, state education board President Grace Creasey, an appointee of Gov. Glenn Youngkin and former educator, said teachers will continue to be key contributors on the committees. 
“These committees are generally made up of more teachers than other stakeholders,” Creasey said. “I have personally participated in them during my 12 years in the classroom and understand the importance of ensuring teacher voice in this process. I’m excited for the standard setting committee work to begin.”
Creasey also defended the application process, stating there have been “several rounds” of internal and external reviews with stakeholders, testing provider Pearson and the agency’s Technical Advisory Committee.
Gullickson said in a statement to the Mercury that as of Wednesday, the agency received 231 applicants with 71% of those being educators.

The Virginia Board of Education will take a final vote on the updated performance standards in July, after staff presents the proposals for review in June.
If approved, the overhauled standards will not take effect until spring 2026.
 Raising the benchmarks

Raising academic benchmarks in public education are part of a broader push by Youngkin’s administration to “restore excellence in education,” which includes hiking standards in core subjects, increasing transparency and accountability and overhauling the state’s assessment system.
The administration’s goal is to adjust the cut scores to better align with the rigor of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The administration has often referred to the NAEP data to show the “honesty gap,” or the disparity between state-level proficiency standards and the more stringent NAEP standards.
Between 2017-2022, Virginia’s fourth-grade reading and math results showed a stunning 40-percentage-point gap between the state’s Standards of Learning assessment tests and NAEP assessments. 
The governor has asserted that the state’s current proficiency standards are the result of the previous Board of Education lowering cut scores and altering school accreditation standards. 
However, Anne Holton, a former state education secretary and a current Board of Education member appointed by former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, defended the previous board’s approach. 
Holton, the only board member not appointed by Youngkin, has stated that Virginia’s pass rates aligned with the NAEP’s “basic” achievement level, which reflects, according to NAEP, “partial mastery of the knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at a given grade.” 
Instead, the Youngkin administration wants Virginia to meet NAEP’s “proficient” standard — defined as a student demonstrating a deeper understanding of complex topics and the ability to apply them in real-world situations.
Holton said the process of shifting to the NAEP’s higher standard would bring about a dramatic change for the commonwealth. 
“There are arguably good reasons to do it, but it’s not gonna make any kids smarter,” Holton said. “No kid can jump higher because the hoop got raised.” 
Instead, the state’s focus should remain on what helps kids learn better, Holton said, such as implementing the Virginia Literacy Act, “which has been strong and has helped to make kids smarter, but we needed more of that.”

(Photo courtesy of Hugh Kenny)For the past few years, observers have been warning that the huge surge in demand for electricity to serve data centers will mean higher electricity bills. In its December 2024 report on data centers in Virginia, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) confirmed projections that the increased demand for power and the need for new infrastructure to serve data centers would raise rates for everyone, not just the data centers. 
Right on cue, on March 31 Dominion Energy Virginia filed a request with the State Corporation Commission to increase the rates it charges to all customers. If granted, the increase would amount to an additional $10.50 on the monthly bill of an average resident. In a separate filing on the same day, Dominion asked to increase residents’ bills by another $10.92 per month to pay for higher fuel costs.  
Either out of a monumental failure to read the room, or because Dominion executives feel they might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, the rate filing also asks for an increase in the company’s authorized rate of return, from 9.7% currently to 10.4%.
But it’s not all bad news. Along with the rate increase request, Dominion filed a proposal to create a new rate class for large-load customers like data centers. The move coincides with enactment of new legislation requiring the SCC to examine whether electric utilities should separate data centers into their own rate class to protect other customers, something the SCC was in fact already doing. 
And Dominion is not alone. Virginia’s other major investor-owned utility, Appalachian Power, filed a similar proposal on March 24, following one from Rappahannock Electric Cooperative (REC) on March 12. The proposals reflect a growing consensus that ordinary residents should not be forced to bear the cost of building new infrastructure needed only because of data centers. Moreover, if data centers close up shop before the costs of the new infrastructure are fully paid for, residents should not get stuck paying off these now-stranded assets.  
In Dominion’s case, there is good reason to worry. In the first day of testimony at the SCC regarding the company’s 2024 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), a Dominion witness admitted that of the $7.6 billion worth of planned new transmission infrastructure listed in the IRP, residential customers will pay 55%, including for infrastructure that serves only data centers. 
It’s not immediately clear how much setting up a new rate class for data centers will change that outcome. Dominion proposes creating a new large-load class for customers using at least 25 MW at capacities of 75% or more (meaning that they have a consistently high level of electricity use, as data centers do). These customers would be subject to a number of new requirements, including posting collateral and paying for the substation equipment that supplies them. They would also have to sign 14-year contracts (including an optional 4-year ramp-up period) obligating them to pay for the greater of actual electricity use or 60% of the generation and 85% of the transmission and distribution capacity they sign up for, even if they use less.
Dominion says the proposed generation demand charge is much lower than that for transmission because transmission and distribution assets must be designed for 100% of capacity, while generation is only planned for 85% actual metered load. Based on that, though, you might think the correct demand charges would be set at 100% for transmission and 85% for generation. It’s also not clear whether 14 years is long enough to recover all the costs incurred to build new infrastructure, or whether that’s even the outcome Dominion is striving for. 
There are sure to be a lot more of these kinds of questions when the SCC takes up Dominion’s rate case. The SCC will have to evaluate Dominion’s proposed large-load tariff against a worst-case scenario: an industry-wide disruption that suddenly and dramatically reduces data center demand across the state, leaving a utility with excess generation and transmission capacity that can’t be backfilled and that other customers will be stuck paying for. 
Fortunately, Dominion’s proposal doesn’t have to be considered in isolation, since the SCC will be able to compare it to those from APCo, REC and utilities in other states. According to APCo’s filing, its new rate class would be limited to the largest new customers (those with at least 150 MW in total or 100 MW at a single site). These customers would be required to pay a minimum of 80% of contracted demand even if they use less, which the company says is a significant increase from the demand charge of 60% that applies to existing customers. (You’ll notice it’s also a lot more than the 60% demand charge Dominion is proposing for data centers.) 
APCo’s filing notes that its proposal is consistent with a data center tariff it recently agreed to in settling a case in West Virginia; in both cases, customers would have to sign 12-year contracts, following an optional ramping-up term of up to 4 years, with requirements for posting collateral and stiff exit terms. 
APCo has other experience to go on as well. Its parent company, American Electric Power (AEP), made news when its subsidiary in central Ohio proposed to charge data center customers at least 90% of contracted demand or 90% of their highest demand over the preceding 11 months, whichever is higher, and committing them to contract terms of at least 10 years, after a ramp-up period of up to four years. Data centers pushed back hard on these terms, and the Ohio Public Utilities Commission is considering different settlement proposals with somewhat lower demand charges. 
REC’s filing takes an entirely different approach. REC is the largest of Virginia’s co-ops, serving a territory that stretches from Frederick County in northwest Virginia down through Spotsylvania and as far east as King William County. As data center development pushes outward from Northern Virginia, REC finds itself overwhelmed with new demand. It now expects up to 17 gigawatts of data center demand by 2040, up from near zero in 2023, dwarfing all other customers’ loads.  
Like other utilities, electric cooperatives have an obligation to serve all comers in their territory, so if a new data center moves in, they have to provide the power. But unlike Dominion and other investor-owned utilities, co-ops are customer-owned nonprofits. They are highly motivated to protect their existing customers from the costs – and risks – involved in serving new ones. 
REC is a distribution cooperative only, with no generation of its own. Today, REC gets all its electricity from Old Dominion Electric Cooperative (ODEC), a sort of umbrella organization that owns generating plants and supplements those with power purchased on the PJM wholesale market. But when ODEC learned how much new data center load REC was expecting, it told REC to look elsewhere for the power. 
REC’s solution is to silo off big data centers and other customers with more than 25 megawatts in demand, and keep all the costs and risks involved within that space. According to the proposal the co-op filed with the SCC, data centers that want to get power from REC will have to post collateral, contribute to the cost of new infrastructure and sign two agreements, one for the power supply and one for its delivery. REC (or an affiliate it plans to create for this purpose) will buy electricity from PJM on the open market and pass through the cost. Alternatively, the data centers will be able to buy electricity from competitive service providers, allowing them, for example, to procure renewable energy.  
REC’s proposed delivery contract is similarly designed to ensure the data centers pay all the grid costs the utility will incur in serving them. In addition to contributing to the cost of new infrastructure, data centers will have to sign contracts with terms that must “be structured to recover the full cost of distribution and/or sub-transmission plant investment, maintenance and operation.” This includes payment of a demand charge that isn’t specified but appears to be as high as 100% of peak demand – meaning, there would be no risk that these grid costs would end up on the tab of residents and other customers outside the class.
REC’s approach might be seen as a sort of gold standard for protecting other ratepayers from the costs and risks involved in providing energy to data centers. It’s not a perfect antidote for rate increases, because the tight supply of generating capacity within PJM is already pushing up costs of electricity even for existing customers. And buying electricity on the open market may cost data center customers more than buying it from a utility that owns its own generation, as Dominion and APCo do. But that isn’t a concern that will keep REC’s other customers up at night. 
The very different approaches proposed by REC, on the one hand, and Dominion and APCo, on the other, reflect the difference between a nonprofit distribution cooperative and investor-owned utilities that build and own generation. Building stuff is how investor-owned utilities earn a profit. The bigger their customer base and the more electricity those customers demand, the more the profit. The data center industry looks to them like a big, fat golden goose. 
It isn’t surprising, then, that neither Dominion nor APCo are proposing solutions that put all the risks involved with serving data centers onto the industry, the way REC’s proposal does. As a new Harvard Law School report details, the utility profit motive and the political muscle of Big Tech inevitably lead to a cost shift onto other customers.  
Maybe there is something different about data centers in Virginia that justifies involving ordinary residential customers in this risk. Dominion will surely make that pitch when the SCC takes up the case. 
It will be interesting to observe, but color me skeptical.

Forest Protection Bureau)In 2024, New Hampshire wildfire numbers climbed 24%, burning nearly double the acres compared to 2023, according to the state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources. 
Rapidly changing weather conditions in the fall brought about the bump, said Chief Steven Sherman, head of the state’s Forest Protection Bureau. The flames threatened 37 structures and destroyed four, the department said.
“We had really dry, low relative humidity conditions, and the forest fuels just dried out so quick that we ended up with a lot of acres in the fall,” Sherman said, “which isn’t completely unheard of, but last year was just the way everything changed so quick, I think, is what was surprising to everybody.”
With Gov. Kelly Ayotte declaring this week Wildfire Awareness Week, it’s a reminder of the dangers the fires pose in New England, where wildfire risk is considered relatively low. While the flames can bring destruction, the smoke alone can cause serious health problems, even for residents far from the site of the fire. Granite Staters experienced this up close in 2023 when Canadian wildfire smoke prompted air quality concerns in the state. 
Changes in the climate, driven by human use of fossil fuels, are creating the warmer, drier conditions in which wildfires thrive, scientists say. 
“I think it’s a really fair expectation that one of the most widely experienced impacts of global warming will be reductions in air quality from wildfire,” said Justin S. Mankin, an associate professor in Dartmouth’s Department of Geography.

“There’s been a lot of compelling science that has shown that the particulate matter — so these are little, little aerosols from burned fuels — that can then get mobilized throughout the atmosphere, carried extremely long distances, thousands of kilometers, deposited elsewhere, and affect the air quality of people very far away from from the wildfires,” he said. “… And it poses some, you know, real cardiovascular and pulmonary issues, particularly for people that have pre-existing conditions of some kind, or for the young as well.”
Though 2024 saw higher activity, Sherman said the number of wildfires in the state has remained consistent, with the average sitting at over 200 fires a year and between 220 and 250 acres burned. 
“Really, what we’re seeing happen more often now is that we just have these extreme shifts in weather,” Sherman said. Even with rain in the state so far this spring, he said, “conditions can change just so rapidly, where before we get into green up, we’ll probably have a period here, it looks like we might be entering one, where we’re going to have those lower relative humidities, and conditions will just change very rapidly.”
Sherman attributed the “quicker shifts in extreme weather” to the impacts of climate change. He said those shifts are the biggest change he’s seen since he started doing this work in the late 1990s. He also noted the impact of lower snowpack in the winter.
“It used to be more common that your snowpack would get you out of that drought situation with the slow melt in the spring, and you’d go into a nice, lush spring,” Sherman said. “And this year, you can still look at the drought monitor and see that that drought in the southern part of New Hampshire is still hanging on.”
Mankin said the “ingredients for wildfire” are fairly straightforward: fuel, ignition, and a way for the fire to spread.
“The way climate change is really most saliently impacting wildfire risk is by altering the fuel loadings on the ground and kind of creating the conditions that give the wildfire time to spread, “ Mankin said, “… so often by altering precipitation patterns, because it’s really precipitation that puts out wildfires.”
Mankin emphasized that wildfires are “an essential and natural part of ecosystems,” and an “important sign of ecosystem health.”
New England in general has historically been described as “the asbestos forest, meaning … it took a lot to get it to burn,” said Steven Roberge, a professor of natural resources and the state specialist of forest resources for the University of New Hampshire Extension.

But there are forest types and ecosystems in the region that rely on periodic burning, “historically, either by Indigenous people or just natural events like lightning strikes and things like that,” Roberge said. Prescribed fires — carefully planned, managed fires set for a purpose — are used as management tools today, but “I think most folks who do prescribed fire would probably tell you that they don’t have a chance to do it enough,” Roberge said.
The Northeast is full of fuel for wildfires, and “it likely has a wildfire deficit owing to the way we’ve managed wildlands in the Northeast and our kind of history of fire suppression,” Mankin said. “And at some point, that deficit will likely be recouped by the climate system and by those ecosystems.”
The changing conditions raise questions about the status quo of management practices. 
“I think the risk is increasing, and I think we need to be prepared for that,” Mankin said. “You know, to the extent that we are acclimatized to the status quo, the status quo is no longer right, and to the extent that we are adapted to a wildfire regime that we had, that regime is no longer, and so that requires a real careful interrogation of current practices and how they should be altered to accommodate a rapidly changing climate system.”
To monitor the fires, each town has a forest fire warden appointed by the state, Sherman said. Local fire departments are the first to respond to the fires, with the state there to offer support, he said. And each day, working in conjunction with the National Weather Service, the state puts out an updated fire risk. 
If a wildfire starts in the state, the response is 100% suppression, Sherman said. But about two to three times a year, the state will do a prescribed fire. These fires follow detailed burn plans, and are done under “very strict guidelines,” he said. 
The White Mountain National Forest runs its own program and does significantly more burning than the state. But “in the past few years, we’ve actually hired a prescribed fire coordinator, so we’re building up our capacity more,” Sherman said.
Spring is the start of wildfire season, prompting the awareness week in late April. Research shows that the vast majority of wildfires are caused by humans. 
Residents need to obtain fire permits for any outside burning, such as bonfires, Sherman said. Additionally, they should be aware of weather conditions and avoid burning on hot, windy, dry days, he said. And it’s vital to extinguish fires completely; “that means stirring it up, putting water, stirring it up again, and doing that until it’s out cold,” Sherman said. 
The department also recommends residents clear pine needles and leaves from gutters and roofs, as well as keeping wildfire fuel (such as twigs, branches, firewood, shrubs, or other flammable materials) at least 5 feet away from buildings. 
While wildfire risk in New England is considered relatively low, “these hazards are experienced locally and need to be managed locally,” Mankin said. 
“It’s hard to kind of get wildfire intensities that look anything like the American West, but we are not invulnerable to it,” Mankin said, “and I think this last year and the last several years have actually really been salient examples of that.” 
The most obvious way to mitigate these risks, Mankin said, “is decoupling human well-being from carbon emissions, which means, you know, investing in the energy transition and the decarbonization of our economy away from this ancient, fossilized way of sourcing energy. That will prevent future climate change, which alters the risks of wildfire massively.”

(Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images) ISSAQUAH, Wash. — In the wake of recent natural disasters, state leaders across the country are finding that emergency support from the federal government is no longer a given.
Under President Donald Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied federal assistance for tornadoes in Arkansas, flooding in West Virginia and a windstorm in Washington state. It also has refused North Carolina’s request for extended relief funding in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
While it’s not uncommon for the feds to turn down some requests for disaster declarations, which unlock federal aid, state leaders say the Trump administration’s denials have taken them by surprise. White House officials are signaling a new approach to federal emergency response, even as Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threaten to shut down FEMA altogether.
“The Federal Government focuses its support on truly catastrophic disasters—massive hurricanes, devastating earthquakes, or wide-scale attacks on the homeland,” Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, which advises the president on issues of national security, said in a statement to Stateline.
Hughes said state and local governments “often remain an impediment to their own community’s resilience.” He called on states to take on a more extensive role.
“States must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk, commonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem,” the statement said.
Trump wants states to handle disasters without FEMA. They say they can’t.

State emergency management leaders say the federal retreat from disaster response has upended a long-established system.
“This is very unusual,” said Karina Shagren, communications director with the Washington Military Department, which oversees the state’s emergency management division. “This is the first time in recent memory that we have hit all the indicators to get FEMA’s public assistance program and we’ve been denied.”
Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations, said the president has “broad discretion” to approve or deny disaster requests, regardless of whether they meet specified conditions. If Trump intends to curtail federal support, Coen said, he should give states clear guidelines.
“They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren’t spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied,” Coen said.
He added that states need guidance if they’re expected to build emergency management programs to take on what the feds once handled. Not all states, Coen said, have the capacity to replicate those functions. And disasters are expected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change.
“Having that capability in every single state instead of having one FEMA is not the best use of tax dollars to prepare for the worst day,” he said.
Historically, FEMA has coordinated the federal response during emergency situations. In the National Security Council statement, Hughes said Trump has promptly authorized “life-saving emergency support to states during and in the immediate aftermath of disasters.”
But the agency’s larger role has focused on recovery after disasters, assessing damage and distributing funding to help communities rebuild. Now, some communities are finding that support is no longer a sure thing.










They should have a dialogue with the states, so the states aren't spinning their wheels making requests that are going to get denied.


– Michael Coen, former chief of staff at the Federal Emergency Management Agency


Issaquah, Washington, was among the cities hit hard by the “bomb cyclone” that ripped through the state last November. Severe winds killed two people in the state, knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents and caused millions in damage, state officials said.
A city of about 40,000 residents in the Cascade foothills, Issaquah’s costs from the storm totaled $3.8 million — covering road repairs, removal of 800 tons of tree debris and overtime pay for first responders. Mayor Mary Lou Pauly said the city has seen four events since 2020 that qualified for federal disaster aid, with no previous denials. If Washington is unable to win its appeal with FEMA, she said, Issaquah will take a financial hit to its reserves, leaving it more vulnerable to future storms.
“We put a lot of investment in being resilient,” Pauly said. “When you get to a number like $3.8 million, that is too big of a number for us to be able to rebuild without assistance. Our residents pay federal taxes, and this is what they think they pay them for, this is what they expect their national government to do. They do not want me to set property taxes 100% higher.”
Pauly echoed Coen’s view that FEMA should give states a clear outline of the role it will play.
“What we all want to know is what are the rules of the game?” she said. “If the criteria has changed, then why aren’t we getting told about it?”
Washington state leaders said they were shocked when FEMA denied their request for $34 million to help repair roads, utilities and power systems. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson said the state’s application met all of the “very clear criteria to qualify.” He has vowed to appeal the decision.
“We were really relying on that funding,” said Shagren, of the Washington Military Department. “If the appeal is denied, our local jurisdictions will have to prioritize which projects they can move forward with and which they don’t. They’re going to be impacted greatly. This wasn’t some small storm.”
Get rid of FEMA? Trump-appointed group to look at shifting disaster response to states.

Other states also have been surprised by FEMA denials. Arkansas suffered 14 tornadoes last month, triggering a request for a disaster declaration from Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. But the feds told state leaders to handle it on their own.
“[I]t has been determined that the damage from this event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state, affected local governments, and voluntary agencies,” the federal government’s denial read, according to Arkansas Times.
Sanders has appealed that decision, saying the disaster caused “widespread destruction” that requires federal help.
In West Virginia, state leaders asked for disaster aid to cover 14 counties that were struck by flooding in February. But FEMA denied individual assistance to seven of those counties. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that he is looking at options to appeal, but praised the Trump administration for its “strong support” following the floods.
Democratic leaders in the state have called on Morrisey to demand more help from the feds, WOWK reported.
Meanwhile, FEMA has said it will no longer match 100% of North Carolina’s spending to recover from September’s Hurricane Helene. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the cost share was crucial to the state’s efforts to rebuild.
“The need in western North Carolina remains immense — people need debris removed, homes rebuilt, and roads restored,” Stein said in a statement this month, according to NC Newsline. “I am extremely disappointed and urge the President to reconsider FEMA’s bad decision, even for 90 days.”

(Getty Images)This week, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya sent shockwaves through the autism community by announcing the creation of a “disease registry” to track autistic people.
Nazi Germany used such a list to identify possibly hundreds of autistic children to be killed in experimental “euthanasia” clinics. Until the 1970s, numerous U.S. states used registries to identify disabled people to be subjected to forced sterilization and institutionalization. A number of states still maintain lists of autists.
“The history there is deeply, deeply disturbed,” says Larkin Taylor-Parker, legal director of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. “It doesn’t usually end well for us. It has ended in murder — industrial-scale incarceration and murder.”
In a presentation given to NIH leaders April 21, Bhattacharya said the registry will draw from an unprecedented compilation of public and private databases to be used for U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s controversial new study of autism. In addition to information collected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the registry and research database will include pharmacy records, private insurer claims, lab and genetic testing information, treatment records from the Department of Veterans Affairs and Indian Health Service — even data from smartwatches.

Though the plan described is still too vague for advocates to know for sure, NIH might also tap state records that identify neurodivergent children who receive special education services. In the 2022-23 school year, almost 1 million autistic students attended U.S. schools.
Bhattacharya promised “state of the art” protections to guard patient confidentiality, explaining that 10 to 20 groups of outside researchers would be allowed to use the data but not download it. It is unclear whether this meets any legal standard for privacy safeguards.
As The 74 has reported, the man tapped to lead Kennedy’s study was found to have practiced medicine on autistic children without a license, prescribing a dangerous drug not approved for use in the U.S. and improperly giving them puberty blockers.
Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaxxer, intends the study to find a link between autism and vaccines. More than two dozen studies have discredited the notion of any connection.

With few details released about how the NIH will compile data — some of which is subject to privacy restrictions at various federal agencies— it’s unclear how patient confidentiality will be maintained.
NIH researchers are not bound by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, the main law that restricts who can access private medical information, and under what circumstances. Instead, the institutes must adhere to the Privacy Act of 1974, which protects “records that can be retrieved by personal identifiers such as a name, Social Security number or other identifying number or symbol” and, with limited exceptions, “prohibits disclosure of personally identifiable records without the written consent of the individual(s) to whom the records pertain.”
The privacy law was enacted in large part to stop federal agencies from sharing damning information about people singled out by former President Richard Nixon and former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover as political enemies. Since President Donald Trump’s second inauguration, privacy law experts have expressed alarm that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has gone into sensitive government records systems without legal authority to do so. Some courts have ordered a stop to the practice.
“The thought of a federal registry of autistic people that includes incredibly personal data that makes us very easy to find deprives us of the privacy that other citizens enjoy,” says Taylor-Parker. “It taps some of my community’s deepest fears and the specters of some of the most horrifying episodes in our history.”
In the 1930s and ’40s, German and Austrian public health officials reported the names of “malformed children” to the Third Reich’s Ministry of the Interior for a list of those targeted for sterilization or death. Among those supplying names was early autism researcher and Nazi collaborator Dr. Hans Asperger. He identified nearly 2,700 children, most commonly citing “education problems” as the reason.
Until 2013, Asperger’s Syndrome was a diagnosis given to autistic children who were believed to be “higher functioning” — Asperger himself called the visibly intelligent children he experimented on “little professors.”

Most advocates now recognize efforts to distinguish higher- and lower-functioning autists as false and harmful. In his presentation to NIH staff, however, Bhattacharya said the new research will consider the perceived severity of subjects’ autism.
“I recognize, of course, that autism, there’s a range of manifestations ranging from highly functioning children to children that are quite severely disabled,” he said, according to CBS News. “And of course, the research will account very carefully for that.”

This, too, terrifies Taylor-Parker, who notes that autistic people who are nonverbal or also have a developmental disability have historically been involuntarily placed in asylums and other facilities and are still often excluded from general education classrooms.
“We already have a societywide problem…with ignoring the support needs of people who can hold down a job, can drive a car and maybe score well on an IQ test,” she says. “On the other hand, we ignore the capacities, the capability, the humanity of people who don’t do those things.”
Further, she points out, compiling as much diagnostic and prescription information on autistic individuals as possible is likely to uncover other private information that people fear could end up on future “disease registries.”
“I’m very concerned about this becoming a slippery slope,” says Taylor-Parker. “There is very good research demonstrating that [autistic people] are trans and gender-nonconforming at above-average rates.”
In the interest of establishing the prevalence of autism and in some cases understanding which services are helpful, several states and two national philanthropies already maintain registries. With a goal of ensuring that as many children as possible are offered early intervention services, at least two contain identifying information.
Good intentions notwithstanding, many autistic people oppose the existence of any registry, citing the historical danger they pose for disabled people in general. Indeed, recognizing this last year, New Hampshire lawmakers eliminated the state’s autism registry.
Since Kennedy’s appointment, autistic people have repeatedly decried his plan to again attempt to link autism to vaccines, despite dozens of credible studies that have ruled out immunizations as a cause. His plan, they charge, would divert resources from research into therapies and services that can improve the lives of people with disabilities.
Says Taylor-Parker, “That discussion sucks the oxygen out of the room when it comes to making life better for autistic people who are already here and who will be born in the near future.”
According to the NIH, video of Bhattacharya’s presentation will be posted in the coming days.

A study of state and federal data by the Ohio-based Center for Community Solutions found that more than a quarter of the state’s population receives health coverage through Medicaid.
Medicaid in Ohio covers two in five children, one in five working-age adults and one in 10 adults aged 65 and older, according to the center.
The largest group in the state’s Medicaid caseload is families and children, making up 53.2% of the cases, followed by the 25.5% covered by the Medicaid expansion. Older Ohioans, along with the blind and disabled, make up 16.6% of the caseload.
Since Medicaid was expanded in Ohio, the uninsured rate in the state dropped by half, state data say. The Health Policy Institute of Ohio has stated that the Medicaid expansion “has been a major contributor to Ohio’s uninsured rate dropping by half from 14% in 2010 to 7% in 2022.”
Ending Medicaid expansion would devastate Ohio’s economy

“Preventive care and treating conditions early reduce the need for high-cost emergency room visits, long hospital stays and additional public spending,” the Center for Community Solutions study on Medicaid stated.
Nearly 50% of the 769,520 Ohioans who are on Medicaid expansion are a part of the state’s workforce, and others on the expansion are “students, caretakers, or dealing with a chronic health condition,” the center found.
This is notable as the Trump administration and Congress look at cuts to Medicaid as part of proposals to slash federal spending overall, along with proposals regarding work requirements for the program.
Ohio is looking into its own cost-cutting measures, including a provision built into the House’s version of the budget that would trigger cuts to Medicaid in Ohio should the federal government reduce the contribution it makes to the state’s Medicaid coffers.
The Ohio House and Gov. Mike DeWine’s budget proposals would eliminate Group VIII, the group included in the Medicaid expansion, if the federal government stops funding 90% of the expansion.
Advocates and supporters of Medicaid fear that $880 billion could be cut from Medicaid in the budget reconciliation process underway in D.C. They say that would have devastating consequences for low-income areas and those in most need of help.

According to health policy researchers at KFF, $880 billion in federal cuts over the next decade would represent 29% of per-resident spending on the program, They say the federal cuts “are equivalent to all Medicaid spending on 3 million seniors and people with disabilities, 14 million other adults or 22 million children enrolled in Medicaid.”
Nationally, Medicaid has an enrollment of 72 million, many of whom are in Republican-led states like West Virginia, Arkansas, and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson’s home state of Louisiana. Johnson has claimed the program has billions in yearly waste, fraud and abuse.
Edwin Park, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy, discussed the cuts during a panel discussion hosted by the USC Center for Health Journalism. Medicaid covers 40% of all births in the country, with more than one-third of Medicaid enrollment represented by children, Park said.
Unlike the federal government, states are required to balance their budgets, therefore Medicaid cuts at the federal level would necessitate cuts by the states.
“These cuts are very large, and states would not be able to sustain their current Medicaid programs as is over the long run,” Park said.
To compensate for a loss in federal funding, Park said states could cut Medicaid programs. They could also cut other parts of their budgets, which would most likely be education funding because it’s another of the most expensive programs. Or states could raise taxes dramatically.
From Park’s perspective, states would probably start with cuts to optional Medicaid services, such as vision and dental coverage, and try to obtain waivers for certain parts of Medicaid, such as prescription coverage.
A loss of just the Medicaid expansion group in Ohio would cost 770,000 Ohioans their coverage. It’s a group that is made up of 19 to 64-year-olds who have household incomes less than 138% of the federal poverty line, and who aren’t eligible for other Medicaid coverage. For a family of four, that’s about $44,000.
There are high Medicaid enrollment rates in Southeast Ohio and rural counties, including House Speaker Matt Huffman’s home in Allen County, where Medicaid covers 28% of the population.
The Senate is hashing out its budget ahead of the July 1 deadline. Fifteen percent of Henry County, where Senate President Rob McColley lives, is covered by Medicaid as of March of this year.
Pike County had the highest Medicaid rate in the state last month, with 42% of residents covered by traditional Medicaid, and 10% in the Medicaid expansion group. Neighboring Scioto County had a 41% Medicaid enrollment, and 12% of its population in the expansion. Clark, Adams, Lawrence and Gallia counties all had similarly high rates, above 30% for traditional Medicaid, and between 8% and 11% in the expansion group, according to state data and Center for Community Solutions analysis.

(Courtesy of National Medical Association)Los Angeles pediatrician and urgent care specialist Dr. Ilan Shapiro worries for his chronically ill patients as he watches Congress weigh significant cuts to Medicaid.
He thinks of a boy who, before finding Shapiro’s clinic, was in and out of emergency rooms and intensive care units because of severe asthma attacks, instead of competing in soccer games and studying for exams. The boy’s parents were losing hours and pay at work with the frequent ER visits.
Shapiro, who is Latino, works at a federally qualified health care center, a clinic for low-income patients. Most of his patients are people of color on Medicaid, and roughly a quarter of them are children.
Research shows Latino and Black family physicians are more likely to see Medicaid patients compared with their white and Asian counterparts. Experts say the Medicaid cuts Congress is weighing would strap health care centers that rely on already-low Medicaid reimbursements, disproportionately affecting communities of color and the physicians they rely on.













It's not just health insurance. It's a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.


– Dr. Ilan Shapiro





Of the 72 million people covered by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities, more than half are people of color, with Black and Hispanic people disproportionately represented on the rolls.
Black and Hispanic patients have a higher risk of conditions such as high blood pressure, kidney disease and certain cancers, making health care access crucial.
Congressional Republicans are considering $880 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid spending to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. Conservatives have long argued that Medicaid is too expensive. They assert its expansion under the Affordable Care Act to more working adults has diverted too much money toward nondisabled people, taking resources away from vulnerable populations the program was originally intended to help.
But clinicians and policy analysts say the federal Medicaid cuts could have an especially detrimental impact on vulnerable enrollees, including children, older adults and people with disabilities or chronic illnesses, as states are forced to find savings to fill the gap.
One GOP proposal targeting Medicaid expansion could lead to reductions in children’s health insurance programs, according to a February report by the Urban Institute. The think tank estimates that proposed cuts to federal Medicaid expansion spending could increase the number of uninsured kids by 11.8%.
“I’m deeply afraid,” said Shapiro. “It’s not just health insurance. It’s a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.”
 Bias and language barriers

Just 6% of U.S. physicians are Latino and 5% are Black, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Sustaining the relatively few medical practices with Black and Hispanic providers is important amid evidence that racial bias, lack of access to culturally competent care and language barriers lead to poorer health outcomes or access.
For example, analyses have shown Black patients are less likely to be prescribed pain medication, and some clinicians hold false ideas that Black patients have a higher pain tolerance. Nearly 1 in 3 Black, Hispanic and multiracial women reported mistreatment in medical settings during pregnancy and delivery, such as receiving no help when asking for it or being shouted at, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.
Language barriers, which Latino communities are more likely to face, are also associated with poorer health or limited access to health care.
“We understand the language and cultural concordance and the improved outcomes,” said Dr. Linda Mirdamadi, an adjunct clinical assistant professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine who serves on the National Hispanic Medical Association’s board of directors. “There’s a sense of trust.”
Mirdamadi said federal cuts to Medicaid would lead to loss of preventive care for her large, diverse community.
“If they don’t have access to health care, they’re not going to have the access to chronic disease prevention, to vaccines, to cancer prevention screening,” she said. “It is going to just increase the disparity gaps that already exist.”
 ‘Ripple effect’

Dr. Roger Mitchell, president-elect of the National Medical Association, which represents Black physicians, said a widespread loss of Medicaid coverage would affect everybody, even people with private insurance. People without health coverage often don’t have primary doctors and forgo preventive care, resulting in more trips to the emergency room. That can lead to longer wait times at ERs for everyone, regardless of their health insurance.
Mitchell also pointed out that Medicaid reimbursements are a major funding stream for hospitals and clinics that see a lot of enrollees. Without that money, many of those providers might be forced to scale back their services or close.
“The ripple effect is enormous,” said Mitchell, who heads Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C., where about 40% of patients are covered by Medicaid. “This is an issue that’s not just affecting one portion of the U.S. populace, but all of us, and has the potential to have huge harm.”
Dr. Zita Magloire is a family physician, but she also offers obstetric care along with two OB-GYNs at Cairo Medical Care in the south Georgia city of Cairo. The city is the county seat of Grady County, which has about 26,000 residents, almost 30% of whom are Black.
Her practice is one of the few in the area that takes Medicaid for obstetric care, she noted, and serves many Central American immigrant patients who drive from the surrounding rural areas to her clinic. When another practice in the area started cutting services, her center absorbed those patients.
“There’s not a lot of providers that accept Medicaid,” she said. “What does that look like? Well, they [patients] show up with no prenatal care — and then, you have very high-risk patients.”
Back in Los Angeles, the boy whose family found Shapiro’s clinic is now a teenager. He received stable asthma care there and got Medicaid coverage.
“He started having a medical home. Everything changed. The ER visits and the intensive care unit visits changed to soccer games,” Shapiro said. Having coverage, he continued, “makes a huge impact for the entire community.”

Enough! That’s what a large, growing and bipartisan chorus of legal experts, government watchdogs and average North Carolinians are saying right now in response to Judge Jefferson Griffin’s farfetched effort to overturn his Supreme Court election loss last fall to incumbent Justice Allison Riggs.
It’s been almost six months now since Griffin was narrowly defeated – a fact confirmed by two recounts – but nonetheless, he persists in his brazen effort to have thousands of ballots cast according to the rules in place at the time of the election thrown out. It’s a remarkable stance that, if somehow validated, would invite all kinds of post-election mischief in the future and further undermine faith in our democracy.
Fortunately, an end to this absurd situation could be in sight as earlier this week, a federal appeals court granted Justice Riggs’ request to put a stay on confusing lower court directives.
The bottom line: For the sake of our democracy, let’s hope the court’s action is a signal that it’s ready to take control of and put an end to a dispute that’s gone on way too long.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Less than seven weeks to go before June’s primary elections, former state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli is leading the crowded race to become New Jersey’s next governor on the Republican side, while Democratic voters remain divided on who they’ll pick to represent their party on November’s ballot, according to a new Rutgers-Eagleton Poll.
Five Republicans and six Democrats are angling to replace Gov. Phil Murphy, a term-limited Democrat.
“We currently have a tale of two primaries,” said Ashley Koning, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University. “On the Republican side, a leading candidate is coming into focus, while on the Democratic side, there is no clear frontrunner, given that most of the Democratic candidates are within striking distance of one another.”
Scores of voters still have no idea who the candidates are and a third of voters on each side remain undecided even though the candidates have raised millions to campaign, according to the poll released Friday.

On the GOP side, 42% of registered Republicans and Republican-leaning independents surveyed said they prefer former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, who ran against Murphy in 2021 and came close to winning.
Former radio host Bill Spadea came in second, with 12% of poll respondents choosing him. State Sen. Jon Bramnick was next, with 4%, followed by Justin Barbera, a Burlington County contractor, with 3%. No one polled picked former Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac, while 4% said they liked none of the candidates.
President Donald Trump has not endorsed anyone in the race, but Republican and GOP-leaning voters were split about whether that would matter, with 46% saying it’d make them likelier to support the endorsed candidate, another 46% saying an endorsement wouldn’t impact their vote, and 7% saying they’d be less likely to vote for a Trump-endorsed candidate, according to the poll.
On the Democratic side, voters polled had no clear consensus.

Rep. Mikie Sherrill had the most support, even though only 17% of those polled said they prefer her. Next up was Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, with 12%, followed by Sean Spiller, New Jersey Education Association’s president, at 10%; Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Rep. Josh Gottheimer, each at 9%, and former state Sen. Steve Sweeney, at 7%. Four percent of those polled preferred none of the candidates.
“Though not necessarily unusual at this stage in the game, candidates on both sides of the aisle still lack name recognition from a notable number of voters, and no candidate on either side of the aisle is viewed favorably by more than one in five voters,” Koning said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-25 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont negotiates healthy raises for CT state troopers,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/25/lamont-negotiates-healthy-raises-for-ct-state-troopers/,The raises for CT state troopers could trigger similar raises for the rest of the unionized state workforce.,"Legislators are looking to delay raises for most state workers as Connecticut braces for big cuts in federal aid. But early indications are those pay hikes — whenever they arrive — will be healthy, costing the state more than $120 million per year.
Gov. Ned Lamont and the union representing nearly 900 state police troopers recently struck a tentative deal that grants a 2.5% cost-of-living increase next July 1. All but senior troopers also are eligible for a step increase that adds about 2 more percentage points to the raise.
Those proposed raises for troopers, which legislators will be asked to ratify later this spring, offer indications of the pay hikes to come for the state’s more than 40,000 other unionized employees.
In other words, how would Connecticut convince arbiters it can’t afford 4.5% raises for engineers, social workers, IT professionals, custodians and others — once it had granted such increases to troopers?
The prospect of new raises topping 4% for all workers is already polarizing legislative leaders this week. 
Majority Democrats say the state workforce is badly understaffed and that many agencies struggle to recruit or retain employees. But Republicans ask why the administration, which anticipates Congress will slash hundreds of millions or even billions in aid to Connecticut and its municipalities, is poised to dole out raises that exceed those offered most private-sector workers.
GOP leaders: Democrats exaggerate CT budget crisis
“Clearly they [Democrats] are just playing a shell game,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. “They continue to beat the drum there are phantom cuts coming” from Washington.
In recent days, Democratic-controlled committees have proposed legally exceeding the state spending cap next fiscal year; redirecting $700 million from a savings program to reduce pension debt to instead off-set impending cuts from Washington; and boosting taxes on businesses and high-earning households.
“I think we have to be extremely careful with the [wage] contracts that are presented before us,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield. “Keep in mind the taxpayer.”
“For weeks, lawmakers have claimed that massive federal cuts are looming, using fear as a tool to justify breaking Connecticut’s bipartisan fiscal guardrails,” said Carol Platt Liebau, president of the Yankee Institute, a conservative fiscal policy group. “Yet they’ve made no effort to reduce state spending and instead proposed a budget that blows past our spending cap.” 
Both Harding and Candelora praised the important work done by state troopers but said legislators should be looking to freeze wages for all state employees before adopting the measures proposed in committee.
The Lamont administration estimates the troopers’ raises would cost $6.3 million next fiscal year, a tiny share of an overall state budget expected to approach or exceed $27 billion. But if all workers get similar raises, the overall cost approaches $130 million, based on past estimates from state analysts.
Asking workers to forgo raises one year wouldn’t be too painful, Candelora added, given the healthy increases they’ve received in recent years.
The legislature ratified a four-year contract with the troopers union in 2023 that set compensation for the first three years and stipulated a reopener to set wages for the 2025-26 fiscal year.
The Lamont administration estimated when that original contract was presented that the average salary for troopers would increase by 9.7% in the first year, 3% in the second and 4.8% in the third.
Most state employee unions have received 2.5% general wage hikes and a step increase for each of the past four fiscal years.
Democratic leaders: CT is struggling to maintain its workforce
Democrats say the issue is more complex than that.
The Executive Branch workforce shrank 10% between 2011 and 2018 as then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and the legislature often used attrition and hiring freezes to close budget deficits.
The Lamont administration has struggled to attract and retain workers because Malloy significantly scaled back pension and other retirement benefits for new hires through concessions agreements with unions in 2011 and 2017.
More than 4,400 veteran state employees retired between Jan. 1 and June 30, 2022 — roughly double the total normally seen in a full year — just before certain restrictions on pension benefits tied to the 2017 concessions package took effect.
The state police contract ratified in 2023 was specifically designed to boost compensation to stem a trooper recruitment crisis. 
“The Republicans pay lip service to supporting law enforcement, except where it really counts,” said Senate President Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, predicted some rank-and-file Republican legislators would support the new raises proposed for troopers.
“It will not be their entire caucus voting ‘no,’” the speaker said. “No chance.”
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, said “municipalities regularly give raises above and beyond what state employees get,” further complicating efforts to retain workers.
Osten also noted that state government spending on overtime has increasingly been criticized but reflects inadequate staffing in “24-7” agencies such as the state police force and the Department of Correction. Osten is a retired correction officer supervisor and former president of the correction supervisors union. 
According to the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis, agencies and departments spent more than $158 million on overtime through the first six months of this fiscal year — about $6.7 million, or 4.4%, more than they had through the first half of the prior year.
The State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, which represents all major state employee bargaining units excluding the troopers’ union, wrote in a statement that the state police suffer from “severe understaffing.”
The force stood at roughly 1,100 one decade ago when the troopers union battled Malloy in court because a statute directing a minimum level of 1,248 troopers was not being followed. 
The SEBAC statement added that “recognizing the need to provide fair wages and working conditions is an important step forward towards protecting the vital public services upon which our communities depend.”
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said the administration “appreciates the difficult and essential work done by the men and women of the Connecticut State Police. This wage reopener continues the current wage increase pattern for their bargaining unit.”
The president of the Connecticut State Police Union, Todd Fedigan, could not be reached Thursday for comment.
According to the details of the wage agreement the Lamont administration filed Wednesday with the General Assembly, the state police union ratified the deal on April 14.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201008_PoliceGraduation_DunkinPark_KIM_01.jpg,,,2025-04-25 06:05:09.559903

U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander, a Democrat from Nashua, has represented New Hampshire’s 2nd District in Congress for just over three months. While she acknowledges the hectic nature of becoming a lawmaker during President Donald Trump’s second term, Goodlander made a point to emphasize some basics in an interview with the Bulletin this week: the housing market, health care, and child care prices.
“I think our system is being tested right now in ways that we’ve never seen before,” she said, during a visit Tuesday to Monadnock Community Hospital. “Government’s not functioning at the federal level in the way that it ordinarily functions where, when, as a member of Congress, I ask a question of the Department of Health and Human Services, and we get answers to that question.”
Goodlander harkened back to her work on Trump’s first impeachment trial. Prior to becoming a congresswoman, Goodlander worked in a number of non-elected government roles, including as an adviser to several U.S. senators and in the Biden administration. An attorney, she served as counsel to the House Judiciary Committee in late 2019 when the Democratic-controlled House voted to impeach Trump over a phone call he made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy threatening to withhold military aid unless Zelenskyy announced an investigation of Joe Biden. The Republican-led Senate ultimately voted to acquit Trump in early 2020. Goodlander compared the administration’s recent actions to those that motivated her and her colleagues to impeach Trump during his first term.
“The case that we brought is really, at bottom, what we’re seeing play out every single day with this administration,” she said. “We’re seeing abuses of power of all varieties, including of the variety that was like the direct case that we brought back in 2019.”
She condemned the Trump administration sending hundreds of migrants to a Salvadoran prison without due process, decried Trump’s tariff strategy as a senseless trade war conducted at ordinary Americans’ expense, and called for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has been embroiled in controversy over mishandling classified information, to resign. Goodlander said that if Democrats were in the majority, she would support an impeachment investigation into Trump.
“There has been no inquiry that has started,” she said. “But what I can tell you is that we’ve seen a pattern and a practice over the course of this second Trump administration that repeated itself in the first and so yes, I do believe that there would be credible grounds to really conduct a thorough investigation. But I want to stress that I really believe that there shouldn’t be casual talk about impeachment proceedings. This is a punishment that our Constitution really reserves for a very, very select subset of offenses. We’re talking treason and high crimes.”
Goodlander said it’s a priority of hers to help her party win a majority in the House of Representatives during 2026’s midterm elections.
“The system our Constitution creates is of three co-equal branches,” she said. “And we need a check on this administration.”
Goodlander cited this as one of the reasons she decided against giving up her seat in the House to run for Senate in 2026. When Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who has represented New Hampshire in the Senate since 2008, announced she wouldn’t seek reelection last month, Goodlander openly considered joining the race to replace her. However, she announced last week she would not launch a campaign, instead endorsing U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, who remains the only candidate in that race so far.
“I’m really grateful, and I’m humbled by the outreach that I got from people all across the state who encouraged me to take a look at the Senate seat,” she said. “The job I’m in right now, I’m on Day 109. … I want to dedicate all of my energy towards ensuring that we have a House of Representatives, which is the body that’s closest to the people.”
Throughout communication with constituents, Goodlander said she’s heard consistently about the rising cost of housing, child care, and health care. As such, those are priorities for her, she said.
“Our system is just simply not working for so many hard-working people,” she said. “And we’re in an environment right now where the big fight is about how we’re going to dedicate federal resources and federal programming. And I just can’t think of a more wrong approach than the approach that we see the Republican majority in Congress taking and this administration taking, which is to fund trillions of dollars in tax breaks on the backs of hard-working people, and that’s going to mean higher health care costs. That’s going to mean higher costs across the board.”
She singled out housing among these issues as one she hears about constantly.
“Housing is a cornerstone of the American dream, and it is so far out of reach for far too many people,” she said, pointing to rapidly increasing rent and home sale prices in New Hampshire.
Asked whether she thinks the constant controversies swirling around the White House are a distraction to addressing issues like housing, Goodlander said, “We’ve got to do both at once.”
“We are seeing people — Republicans, independents, Democrats — who are stepping up and speaking out and want to be involved in a way that I don’t think we’ve seen in a long time in this country,” she said. “And this is what gives me a lot of hope: the people who are coming from across the ideological spectrum, some of whom I’m sure voted for President Trump, but did not vote for what they’re seeing happen here right now. They did not vote for the biggest cuts to Medicaid in American history. They did not vote for an indiscriminate, reckless, senseless set of trade wars that are jacking up costs and putting small businesses out of business. This is not what they voted for.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/goodlandertalks-e1745527961692-1024x780.jpg,,,2025-04-25 05:00:27.117092

Unsurprisingly, most of that benefit comes in the form of greater future earnings of kids who attend pre-K and then show up to kindergarten prepared to learn, the analysis said.
“Seven dollars of every $10 of benefits generated by a universal prekindergarten program come from future labor market earnings of children,” Scioto Analysis Principal Rob Moore said in a written statement accompanying the report. “According to the evidence we have, universal prekindergarten could be a strong long-term economic development investment for Ohio.”
The Ohio state government doesn’t fund universal pre-K. Some cities, including Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dayton, and Toledo, have funded pre-K programs that are less than universal. 
Head Start is a federal pre-K program, but in Ohio and most other states, eligibility is generally restricted to families living at or below federal poverty guidelines. For a family of four, that’s less than $42,000 a year.
Ohio near bottom in preschool spending compared to other states

The Scioto Analysis report cited research showing that universal pre-K can benefit kids from middle-income families almost as much as it does those from poor ones.
In Ohio, 57% of three and four-year-olds were enrolled in pre-K in 2022. Using the Washington State Institute for Public Policy’s benefit-cost analysis of universal prekindergarten, the Scioto Analysis report modeled the impact on the economy if 71% of Ohio’s preschoolers went to prekindergarten.
It found that adding 29,000 Ohio kids to the program would benefit the economy by cutting the time kids would later spend repeating grades, in prison, or needing special education. But by far and away, the biggest benefit was in kids’ future earnings.
“This benefit occurs because children develop essential cognitive and social skills during prekindergarten which lead to higher academic achievement and better job prospects,” the report said.
In its draft of the biennial budget, the Republican leadership of the Ohio House has been generous to the state’s wealthiest interests.

The billionaire Haslam family wants $600 million to move the Browns out of downtown Cleveland and into a new stadium in Brook Park. House Finance Committee Chairman Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, built that funding into the budget, calling it “a once-in-a-lifetime project.” He added that new stadiums are “huge economic drivers.”
However, most economists who have studied them would disagree. 
They say stadiums by and large don’t create new spending. Instead, they shift existing discretionary spending from one part of a regional economy to another, experts say 
“The empirical evidence shows repeatedly that stadium subsidies fail to generate new tax revenue and new jobs or attract new businesses,” the Tax Foundation said in an October report. “While attending a sporting event or a concert in a new, publicly subsidized venue might benefit fans of the team or those who attend the event, those subsidies shift spending that would have occurred in other parts of the city or state in the absence of a new sports stadium or arena.”
Meanwhile, by developing intellectual capital, public education provides multifaceted benefits to the economy, experts say.
“Research shows that individuals who graduate and have access to quality education throughout primary and secondary school are more likely to find gainful employment, have stable families, and be active and productive citizens,” Dana Mitra of Pennsylvania State University said in a research report. “They are also less likely to commit serious crimes, less likely to place high demands on the public health care system, and less likely to be enrolled in welfare assistance programs.” 
However that may be, the Ohio House budget would slash funding for public education far below what’s called for under a 2021 plan to make it sufficient to meet the requirements of the Ohio Constitution. 
The Fair School Funding Plan calls for $666 million in new spending on public education. The Republican House budget would provide only $226 million.

(Photo from Akron Police body camera footage.)Ohio activists are starting to gather signatures to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would end qualified immunity — a protection for police and other government officials that prevents citizens from suing them.
When an Akron police officer caused an accident that crushed four cars, Steven Rockich expected some sort of remedy.
“I could not believe my eyes, man, I was like what the heck?” Rockich said, evaluating the damage.
But he didn’t get it.
He told us in January that even though the officer was found liable for causing the damage, he would be the one paying the price.
“The towing that I had to pay out-of-pocket was over $600, and then my car was worth over $5,000, so it’s all out the window — just smashed,” Rockich said.
State law prevents government officials from being held liable for civil damages unless the victim can prove that the officer violated their constitutional rights, which activist Marije Rivers explained is an uphill battle.
“It’s hard to prove that exact, because you would initially need full evidence, with redactions, with opinions, with point of views, audio,” Rivers said. “It’s so hard to get it exactly right.”
This is why she is collecting signatures for the Ohio Coalition to End Qualified Immunity — and is working to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot. The proposal would take away this protection and allow victims to sue for damages.

WEWS investigators found thousands of at-fault crashes by emergency vehicles piling up across the state during the past five years.
But Ohio Fraternal Order of Police President Jay McDonald argued that this is necessary to shield officers who are just trying to do their jobs.
“If I am worried about whether or not I’m going to get sued and lose my house and put my family at risk, then I’m also going to be worried about whether I should proactively police that neighborhood,” McDonald said.
But when it comes to car crash damage, we asked who should pay for it.
“Well, right now there’s existing frameworks to pay for that,” he responded. “We don’t need a complete expansion of litigation rights that could cause taxes to go up, could cause cops to cease working in this profession.”
Rivers said current legal remedies tend to be ineffective.
“The city will fund and insure what they want to fund and insure,” she said.
But this won’t just hurt police, McDonald warned.
“This impacts children’s services workers, teachers, custodial people at schools,” he said. “We’re exposing the lunch lady at your local elementary school to litigation that doesn’t exist today.”
Attorney General Dave Yost has also been fighting against the amendment, but recently, a federal court forced him to approve the petition, so that Rivers and others can start collecting the about 415,000 signatures needed by early July.
Until then, Rockich is footing the bill.
“They said that they’re not going to pay anything for what just happened because it’s full immunity,” he said.
Activists are trying to get it on the November ballot.

(Illustration by Eric Thomas for Kansas Reflector)Lace up your court shoes because April is National Pickleball Month. It’s also — apparently — National Afternoon Tea Month, National Brunch Month and National Canine Fitness Month.
So maybe you should be playing pickleball with Fido before a brunch date and afternoon tea?
Today I am petitioning for a new designation for April: it’s National School Statistics Month.
This is the time of the year when educational statistics and rankings scream for our attention. For our uniquely American media that rank schools against each other, it’s also the moment to pit business schools against each other and even teachers against each other.
As Fido knows, it’s a dog eat dog world.
In the upcoming days, high school seniors who have been accepted at a few different universities will choose their home for next year. They will consider the rank of one school against another: “Should I go to the No. 159 school in the nation because they are providing a greater scholarship than the No. 102 school in the nation?”
Meanwhile, rising juniors and seniors in high school are consulting rankings and lists to map out their college visits this summer and fall.
The most popular months for parents to move houses, according to multiple moving companies, are during the summer. (Welcome to National Moving Month in a few days when May begins!) Parents will be consulting school rankings, graduation rates and student-teacher ratios. Choosing a new neighborhood is really about choosing the best neighborhood elementary school.
April is also a common month for students choosing a course schedule for next fall. While some college students choose classes based on personal or professional interests, they also are scouting the professors and teachers who typically teach each course. Who gives the most homework? Whose class would you take again?
The internet will give you those answers too.
The trouble with all of these rankings, as they compare schools who are wildly different, is the air of certainty that they promise. Consider the statistical precision offered by certifying one high school as the No. 1 school over a No. 2 school. Let alone — gasp! — a No. 7 school.
Even with the many algorithms, reviews and databases that ranking services promise to employ, the rankings are often misleading.
 
RateMyProfessors.com
College instructors share a queasy feeling when this website gets mentioned. Those who are bold enough to log on to RateMyProfessors.com quickly get the feeling that they are a plate of fries being reviewed on Yelp! (“Too salty indeed!”)
What insights does RateMyProfessors.com provide from University of Kansas students who previously took my courses?

3 out of 5 for quality, 3 out of 5 for difficulty: “Eric Thomas was a good but not great professor. Had some meh moments but also some fun ones.”
5 out of 5 for quality, 2 out of 5 for difficulty: “MY KING. its (sic) a big class and you get put in a random group and that group will grade you at the end of the quarter but most of you (sic) grade is daily group class work and tests. GREAT GUY”
4 out of 5 for quality, 4 out of 5 for difficulty: “Hes (sic) alright”

Clearly, I need to teach a bit more grammar. And need to elevate my “meh” energy.
Yesterday during office hours, a student told me she had been unsure about registering for my class. In the end, she said she signed up for it only after scrolling those RateMyProfessors.com reviews. I’m wondering which glowing (or angry) review hooked her.
The website provides a preposterous sample, of course. After teaching more than 2,000 students during 11 years at KU, 43 have left these curt reviews summing up 16 weeks in my class with a few syllables.
I can’t argue that students should trust other students because they often have smart observations. But as any instructor knows, the students who drench you in feedback are usually the A+ achievers who loved your class, or the students who failed and see the rating as a chance to exact revenge.
Hence, a 2023 review of me: “When you talk to him in private, he could not possibly care less about you.” Ouch.
We can be grateful for the progress that RateMyProfessors.com no longer uses “hotness” as a part of their rating system. For years, students used the site’s infamous chili pepper to rate the attractiveness and wardrobe of their instructors. Thankfully, that yucky metric fell away in 2018.
And yes, I did try to use the Wayback Machine to see if I could recall how many chili peppers I had earned. But alas, that metric is lost. (And yes, my vanity score just skyrocketed. How many mirrors did I earn?)
 
Niche.com rankings
This week, the Kansas City Star relayed rankings from the educational website Niche. The headline promises empirical certainty: “These 15 high schools are some of the highest ranked in the KC area for 2025.”
The results are summarized with the top 10 overall schools, according to the website, which boasts: “Niche has the most comprehensive data on U.S. schools and neighborhoods. We rigorously analyze dozens of public data sets and over 100 million reviews and survey responses to help you understand what a place is really like.”
I am not convinced. The data are opaque to visitors. Average ACT and SAT test scores are reported — but it’s unclear when students achieved these scores. The website summarizes the “Culture & Safety” of some schools with as few as 10 survey responses for a particular school. To trust a website like this — and report its findings as fact — demands more transparency.
Whether you trust them or not, the rankings tout suburban schools that hug the Kansas-Missouri state line as being the 10 best. Half of the schools are private and charge more than $15,000 per year. It’s a mash-up of schools from affluent areas charging more than $50,000 for a high school education. They should be good.
That being said, I have personally visited each of these schools, and they are excellent — but in totally different ways. It’s laughable to rank them, from a private high school with fewer than 200 students to a public high school with more than 1,700 students, this bluntly.
 
College rankings
U.S. News and World Report invented both the folly and fortune of these college rankings. Each September, their rankings trumpet the best universities in the nation while dunking on others. (Today’s teens shopping for colleges aren’t likely to know that U.S. News and World Report was once a magazine you saw many places, but mostly in doctor’s and dentist’s offices.)
Other publications have responded with rankings to rival and mock the lists from U.S. News and World Report. In its 20th year, Washington Monthly released its rankings, calling them “our answer to U.S. News and World Report, which relies on crude and easily manipulated measures of wealth, exclusivity, and prestige. We rank liberal arts colleges — four-year institutions that award almost exclusively bachelor’s degrees and that focus on arts and sciences rather than professional programs — based on their contribution to the public good.”
The numbers are right there, as transparent as we readers would hope. And the mission is precise. Rather than trying to summarize the entirety of a university, the staff hopes to evaluate “social mobility, research, and promoting public service.”
If those are your values, the rankings suggest, these are your metrics.
Washington Monthly goes further, providing even more specific rankings, “America’s Best and Worst Colleges for Women in STEM.” According to the rankings, Fort Hays State University is the second worst in the country in graduating women with a chemistry degree and 10th worst in graduating women with a biology degree. Wichita State’s electrical engineering ranks near the bottom of that discipline with only 8.6 of graduates who are female. I wish that I could report that any Kansas schools achieved spots on the “best” list.
The ruthlessly narrow goal of these rankings is admirable. Washington Monthly is saying: “We will put a specific band of statistics in context for you. We can’t tell you everything about a university, but you can trust us on this.” The publication’s humility and focus are rare in the business of publishing educational rankings. 
It’s hard to be humble when everyone wants to be No. 1.

(Stock photo from Getty Images)More than 50 years ago, the Ohio Environmental Council was formed by a group of ordinary Ohioans. Their motivation? Making sure events like the Cuyahoga River catching fire never happened again. 
Prior to the establishment of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and its state-level counterpart, the Ohio EPA, Ohio’s water resources were under serious threat. It was so filled with industrial pollutants, the Cuyahoga River — a body of water — caught fire, not once, but multiple times during the 1960s. During this same time period, Ohio’s Great Lake Erie was declared dead. 
Our air quality wasn’t much better. The air quality in Youngstown, Cleveland, and Steubenville was among the worst in the nation. Industrial waste was dumped on private property, while even more ended up in poorly lined dumpsites, contaminating our soil and leaching into groundwater. Fifty years ago, our national bird, the bald eagle, was on the verge of extinction.
In 1970, Richard Nixon established the U.S. EPA with a mission to clean up pollution, establish environmental standards and regulations, and develop policies for protecting the environment. 
Today, we enjoy markedly better air quality than we did fifty years ago. People row and fish in our state’s lakes and rivers. We’ve cleaned up many industrial brownfields and former mine sites. We’ve adopted highways and raised awareness about the importance of litter prevention. Bald eagles are routinely spotted nesting in counties around the state. The days of private landowners uncovering barrels of toxic sludge in their backyards are long gone.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Or are they? 
According to U.S. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, “‘President Trump has been very outspoken about his desire for Americans to be able to access clean air and clean water. We want air, land, water to be cleaner, safer, healthier.” 
And yet, at the same time, Zeldin has announced a sweeping plan to allow far more heavy metals and toxins into the air from power plants, relax rules prohibiting mercury and arsenic from getting into our drinking water, and make it harder for neighborhoods downwind, or downstream of pollution to do anything about it.
We are old enough to remember an Ohio where bald eagle sightings were rare. Where children weren’t allowed to swim in or even touch lake waters. And where smog, haze and air quality alerts were the norm and not the exception. Without the federal government’s oversight of polluters, we risk those days returning.
In the absence of federal support, Ohio’s state and local government agencies will have to pick up the slack. Do we have the resources to tackle this enormous challenge?
We pay taxes so our government will provide the basic services and protections we need to keep our communities safe, healthy, and livable. Without the US EPA upholding its end of the bargain, it’s hard to see how we’re going to protect the progress Ohioans fought so hard to make.
Ohioans deserve better than a return to the bad old days of pollution.

He thinks of a boy who, before finding Shapiro’s clinic, was in and out of emergency rooms and intensive care units because of severe asthma attacks, instead of competing in soccer games and studying for exams. The boy’s parents were losing hours and pay at work with the frequent ER visits.
Shapiro, who is Latino, works at a federally qualified health care center, a clinic for low-income patients. Most of his patients are people of color on Medicaid, and roughly a quarter of them are children.
Research shows Latino and Black family physicians are more likely to see Medicaid patients compared with their white and Asian counterparts. Experts say the Medicaid cuts Congress is weighing would strap health care centers that rely on already-low Medicaid reimbursements, disproportionately affecting communities of color and the physicians they rely on.










It's not just health insurance. It's a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.


– Dr. Ilan Shapiro


Of the 72 million people covered by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities, more than half are people of color, with Black and Hispanic people disproportionately represented on the rolls.
Black and Hispanic patients have a higher risk of conditions such as high blood pressure, kidney disease and certain cancers, making health care access crucial.
Congressional Republicans are considering $880 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid spending to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. Conservatives have long argued that Medicaid is too expensive. They assert its expansion under the Affordable Care Act to more working adults has diverted too much money toward nondisabled people, taking resources away from vulnerable populations the program was originally intended to help.
But clinicians and policy analysts say the federal Medicaid cuts could have an especially detrimental impact on vulnerable enrollees, including children, older adults and people with disabilities or chronic illnesses, as states are forced to find savings to fill the gap.
Black maternal health advocates, researchers press on amid federal funding cuts

One GOP proposal targeting Medicaid expansion could lead to reductions in children’s health insurance programs, according to a February report by the Urban Institute. The think tank estimates that proposed cuts to federal Medicaid expansion spending could increase the number of uninsured kids by 11.8%.
“I’m deeply afraid,” said Shapiro. “It’s not just health insurance. It’s a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.”
 Bias and language barriers

Just 6% of U.S. physicians are Latino and 5% are Black, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Sustaining the relatively few medical practices with Black and Hispanic providers is important amid evidence that racial bias, lack of access to culturally competent care and language barriers lead to poorer health outcomes or access.
For example, analyses have shown Black patients are less likely to be prescribed pain medication, and some clinicians hold false ideas that Black patients have a higher pain tolerance. Nearly 1 in 3 Black, Hispanic and multiracial women reported mistreatment in medical settings during pregnancy and delivery, such as receiving no help when asking for it or being shouted at, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.
Language barriers, which Latino communities are more likely to face, are also associated with poorer health or limited access to health care.
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.

“We understand the language and cultural concordance and the improved outcomes,” said Dr. Linda Mirdamadi, an adjunct clinical assistant professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine who serves on the National Hispanic Medical Association’s board of directors. “There’s a sense of trust.”
Mirdamadi said federal cuts to Medicaid would lead to loss of preventive care for her large, diverse community.
“If they don’t have access to health care, they’re not going to have the access to chronic disease prevention, to vaccines, to cancer prevention screening,” she said. “It is going to just increase the disparity gaps that already exist.”
 ‘Ripple effect’

Dr. Roger Mitchell, president-elect of the National Medical Association, which represents Black physicians, said a widespread loss of Medicaid coverage would affect everybody, even people with private insurance. People without health coverage often don’t have primary doctors and forgo preventive care, resulting in more trips to the emergency room. That can lead to longer wait times at ERs for everyone, regardless of their health insurance.
Mitchell also pointed out that Medicaid reimbursements are a major funding stream for hospitals and clinics that see a lot of enrollees. Without that money, many of those providers might be forced to scale back their services or close.
“The ripple effect is enormous,” said Mitchell, who heads Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C., where about 40% of patients are covered by Medicaid. “This is an issue that’s not just affecting one portion of the U.S. populace, but all of us, and has the potential to have huge harm.”
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

Dr. Zita Magloire is a family physician, but she also offers obstetric care along with two OB-GYNs at Cairo Medical Care in the south Georgia city of Cairo. The city is the county seat of Grady County, which has about 26,000 residents, almost 30% of whom are Black.
Her practice is one of the few in the area that takes Medicaid for obstetric care, she noted, and serves many Central American immigrant patients who drive from the surrounding rural areas to her clinic. When another practice in the area started cutting services, her center absorbed those patients.
“There’s not a lot of providers that accept Medicaid,” she said. “What does that look like? Well, they [patients] show up with no prenatal care — and then, you have very high-risk patients.”
Back in Los Angeles, the boy whose family found Shapiro’s clinic is now a teenager. He received stable asthma care there and got Medicaid coverage.
“He started having a medical home. Everything changed. The ER visits and the intensive care unit visits changed to soccer games,” Shapiro said. Having coverage, he continued, “makes a huge impact for the entire community.”

She and the lawmakers urged the immediate return of her husband from a maximum security prison in El Salvador. (Photo by Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)As the whole world is now aware, on March 12, 2025, Kilmar Abrego Garcia was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents; three days later, he was sent to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT). While the Trump administration initially stated that Mr. Garcia’s removal to El Salvador was an administrative error, it now alleges that Garcia was a member of MS-13 to justify his removal.
Mr. Garcia was sent to El Salvador despite a 2019 court order that barred the U.S. from deporting him to that country, based on a finding that he would be persecuted if returned there. He was sent to El Salvador without receiving any form of due process prior to his removal. And he was sent to El Salvador despite his wife Jennifer Vasquez Sura’s pleas that he be returned to her and their children.
Now reports have emerged that in 2021, Ms. Sura filed for a protective order against Mr. Garcia. A protective order is a civil remedy that enables a court to order that a person not assault, threaten, harass, or otherwise abuse the person who has requested the order, with whom that person generally has a familial or intimate relationship.
The protective order can also put into place a number of other conditions designed to foster safety for a person who has been abused by an intimate partner or family member, including requirements that a person have no contact with and stay away from another’s home, school, or workplace. In Maryland, the issuance of a final order of protection requires either that the person alleged to have done harm agrees to the order or that a judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence that abuse has occurred.

Views of writers are their own.




What Ms. Sura received, however, was a temporary protective order. Temporary orders are emergency measures put into place to provide safety until such time as a final hearing can be held. Temporary protective orders require less proof than final protective.
A court must find that there are reasonable grounds to believe that abuse has occurred. That order can be issued based on the testimony of the person who has been harmed and any supporting evidence they might have. Temporary orders are ex parte orders—only one side appears at the hearing.
There has never been a final contested hearing on the allegations raised by Ms. Sura because Ms. Sura — like many people subjected to abuse — chose not to pursue the final order.  Ms. Sura has subsequently said that she and Mr. Garcia were able to address their issues through counseling and that their marriage grew stronger as a result.
The Trump administration has used Ms. Sura’s protective order filing to undermine her claim that Mr. Garcia is a good man, a loving father. The protective order case has become a smoke screen to deflect attention from the administration’s blatantly illegal actions.
The administration’s actions will almost certainly dissuade people from seeking protective orders. Immigrant victims of violence are already reluctant to seek protective orders for fear of the impact on their partners and their families. Knowing that your partner could disappear into a prison that has been described as a “gulag,” a prison that is well known for torture and inhumane conditions, will prevent people from asking for protection that they may desperately need.
A temporary protective order is not grounds for deportation. Even a final protective order, entered after a contested hearing and a judge’s ruling that abuse has occurred, is not grounds for deportation. Nothing about Ms. Sura’s request for assistance from the court justifies the administration’s actions.
Intimate partner violence is frequently used as a justification for regressive carceral policies. Concerns about domestic violence have been used to justify opposition to bail reform and discovery reform in New York and sentencing reform in Maryland and Oklahoma.
The anti-domestic violence movement has recognized its contribution to the rise of mass incarceration and the disproportionate impact mass incarceration has on communities of color. Left unchallenged, Mr. Garcia’s removal becomes another example of how the anti-violence movement has allowed domestic violence to be co-opted in the name of punishment and persecution.
The failure of the anti-violence movement to stand up for the rule of law in this case will further embolden those who use the anti-violence movement to serve their own ends.
The Trump administration hopes that the domestic violence allegations against Mr. Garcia will divert us from the illegality of their actions. We should not be diverted. And the anti-violence movement should say so.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_5508-e1744228152867.jpg,,,2025-04-25 05:00:27.117092

As the Times is wont to do, the piece was full of quotes and suppositions from anonymous sources.
“Interviews with more than three dozen of Ms. Harris’s advisers, former aides, allies and friends reveal a politician — known, as much as anything, for her caution — standing at perhaps her most fateful crossroads yet,” the Times said in a piece with four bylines.
“After 22 years as an elected official, she must decide whether, or how, to continue her political career in an environment that was remade by her defeat.
“Some Harris aides believe she would automatically be the front-runner in a crowded primary field, thanks to her name recognition and wide network of donors and supporters.
“But many more Democrats argue against another Harris-for-President bid: The 2028 election will be a contest for the party’s future in which she would be perceived as a figure of the past, the reasoning goes. Others say Democrats will not nominate another woman, fearing the country is too sexist for her to win.”
The article more or less pointed to a gubernatorial run rather than waiting for 2028.
“Ms. Harris has good reason for leaning toward a run for governor, according to people who have spoken with her,” the Times said. “She has watched with horror as institutions Democrats care about — universities, law firms and more — have caved under pressure. And she believes that as governor of the nation’s most populous blue state, she would have a powerful platform from which to push back against Mr. Trump and his policies, and to defend Democratic priorities and values.”
There are two things wrong with the article.
The first is that it cast Harris’ situation almost entirely in terms of advancing her political career, an example of political journalism’s tendency to cover politics as something like reporting on sports events — who’s winning, who’s losing, who’s up and who’s down — rather than a prelude to governance.
That approach, while appealing to political junkies, completely ignores the issues that a politician might face if he or she is fortunate enough to be elected. In this case, the Times implied that the 2026 election for a governor who would lead the world’s fourth-largest economy is just about opposition to Donald Trump and nothing else.
The article contained not one sentence about the California issues Harris would inherit from Gavin Newsom were she to become governor — such thorny matters as a perpetual housing shortage, homelessness, poverty, an uncertain water supply, educational deficiencies and chronic state budget deficits.

Commentary 
As Democratic candidates for governor increase, they wait for Harris to decide 

by Dan Walters 





Having ignored those issues, all of which predate Trump, the Times article’s second deficiency is that it contained nothing about Harris’ abilities, or lack thereof, to confront them. And there is good reason to doubt whether she would be up to the job.
During her climb up the political ladder, Harris’ record was mixed — at best.  As the state’s attorney general she was best known for tightly orchestrated media events rather than substantive action. She even ducked the Capitol’s debates about changing the criminal justice system.
As a senator she authored no noteworthy legislation, not even on California-centered matters, while the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein steadfastly carried the state’s political water. Harris’ campaign for president in 2020 was a disaster, and after being chosen as Joe Biden’s running mate she did little of note as vice president.
Governing an extremely complex state such as California is a daunting task, as any past governor could attest, not a consolation prize for losing a presidential contest.

For chief House budget architect Rep. Jeff Thompson, the budget was one that “lives within our means” following a grim financial forecast the week before.
House Speaker Todd Huston gave a robust defense — and rare floor appearance — in favor of the legislation after nearly two hours of debate.

“This budget does so much. It continues to invest in K-12 education in every way. Even with a surprise shortfall in revenue, we made sure we protected K-12 and we did that,” said Huston, R-Fishers. “… House Bill 1001 builds on … what’s taking place in Indiana. It builds on that success. When we see a challenge — and when we get a challenge — we meet it and we excel through it.” 
Democrats largely opposed the measure, citing the lack of funds for child care and Medicaid waiver waitlists while wealthy Hoosiers get tax dollars to send their children to private schools.
“This budget doesn’t just keep our government running, it impacts the real people — the Hoosiers — that are depending on us. They’re counting on us to pass a budget that, yes, will get balanced. But, more importantly, one that reflects their needs and values,” said Sen. Rodney Pol, D-Chesterton. “… Unfortunately, this budget falls short of that.”
Included in the last version of the budget is an expansion of school choice voucher eligibility, meaning that even families earning more than $220,000 — an estimated 3,000 students — will qualify.
One member from each party crossed caucus lines in the House, but it moved out of the chamber on a 66-27 vote. 
The bill fared roughly the same in the Senate, where two Republicans voted against the proposal but one Democrat supported it, for a final vote of 39-11. 
It now moves to Gov. Mike Braun for his signature. 
 Democrats lament funding shortfalls

The budget didn’t only impact K-12 education, but also the state’s various higher education institutions.
Rep. Matt Pierce, a Democrat from Bloomington, railed against last-minute language, slipped in without public testimony, that would give Braun complete control over the Indiana University Board of Trustees. 
Other provisions would require reviews of tenured professors for productivity and publicly posted syllabi. 
“April 24, 2025, is a date that will live in infamy,” said Pierce, who is employed by IU. “The faculty of our state universities were suddenly and deliberately attacked by the Republican supermajority.”
  Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, speaks from the floor on April 25, 2025. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Rep. Chris Campbell highlighted another $1 million budget cut to a housing first program. Those dollars caused homelessness rates to drop by 14% in 2017, she said. 
“Without this program our communities rely on to assist the unhoused, we should expect homelessness to not only continue but to likely increase,” said the West Lafayette Democrat. “I don’t understand how a legislature that has spent a lot of this session trying to criminalize homelessness is now trying to eliminate the one tool we have been using since 2017.”
The latter portion refers to an effort that would crack down on homelessness by making “street camping” on public property a crime. That language appeared in a handful of different bills but didn’t cross the finish line before the legislators left Indianapolis. 
Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis, criticized the elimination of public broadcasting and trails funding. She said she would have supported cuts to the line items in light of the state’s finances, but “zeroing out these programs is a mistake that tells us they may never come back.”
But the narrowed eligibility for subsidized child care would make the shortage of options for parents worse, not better, she said. 
“We can’t afford to make that cut in this budget. This is actually, exactly the moment we should be stepping up our investment in child care. Or, at least maintaining it,” she said. “But, instead, this budget steps back, choosing to invest in the wealthiest who don’t need it instead of those who do.”
In response to Democratic concerns in the Senate, Sen. Ryan Misher, the bill’s sponsor, said the measure builds for the future.
“I know there’s really no one going home feeling like they had a big win here — not a year that anybody would feel like it’s a big win,” concluded the Mishawaka Republican. “I think the best way to look at it is that it could have been much worse.”
 Republicans add their concerns

While no House Republicans other than Thompson and Huston spoke on the budget, a handful of Senate Republicans chimed in — including two with several qualms.
Sen. Mike Young criticized his fellow Republicans for adding “14 pieces of language that have nothing to do with the budget,” including language on carbon sequestration. He also bemoaned individual line item increases while taxes on gas continue to grow. 

“There’s all kinds of things in this current budget,” said Young. “… I think I would’ve looked at more of the cutting than I would about more of the spending which they did.”
Additionally, cigarette taxes will increase by $2 per pack, with proportional increases for other forms of tobacco. Those dollars will bring in an estimated $850 million in the next biennium.
Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, said he was struggling to support that tax increase but focused on the positives.
“There’s too much good in there to not vote for this budget,” he said.
While Young voted against the measure, Sen. Vaneta Becker, R-Evansville, supported it — despite her reservations.
“We don’t have enough money for health care and for Medicaid, but we can give a millionaire a voucher to send their kids to private school. It’s unconscionable,” said Becker. “… But the biggest thing I’m disappointed in is the Dolly Parton Imagination Library and the fact that we didn’t fund it.”
That line item was $6 million in the last budget cycle. First Lady Maureen Braun has vowed to raise those funds.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA federal judge in Atlanta is set to rule on a complaint filed by a group of 133 international college students who say the administration of President Donald Trump illegally and capriciously tried to take away their ability to study in the United States.
Following a Thursday hearing, U.S. District Court Judge Victoria Calvert said she will decide by the end of the month whether to issue a ruling protecting the students, who include 26 Georgia students studying at schools including the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech, Georgia State University and Emory University.
Last week, Calvert issued a 14-day temporary order allowing the students to keep studying.
The students say they were not given any warning before being cut off from their Student and Exchange Visitor Information System records, or SEVIS, which is maintained by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and allows them to continue studying in the states.
The students say ICE did not tell them why their SEVIS statuses were revoked, but many suspect it was in relation to minor run-ins with law enforcement in the states, sometimes years ago. Many of the students report misdemeanor charges including public intoxication or reckless driving. Attorneys for the students say none of them have been accused of any crime that could result in SEVIS suspension under ICE’s own rules.
Much of Thursday’s arguments dealt with whether Calvert’s court is the right venue to deal with the plaintiffs who are not studying in Georgia.
Attorney David Powell with the U.S. Attorney’s Office argued that each plaintiff has unique circumstances and their cases should be heard separately.
Attorney Charles Kuck, representing the students, said it makes sense for the students to join their cases together because they all faced the same issue: the unexpected revocation of their SEVIS records.
Kuck said his office has heard from nearly 700 people from across the country not currently involved in the case but in similar situations as his clients and plans to file a class action lawsuit in the coming days.
Kuck said there are at least 40 lawsuits pending across the country and at least 17 other courts have put temporary orders into place like the one Calvert issued last week.
“When you think about it, there’s anywhere from 4,000 to 5,000, maybe 7,000 of these students,” he said to reporters outside the courthouse after the hearing. “Do the courts and U.S. attorneys really want to defend 7,000 lawsuits? They’re going to lose every single one of them, because the things we talked about today weren’t about the individuals, they were about the group. And, clearly, the individual is going to be protected in this. So we’re going to bring a class action and try to protect the whole group.”

Unlike any budget year in memory, they are doing so in the context of the threat of unprecedented federal funding cuts and a shaky economy that could have a devastating impact on people across Connecticut, including on the community nonprofits that serve the most vulnerable in our state.
It’s understandable that some believe the current climate means the state should dig in, backfill federal cuts only and protect the reserves we have. But there are two good reasons that make this the right time to go a step further and make investments in health and human service programs that help Connecticut’s people keep their heads above water and healthy.

Gian Carl Casa
First, after more than a decade of underfunding, nonprofit community programs are already closing and waiting lists are growing. Federal cuts would exacerbate an existing crisis, turning it into disaster for thousands of people here.
And to be clear, community nonprofits are not charities. They are highly skilled organizations that contract with the state to provide vital services, including mental health and addiction treatment, day and residential programs for people with disabilities, shelter for families, and support for skill training and job search for people leaving incarceration.
Second, if the economy slows and heads towards recession, the needs of residents will go up;  recessions are when services are most needed.  Fears of a recession should not mean Connecticut holds off on spending on programs that serve our most vulnerable people. A failure to invest in community nonprofits will limit access to vital services.
Today there is more than $4 billion in Connecticut’s “Rainy Day Fund.”  A projected surplus this fiscal year of $1.8 billion will bring the total to more than $6 billion.  It’s time to use those taxpayer funds to support programs that support Connecticut’s residents. This isn’t just a rainy day – it’s already storming and federal cuts would make it a monsoon.
Our state has a bipartisan history of caring. We appreciate that all sides of the budget discussions are looking for the best way to help people. But it is not the time to acquiesce in advance to federal cuts, it is a time to make sure they don’t worsen current problems.
More than a half-million Connecticut residents depend on community nonprofits. Tens of thousands of residents work to serve them.  Our state leaders need to meet the challenges for those vulnerable people by responding to the existing crisis and anticipating any federal spending cuts with investment
Already, the status quo doesn’t meet the need; the situation will be dire if demand for services increases due to a slowing economy.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-25 04:01:09+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump’s poodles on Fox News,Mordechai Gordon,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/25/trumps-poodles-on-fox-news/,Ingraham and Hannity long ago abandoned the mission of a free and robust media for the sake of operating as lackeys and cheerleaders for President Trump.,"Watching Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity cover the Trump tariff debacle recently demonstrated that Fox’s evening lineup consists not of real reporters committed to the truth but of two high-powered anchors competing for the title of the President’s poodle.
On April 9, the day the stock market soared following the administration’s announcement that it was pausing the hefty tariffs on dozens of countries around the globe, Ingraham informed her Fox viewers that Trump had just made a “brilliant move,” that he was a genius, and that all of his critics had egg on their faces.
Not to be outdone, Hannity used his Fox platform to refer to Trump’s backing down following one of the largest market meltdowns in years as the “art of the deal” while insisting that it was a huge win for the President and the country.
Never mind that the stock market was still down by thousands of points from just before Trump’s decision to impose the largest tariffs we have seen in decades. Never mind that Trump has launched a trade war with China with no end in sight, a war for which the Eastern superpower seems better prepared to navigate than the United States.
Ingraham and Hannity are apparently not concerned about the reality that millions of Americans close to retirement are down significant sums in their investment accounts. The two Fox anchors seemed oblivious to the fact that most leading economists are predicting higher prices for consumers as a result of Trump’s tariffs and many are warning about the threat of a global recession.
Fox’s evening anchors have betrayed the original slogan of the news channel, which was “fair and balanced” reporting. Many of its news broadcasters like Ingraham and Hannity do not even pretend to be fair and balanced, opting instead to feed their viewers a steady diet of pro-Trump propaganda.
For example, if you were expecting to hear any real critique of the current administration over their handling of the Signal chat breach (in which the editor of the Atlantic Magazine was added to a group chat of Cabinet members that were discussing plans to attack Yemen), you would not find it in the Fox Evening News. Instead, what you got to see was Laura Ingraham interviewing Mike Waltz, the official that had added the reporter to the chat, while the two used this opportunity to trash the Atlantic Magazine editor who disclosed this security breach.
Likewise, if you were hoping to learn why the Trump administration, with the help of DOGE, fired thousands of essential workers from the Department of Defense, Health and Human Services, or Veteran Affairs, only to rehire these workers days later, watching Hannity’s program on Fox will not help you. With Hannity, you are more likely to get a softball interview of Trump and Musk in which the host heaps praise on the two men.

For years now, Ingraham and Hannity have echoed the Trump mantra that immigrants are invading and taking over our country even though the evidence does not support this claim. The two Fox anchors never bothered to contradict Trump and Vance during the 2024 Presidential election cycle when they made the outrageous allegation that Haitian migrants living in Springfield Ohio were eating the dogs of that community. By serving as proxies for the Trump administration, Ingraham and Hannity use their nightly shows to misinform their millions of viewers and insult their intelligence.
We should not fault Ingraham and Hannity or the Fox media corporation for offering their viewers a conservative angle on the news of the day. Most media outlets bring a particular perspective and value system to bear on the issues they cover and how they choose to tell their stories.
However, in a democratic society, the press and, media in general, are expected to report on the facts and convey to its readers and viewers accurate information. More than that, good media is supposed to hold the government accountable for its decisions and actions, which is why we refer to the media as the fourth branch of government.
Ingraham and Hannity long ago abandoned the mission of a free and robust media in a democratic society for the sake of operating as lackeys and cheerleaders for President Trump. Whether they are doing this to curry favor with Trump, to raise the ratings of the Fox network, or to benefit themselves financially is not important. 
What is critical to understand is that in functioning as the President’s poodles they have betrayed their responsibility to their audience, to the profession of journalism, as well as to our democracy.

For years, we’ve watched neighboring states attract the type of large-scale investments that drive sustained economic growth, create jobs, and redefine urban centers. Connecticut now has a generational opportunity to do the same in Bridgeport and deliver major benefits for the region and state.
The proposed $1 billion+ mixed-use waterfront development drives economic revitalization, addresses the critical shortage of housing, and stands as an optimistic statement about building a better future for Connecticut.

Fred Carstensen
The economic impact analysis of this project conducted by the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis at UConn (CCEA) makes a powerful argument that this project will pay large dividends in jobs, housing, new tax revenues, and, critically, visibility. 
The numbers speak for themselves.
A multi-billion-dollar boost to the economy
A 10,000-seat stadium that would be home to Connecticut’s MLS NEXT Pro soccer team, a planned National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) team, and a venue for year-round entertainment, is the anchor that makes this entire vision possible. Without it, the surrounding (much larger) investments in housing, retail, and public spaces will not materialize.

The development would be one of the largest capital projects in Connecticut’s history, with nearly three-fourths of funding coming from private sources. Total economic impact is projected to reach $2.2 billion, sustaining nearly 700 new full-time jobs annually on average. This isn’t speculation – it’s a data-driven projection of how large-scale, mixed-use developments can drive prosperity. 
Beyond job creation, the financial returns to the state and local governments are undeniable. The CCEA analysis projects generation of $600 million in incremental tax revenue, far exceeding the level of public investment. In a time when Connecticut is seeking sustainable revenue sources without burdening taxpayers, this development represents a win-win scenario. 
An alternative scenario featuring a 22,500-seat stadium that would host a top-tier men’s Major League Soccer (MLS) team and an NWSL team remains on the table. Total economic impact increases to $3.4 billion with the larger stadium, with over 1,300 new jobs added annually and over $1 billion in new tax revenue.
Critically, the rapidly growing engagement with and excitement around soccer would draw thousands from across the region including from neighboring states to Bridgeport and Connecticut. That dynamic will deliver benefits well beyond what the CCEA study can fully capture. 
A mixed-use vision that solves pressing challenges 
At its core, this project is about building a vibrant, interconnected, welcoming community. With over 1,000 new apartment units, the development directly addresses Connecticut’s housing shortage, providing modern living spaces – including affordable live-work units – in a transit-friendly location. A four-star hotel will attract visitors and boost tourism revenue, while the retail and dining spaces will offer new opportunities for small businesses and entrepreneurs. 
The inclusion of a public park and riverwalk ensures that this project benefits everyone, not just those who live or work nearby. By aligning with the broader Trust for the Public Land’s 20-mile shoreline pathway project, the project is making a long-term investment in walkability, health, recreation, and environmental stewardship. 
Catalyst for additional investment  
The chosen site – currently a neglected, underutilized area – represents an opportunity to connect Bridgeport’s waterfront with its downtown core, raising property values and drawing new investment. With direct access to the train station, ferry terminal, major highways and bus routes, the development will serve as an accessible destination for residents throughout Connecticut and neighboring states, boosting quality of life. 
It will also serve as a highly visible symbol of a resurgent, reimagined Connecticut; a clear signal to investors, businesses, and residents that Connecticut is ready to compete. It’s a chance to move beyond outdated perceptions and embrace a modern vision for economic growth and community engagement. 
Metro markets across the country have leveraged sports-anchored mixed-use developments to reinvigorate urban centers, enhance their visibility, attract businesses, and cultivate a sense of local pride. Connecticut needs development like this to assert itself as a dynamic market unto itself – a place where people want to live, work and play – not just a drive-thru state connecting New York and Boston. This development would make Connecticut nationally visible and invigorate its image. 
Defining moment for Connecticut 
This development is not just another construction project – it’s a moment for redefining Connecticut’s future. The economic case is clear: billions in impact, thousands of jobs, and hundreds of millions in new revenue. The social and cultural benefits are equally compelling: improved housing, vibrant public spaces, and a premier sports venue that will put Connecticut on the map. 
As policymakers and the public weigh this opportunity, I urge them to consider what’s at stake. This development is a necessary investment in Connecticut’s long-term success. Uncertainty at the national level only underscores the importance of this project to Connecticut’s economy. Now is the time to be bold, to embrace growth, and to make this transformative vision a reality.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Lawmakers in the Washington state House advanced a bill addressing student and parental rights on Thursday, clearing the way for it to reach the governor’s desk. 
Debate around the bill has been some of the most divisive of this year’s session. The legislation largely stems from a citizen initiative lawmakers approved last year that granted certain rights to parents of public school students under age 18. This included the ability for parents to easily access school materials, such as textbooks, curriculum, and their child’s medical records. 
When Democrats agreed to pass that initiative, they said they would revisit it if it clashed with other state and federal laws. That’s what they said this year’s legislation was about. 
“​​It is creating a lot of confusion for parents, for educators, for the local school directors, all of whom are trying to independently interpret the law; that is a recipe for disaster,” said Rep. Sharon Tomiko Santos, D-Seattle, who chairs the House Education Committee. 
House Bill 1296 passed on a 59-39, party-line vote. 
“This bill creates that clarity to make sure that it’s not just some voices, but all voices are heard,” said Rep. Lillian Ortiz-Self, D-Mukilteo. 
Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, has not publicly taken a position on the bill.
On Thursday, when Democrats denied a Republican motion to invalidate changes made in the Senate, one Republican lawmaker rose to shout at the speaker presiding over the chamber, Rep. Tarra Simmons, D-Bremerton. 
“Not only do you take rules and break them,” yelled Rep. Jeremie Dufault, R-Selah, without being called upon. “You break your own rules!”
The sudden disruption derailed progress on the bill for hours. Dufault was not present in the chamber for the ensuing floor debate on the bill and participated virtually instead. And there was an increased Washington State Patrol presence in the House. 
Republicans have hammered the Democratic effort throughout the session, framing it as a strategy to gut the initiative.
“Parents are afraid,” said Rep. Deb Manjarrez, R-Wapato.
“They didn’t want information to be kept from them about their child, I don’t want information kept from me about my child,” she said.
The bill includes language around gender issues and diversity, equity and inclusion. Republicans previously introduced unsuccessful amendments to prevent transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports and entering girls’ locker rooms.  
Under the legislation, a new complaint process would be established, and the bill directs the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction to investigate complaints from students, parents, and others if schools fail to comply with state laws in areas like civil rights, nondiscrimination, harassment, and the physical restraint or isolation of students. 
The Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction would have to take numerous steps to intervene, with the consequences for school officials and districts becoming more severe in cases where they are found to be willfully disobeying state law. 
As a last resort, the office could withhold up to 20% of a district’s state funds and redirect that money toward resolving the issues the state has identified.  
Republicans claim this will take control away from local school districts and is too punitive toward schools.
The bill itself states: “Local control is not absolute and must also be balanced against the need to ensure all students have access to a healthy, safe learning environment that celebrates and protects their diversity and civil rights.”
School districts could not terminate, demote, suspend, or take any other negative action against a school employee for supporting students exercising their legal rights or for teaching about historically marginalized and underrepresented groups. 
Nine specific student rights are also outlined, such as the right to receive an education in a safe and supportive learning environment, free of harassment and bullying. The bill makes it clear that students are free to exercise constitutionally protected rights at school.
It also directs schools to develop promotional materials that incorporate these rights and make this information widely accessible to all students. 
The legislation keeps parts of the initiative that allow parents to review school curriculum and textbooks, and require school districts to “immediately” notify parents if a student is a victim of abuse, sexual misconduct, or assault. 
It would enable parents to opt their child out of any survey, analysis, or evaluation regarding political affiliations, sexual behavior, religious practices, and more. 
New parental rights would also be added, including ones for parents to be notified of their child’s unexcused absences and to engage in efforts to reduce those absences and to request information about special education programs and determine eligibility. 
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Monica Stonier, D-Vancouver, disagreed with Republicans’ criticisms. “While it may have been said that this bill guts parental rights that were passed from the initiative,” she said, “I believe this bill extends parental rights to more parents.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1586-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-25 00:02:35.029750

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)One-hundred-and-seven days after the General Assembly convened, this year’s legislative session came to a close early Friday morning after a marathon day at the Statehouse.
Dozens of bills sprinted across the finish line in the final days — and hours — before the sine die gavel strike brought policymaking business to a close.
Thursday alone saw more than two dozen proposals sent to Gov. Mike Braun’s desk.
And although the next state two-year state budget was the highlight of the night, debate swirled around other major bills, too, including those dealing with education “deregulation,” pharmaceutical pricing and public retiree bonuses.
Lawmakers also compromised on measures to connect Hoosiers to broadband; curb local energy project moratoriums; address K-12 chronic absenteeism; reinstate an A-F school grading system; and create separate bans on marijuana advertising and lab-cultivated meat.
Final education bills add — and delete — rules for schools
Tensions rose in the Senate before the chamber voted, barely, to send a Republican-backed education “deregulation” measure to the governor.
Heated debate on House Enrolled Act 1002 centered around last-minute conference committee changes, which included a dozen new code repeals. 
Sen. Mike Young, R-Indianapolis, was displeased with the rush to approve a long bill with new language.
“I can’t be in the dang room because I don’t know what’s in it,” Young said.

After the extremely narrow 27-21 vote, he approached the floor mic again — this time raising his voice.
“This is bull crap. You’ve got a 116-page bill. You’ve got 30 minutes to read it. We should have more time than that,” said Young, the only senator to refrain from voting. Twelve of his GOP colleagues cast unfavorable votes alongside Democrats. That’s after the House voted the bill out 61-25.
“I am so mad about this,” Young continued. “Our one job is to do what’s right for our constituents, and we can’t do it if we don’t have a chance to read the dang bill.”
Democrats, including Indianapolis Sen. Andrea Hunley, agreed that the bill required “a little bit more scrutiny.”
She referenced a repealed requirement for charter schools to publish economic interest statements. Also removed was an existing requirement for administrators to contact employment references before hiring teachers or other school personnel.
Despite its length, the legislation will strike multiple sections of current state education code.










This is bull crap. You've got a 116-page bill. You've got 30 minutes to read it. We should have more time than that.


– Sen. Mike Young, R-Indianapolis


Examples include the removal of dozens of “may” provisions, eliminating specific COVID-19 pandemic requirements and striking duplicate code. Republican bill author Rep. Bob Behning estimated that the cuts would reduce state education regulations by nearly 10%.
There were bipartisan concerns earlier in the session about the bill’s deletion of existing requirements for teachers to complete training in social and emotional learning (SEL) trauma-informed care and cultural competency.
Some of that language was added back in the final version to ensure teachers are prepared to “(support) students who have experienced trauma that may interfere with a student’s academic functioning.”
Other legislation to further address widespread chronic school absences among Hoosier students earned mostly bipartisan support in both chambers; an 84-8 vote in the House and a 48-2 in the Senate.
Sen. Stacey Donato’s Senate Enrolled Act 482 specifically seeks to beef up the state’s absenteeism statute.
The measure has multiple parts, including a new definition in state code for chronically absent, specified in the bill as missing 10% or more of the school year, regardless of whether it is excused. Another provision allows local prosecuting attorneys to hold “intervention meetings” with parents to help improve a student’s attendance before any legal action is taken. 
A final section of the bill prohibits K-8 students from expulsion “solely because the student is chronically absent or habitually truant. Current law permits students in those grades to be expelled for missing too much school.
Indiana officials say chronic absenteeism rates are improving, but there’s still more work ahead

In the final days of the session, however, a conference committee added language to sunset the expulsion prohibition on July 1, 2026. After that date, students could be removed from school once again if they miss too many days of class.
The latest attendance numbers released by the Indiana Department of Education last fall reported that 17.8% of K-12 students — roughly 219,00 kids — were “chronically absent” during the most recent 2023-24 school year, meaning they missed at least 18 days.
There was less consensus on a different bill to bring back a statewide letter grade system for Indiana’s K-12 schools. It was sent straight to Braun after a quick 65-25 House vote. 
Earlier this week, lawmakers appeared to disagree on a final draft of House Enrolled Act 1498. Any serious conflicts were quashed behind closed doors; Rep. Bob Behning, R-Indianapolis, called his measure for a final concurrence vote in the House Thursday evening, signaling a truce with the opposing Senate chamber.
Behning said his bill seeks to put the state education board’s recently unveiled accountability draft — or something like it — into action.
In its final form, the legislation will strip back much of the previous accountability framework and task Indiana’s State Board of Education (SBOE) with building a new A-F rule — that looks beyond just academic performance and graduation rates — by the end of 2025.
Once approved by the governor, a new round of grades will be assigned to Hoosier schools around the start of the 2026-27 academic year.
Although the state board is responsible for hammering out the particulars, the bill does require the new grading system’s methodology to be based on data from the state education department’s existing GPS dashboard and proficiency rates from state assessments, including the IREAD. It also has to prioritize students earning new diploma seals recently approved by the state board.










Yes, we certainly should hold people accountable. We should hold school leaders accountable. We should hold our children accountable. We should hold our parents accountable. But I don't think we should give them a label of an F (to show) that you’re failing.


– Rep. Vernon Smith, D-Gary


School grades have been effectively suspended since 2018, when Indiana shifted from ISTEP to a new state standardized test and later grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic.
House Democrats “still had a problem” with the final draft, said Rep. Vernon Smith, D-Gary.
“We do feel like we need to look at our school accountability process, but we don’t feel like we need to hold the Department of Education accountable for using the model of A through F,” he said.
“Yes, we certainly should hold people accountable. We should hold school leaders accountable. We should hold our children accountable. We should hold our parents accountable. But I don’t think we should give them a label of an F (to show) that you’re failing,” Smith continued, saying he preferred an earlier idea to give schools a “need for improvement” designation, rather than a “bad” letter grade. “I just don’t think that we need to do this.”
Crackdowns on energy moratoriums, lab-grown meat and marijuana advertising
A bid to boost Indiana’s electricity supply — by side-stepping often-hostile local zoning authorities — squeaked through to the governor despite opposition from advocates of local control and renewable energy.
A negotiated compromise for Senate Enrolled Act 425 just barely earned the constitutionally required majority of supportive votes during a 51-40 vote in the House. It enjoyed stronger margins in the Senate, with a 31-19 tally.
Under the legislation, the owner of a proposed power plant wouldn’t have to seek any local zoning approval in certain circumstances. But the Senate explicitly excluded solar and wind installations.
Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, said it’s ironic that a small modular nuclear reactor — “which uses radioactive fuel and will generate radioactive waste” — would encounter less local scrutiny than solar panels and wind turbines.
“It’s not consistent with the rhetoric that we hear on this floor all the time about how we are an ‘all the above’ energy state,” Pierce added.

The measure’s House sponsor, Rep. Ed Soliday, has maintained the Senate wouldn’t allow it.
“There was just no hope of putting it back in,” he said Wednesday. “… We went back to them several times and they said ‘no.’”
The eased requirements apply if a project is located on land that already hosts an electric generation facility — even it’s not operational — or a former mine. State regulators would also have to either grant a certificate of public convenience and necessity for construction or decline jurisdiction.
Senate Enrolled Act 425 also aims to stop “abuse” of moratoriums on electric generation projects by local authorities. It caps them to one year and prohibits renewals.
“I’ve seen how moratoriums can be abused,” Rep. Kendell Culp, R-Rensselaer, said Monday.
He argued the “real purpose” of moratorium is to create a “pause” while a local government hurries to adopt an ordinance. But some keep moving the “goal posts.”
“If there’s a certain type of development your jurisdiction does not want, then just say ‘no’ upfront and save all the headache,” Culp said.
Additionally, lab-cultivated meat could soon be banned from production or sale in Indiana for two years with violators to face $10,000 per-day fines.

That’s if Braun approves of House Enrolled Act 1425, which is coming his way after final votes of 74-15 in the House and 43-7.
But a state study of the products’ safety was shelved as lawmakers look to cut spending.
“We were supposed to have a study, I guess to determine what we would do after the moratorium, and apparently the fiscal people said we’re broke, so take the study out,” Pierce said. “So it makes me wonder what we’re going to actually be learning in the next two years.”
The Senate introduced the study and a one-year moratorium following pronounced confusion in that chamber’s committee. In addition to cutting the study, the final version of the legislation extends the moratorium to two years.
In another governor-bound proposal, those advertising marijuana within state lines could face fines of up to $15,000 apiece under a once-inconspicuous agency bill.
Also in the co-opted House Enrolled Act 1390 — originally focused on the Bureau of Motor Vehicles — are contentious regulations for towing and overgrown rural intersections.
The advertising ban would also apply to the rest of Indiana’s Schedule I list of controlled substances. Contracts locked down before the measure’s passage would be exempt. Hoosiers who live around the edges of the state have seen billboards and other advertising pop up because adjoining states have legalized marijuana.
Other provisions would set standards for how law enforcement agencies handle their towing contractors, how much companies can charge for emergency towing, how owners can recover their towed vehicles and more.

Both concepts landed in the final bill draft after being stripped out three weeks ago. In between, they were added to a bill about the sale of utility trailers and then removed.
Lawmakers also folded in a weaker take on a tragedy-sparked push for better sightlines at overgrown, uncontrolled rural intersections. Counties would be able to mow or maintain vegetation in state- or county-owned right-of-way with permission from the Indiana Department of Transportation. The onus was previously on landowners.
The legislation retained plenty of Bureau of Motor Vehicles changes, too.
It would allow the agency to issue electronic registration certificates, requires that toll road operators invoice drivers within a year, caps the amount private driving skills trainers can charge for exams, and more. One other provision allows for real-time electronic insurance verification after accidents. The current system is unwieldy and often results in license suspensions.
It eased through the House in an 81-9 vote, but encountered greater opposition in the Senate’s 31-19 vote.
 Negotiated Senate measures focus on PBMs, ‘squatters’


Large numbers of Hoosiers will now be carved out of a bill regulating pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. Senate Enrolled Act 140 will require insurers and PBMs ensure network adequacy and restricts anticompetitive practices — but Medicaid, managed care organizations and the state employee health plan are all exempt due to concerns about cost increases.
Instead, the issue of contracting under Medicaid and the state employee health plan is punted to an interim study committee — though at least one sponsor said it was “kind of up to debate” whether or not there would be an added cost.

“We don’t have a fully transparent model. So the fact that there could be a fiscal on it — and with this current budget situation — that’s what’s putting the pause on it,” said Rep. Julie McGuire, R-Indianapolis, before a Thursday committee.
A bill seeking to define a “squatter” encountered several hurdles this session, too, with critics concerned about whether vague language would unintentionally harm tenants with informal or unwritten rental agreements.
Under the finalized Senate Enrolled Act 157, law enforcement officers can remove an individual on a property without the permission of the owner within 48 hours, unless there is “credible evidence that the person is not a squatter.”
It would also penalize someone who tries to evict someone who might have a right to the property.
“We don’t want an unscrupulous landlord to be able to use the wrong date or something very simple like that as a means to abuse this part of the code,” said Rep. Joanna King from the floor.
Still, the changes weren’t enough for a handful of lawmakers. Pierce, a Democrat who voted no, previously indicated his doubts that such a law was necessary.
However, it got a unanimous nod in the Senate — its originating chamber — and now goes to the governor.
What’s next for 13th checks, broadband?

Indiana’s public sector retirees are set to get a coveted bonus by October under legislation on its way to Braun — but with a 5% discount.
The thousands of former state and local employees who live off pension benefits that don’t keep up with inflation would’ve gotten nothing after Senate edits. But they would’ve won several years worth of full-amount bonuses through the original version of House Enrolled Act 1221.
“The 5% cut, it’s not what we wanted. One year is not what we wanted. But, we live to … advocate for another day,” said Rep. Greg Porter, D-Indianapolis.
“This is the spot we landed on to preserve something,” Rep. Mike Karickhoff, R-Kokomo, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle after the 90-0 vote. He authored the legislation.

The 13th check would range from $143 to $428, based on years of service for former teachers; excise, conservation and gaming officers; and most other retirees. That’s instead of the typical $150 to $450 range. Former Indiana State Police employees would get checks for 0.95% — instead of 1% — of their maximum annual pension amounts.
The bonuses would cost about $31.8 million, with the 5% cut saving about $1.7 million. That’s according to an earlier fiscal analysis, which estimated the full-amount bonuses would’ve totaled $33.5 million in the 2026 fiscal year.
Others were dissatisfied, arguing that a dismal revenue forecast shouldn’t affect the checks. They’re paid out of supplemental reserve accounts — featuring money from retirees themselves and employer matches — not the General Fund.
Pierce accused the Senate of “insisting” on the cut to “send a message” of fiscal responsibility. He called it a “kick in the teeth.”
In the Senate, however, the 39-11 vote featured opposition exclusively from worried Republicans.
“The math is not math-ing,” said Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis.
Under one of the final bills approved this session, a whopping $870 million in federal incentives could be on the way to help Indiana connect its last 150,000 Hoosiers to high-speed internet. That’s if the state’s own service providers don’t get in the way, though.
‘Number-one obstructionist’: Electricity co-ops lambasted for slow broadband rollout

Lawmakers’ attempt to mediate utility pole attachment disputes between electric utilities and telecommunications companies crossed the legislative finish line Thursday night, after languishing on the Senate’s calendar for four days.
“Obviously, I passed on this bill a lot of times,” Sen. Andy Zay, R-Huntington, told his colleagues. “I had a lot of consternation whether … it was time for this.”
Senate Enrolled Act 502 would give both sides a 60-day deadline to meet after a government broadband grant contract is executed. They’d have four months to reach a project management agreement after the National Telecommunications Information Administration approves the Indiana Broadband Office’s proposal for spending the federal Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) money.
It also sets detailed deadlines for cooperation if they can’t concur. And the office could set up a “rapid response mediation process” when disputes arise — pulling back from the hefty fines previously considered.
That’s the compromise lawmakers reached in the House after several rounds of edits. Zay filed a motion to concur with that chamber’s changes, but waited to call it for a vote.
“I wasn’t certain whether to bring it forward this year or wait until next year when we’re in the throes of the BEAD program,” he confessed.
Ultimately, he decided that having “this process in place will be a great start as implementation hopefully begins later this year,” adding that lawmakers could simply adjust it next year if needed.
Zay’s proposal sailed through the Senate on a concurrence for of 47-2. It heads to Braun for final approval.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)A federal judge in Maryland temporarily blocked the U.S. Department of Education’s attempt to end diversity, equity and inclusion practices in schools by threatening to withhold federal funding from schools that refuse to comply.
U.S. District of Judge Stephanie Gallagher wrote Thursday that the court isn’t required to assess whether policies from the department “are good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair.”
But the court “is constitutionally required to closely scrutinize whether the government went about creating and implementing them in the manner the law requires. The government did not,” the judge wrote.
“The Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) claim, have demonstrated that they will be irreparably harmed absent preliminary relief, and have shown the equities and public interest favor them,” she wrote in a 48-page ruling.
While Gallagher focused on the process behind the policy, another federal judge blocked the attempted DEI ban based on the effects the policy would have if it was allowed to take effect.
U.S. District Judge Landya McCafferty, in New Hampshire said in her 82-page ruling Thursday that a preliminary injunction was proper because the plaintiffs had shown they were likely to win on their claims that the policy is unconstitutionally vague, that it infringed on teachers’ First Amendment rights, that it would cause actual harm and that it overstepped the federal agency’s authority, among other claims.

And yet another judge, U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich in the District of Columbia, ruled from the bench Thursday that the government could not enforce its demand that schools certify by April 24 that they were in compliance with the anti-DEI rule because the policy was so vague that schools could not know if they were in compliance or not. Threatening the loss of federal funding “without sufficiently defining the conduct that might trigger liability, violates the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition on vagueness,” Friedrich said in a brief 16-page ruling.
The rulings by Friedrich and Gallagher — both of whom were appointed by President Donald Trump (R) in his first term — are effective nationwide. The preliminary injunction by McCafferty, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama (D), is nationwide as well, but only in effect at schools where plaintiffs in her case — the National Education Association, its New Hampshire chapter, and the Center for Black Educator Development — are represented.
Since being sworn in to his second term in January, Trump has pushed for the elimination of diversity, equity and inclusion programs and policies in federal agencies, colleges and universities and K-12 schools.
The lawsuits stem from a Feb. 14 “Dear Colleague letter” from the Education Department to schools across the country that reminded K-12 schools, colleges and universities that if they do not comply with civil rights law “face potential loss of federal funding.”
But the letter, and supporting documentation, went on to declare that DEI programs violate the law as just another form of racial discrimination, using terms like “pervasive and repugnant,” “toxic,” and “insidious” instruction that use “crude racial stereotypes” to divide students.
That was followed by an April 3 letter to state education agencies given 10 days — later extended to April 24 — to certify their compliance with federal DEI ban in order to continue receiving federal assistance.
The letter was quickly challenged. In addition to the New Hampshire plaintiffs, the NAACP filed suit in Washington, D.C., and the American Federation of Teachers, its Maryland chapter and the American Sociological Association – later joined by a school district in Eugene, Oregon — sued in Maryland.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A spokesperson for the Department of Education did not respond to emails Thursday seeking comment on the multiple court rulings. But education advocates were elated.
“Today’s decision from the court affirms what we already know – the Trump administration is unlawfully threatening educators who meet the diverse needs of every student and undermining our public education system,” AFT Maryland President Kenya Campbell said in a statement. “This preliminary injunction pauses the chaos caused by targeting and attacking vital communities and temporarily protects the critical funding schools, from our K-12 schools to our higher education institutions, rely on.”
Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP, said in a statement that, “Our fight is far from over, but today’s decision is a victory for Black and Brown students across the country, whose right to an equal education has been directly threatened by this Administration’s corrosive actions and misinterpretations of civil rights law.”
“We look forward to prevailing against their cruel attempts to undermine the mission of the U.S. Department of Education and relegate children of color, students with disabilities, and poor students to a second-class education in a throwback to the era before Brown v. Board of Education,” he said of the 1954 Supreme Court ruling the ended the “separate but equal” doctrine that allowed for segregated schools.
‘Reaffirming its commitment’
While the court challenges were pending, Maryland school officials were working on their own response to the DEI certification letter that had been due to federal officials by Thursday.
According to a letter from State Superintendent Carey Wright, the state will continue to affirm its commitment to upholding civil rights laws. In doing that, all 24 school system superintendents signed a certification of compliance letter that was sent via email to the federal department’s Office of Civil Rights.
House rejects GOP amendments, gives final approval to bill creating Reparations Commission

Wright also mentions the New Hampshire case, in which the plaintiffs had reached a short-term agreement with the department to delay implementation of the certification, which was extended Thursday by McCafferty’s ruling.
“While MSDE [Maryland State Department of Education] is unaware of any legal authority obligating it to comply with USDE’s request, MSDE is reaffirming its commitment to complying with Title VI and other relevant federal laws,” Wright wrote.
Wright and state Board of Education President Joshua Michael issued a joint statement in a video for stakeholders.
“Above all, our charge remains to ensure that all students have equal access to a high-quality education — all students, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, neighborhood, disability, socioeconomic status, or the language spoken at home, Michael said. “Not only is this our moral calling, but Maryland law gives us this charge.”
As for the case in Maryland, Gallagher did reject the plaintiffs’ request to require that the Trump administration restore DEI and civil rights guidance from previous administrations on its website. She also ruled the current department can maintain an online portal titled “End DEI,” through which community members can report instances of discrimination.
“The government is entitled to express its viewpoint on its website and to maintain a reporting portal for Title VI and Equal Protection concerns, so long as it does not actually pursue enforcement actions that are not in accordance with existing law,” the judge wrote.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pb250082_0-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-25 00:02:35.029750

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Dissatisfaction with the “status quo” is driving Jon Hansen and Karla Lems to run for South Dakota governor and lieutenant governor, they said.
The pair officially announced their 2026 campaign to hundreds of supporters Thursday at the South Dakota Military Heritage Alliance in Sioux Falls. The crowd included property rights advocates against eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines, “election integrity” activists and over a dozen Republican lawmakers.
Hansen, who currently serves as state House speaker, will seek the Republican Party’s nomination for governor, with Lems, his second in command in the House, running to serve as his lieutenant governor.
The two, along with speakers who introduced them, said elected officials too often put the “people’s interests” second to special interests. To resounding applause, they said that’s caused a wave of opposition to establishment politicians, a referred state pipeline law that voters rejected in November, and ousted incumbent state lawmakers in last June’s primary election.
“Grassroots patriots from all across the great state of South Dakota are standing up and we are saying in record numbers, ‘No more corruption, no more waste and abuse, no more tax on our land and our liberties and our way of life,’” Hansen said to the crowd. “Today renews the coming of the end for all of that.”

If elected, Hansen pledged to “clean up” the system by cutting state government and spending. He also promised to create “education choice grants” for alternative and private school education, and sign an executive order to “define man and woman, end the woke and restore common sense.” Hansen said he plans to stop offering “corporate welfare” as well.
Republican governors and lawmakers for decades have invested millions of tax dollars in bonds, loans and grants to entice businesses to build and expand in the state. That includes funding for farmers and value-added operations, as well as support for larger investments such as Tru Shrimp.
Hansen cited the Tru Shrimp deal as an example of “corporate welfare.”
State and local officials committed $6.5 million in taxpayer money for a low-interest loan six years ago for Tru Shrimp to build a facility in Madison. The company has not built the facility, even though it was expected to break ground in 2024. The company, which has since changed its name to Iterro, announced it’s “more than halfway” to its fundraising goal to begin the Madison project earlier this year.
“I think it’s just unnecessary government mingling, and it’s risky business, and they’re wasting our taxpayer dollars to do it,” Hansen said of the deal. “It’s that sort of stuff that we want to say ‘no more’ to. Let’s just get back to the free market, low tax and low regulation.”
A Dell Rapids lawyer, Hansen has spent a decade in the South Dakota House of Representatives. The 39-year-old was elected House speaker for the most recent legislative session after serving as speaker pro tempore from 2021 to 2022.
Lems, from Canton, owns a coffee shop and property management business. The 56-year-old entered the state political fray in 2022 and was elected as House speaker pro tempore during the most recent legislative session, the first woman to hold the position in state history.
The two are riding the momentum of private property rights and anti-abortion successes in the last year.

Both have been leading forces on property rights in the Legislature, culminating in an eminent domain ban for carbon capture pipelines signed into law this year. The legislation contributed to the Public Utilities Commission’s recent denial of Summit Carbon Solutions’ second permit application to build a portion of its $9 billion pipeline through the state.
Hansen would sometimes be introduced as “our governor” during rallies in opposition to Summit’s pipeline. He told attendees at the event Thursday that under his leadership, the “only thing that’s going to get sequestered are leftist climate policies” — a reference to Summit’s planned underground “sequestration” of carbon dioxide in North Dakota. Meanwhile, Republican President Donald Trump championed carbon capture and storage this week, highlighting it as part of his agenda to improve American energy production.
When asked about Trump’s support of carbon sequestration, Hansen said “when it comes to taking people’s land and using it without their consent in order to build a risky pipeline across their property, that’s a big no.”

Hansen has also focused on anti-abortion legislation and tightening South Dakota’s election laws in the Legislature. Now vice president of South Dakota Right to Life and co-chair of the Life Defense Fund, he organized a campaign last year that fended off a ballot initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.
Hansen and Lems are the first to announce their candidacy for the governor’s race, though other prominent South Dakota politicians have said they’re considering their own bids, including Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden and Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson. Other Republicans frequently mentioned as possible candidates include Attorney General Marty Jackley, who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2018, and Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, who briefly considered a run against Johnson for U.S. House last year.
Rhoden, who formerly served as lieutenant governor, changed the name of his campaign fundraising committee to “Rhoden for Governor” in February. His lieutenant governor, Tony Venhuizen, created a new campaign fundraising committee the same month.
The Legislature changed the process for choosing lieutenant governor nominees this year. The new law allows candidates for governor to choose their running mate, rather than relying on political party conventions to nominate them.
If more than one person from each party seeks the nomination, party voters will choose their nominee for governor in the primary election on June 2, 2026. The winners will advance to the general election on Nov. 3, 2026.
Rhoden is currently serving the remainder of the second term won by former Gov. Kristi Noem, who would’ve been term-limited at the end of 2026. She resigned earlier this year to accept the top job at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

In a statement, the U.S. Army said that Col. Sheyla Baez Ramirez had been suspended as garrison commander at Fort McCoy. 
The statement said that the suspension “is not related to any misconduct,” though the base drew recent criticism for not displaying pictures of Trump and Hegseth, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. On X, formerly known as Twitter, the Department of Defense posted a picture showing Trump’s portrait missing from  a leadership wall and Hegseth’s turned so only the back of the picture was visible. The post declared: “Regarding the Ft. McCoy Chain of Command wall controversy…. WE FIXED IT! Also, an investigation has begun to figure out exactly what happened.”
Spokespeople from the Department of Defense and Fort McCoy’s 88th Readiness Division declined to comment, but told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Ramirez has “not been relieved of command.” A subsequent statement on the U.S. Army’s website said that neither Ramirez nor anyone else on the fort’s leadership team had directed the removal of the portraits. After Ramirez was suspended, Hegseth shared a post on X mentioning the commander’s suspension.

It appears to be a case of differing interpretations of state law regarding the hiring process, and clearly represents a new interpretation of the law from the governor’s office.
Allen Simpson of Lincoln, a long-time PERB member who had headed the board’s personnel committee, told the Examiner that the committee recently recommended the hiring of the current interim director/deputy director of the agency, Tyler Cummings. He would have filled the vacancy left when the past director, former State Treasurer and State Sen. John Murante, resigned in December.
Same process followed
Simpson said the PERB search committee followed the same process as it had in hiring the previous three directors — do a search, and then let the governor approve it.
“They’re not going to get a better candidate than Tyler Cummings,” Simpson added.
He said he resigned from the board on Monday feeling that if the governor did not agree with his committee’s pick, “you probably shouldn’t stay on.”
“I’m trying to say this in the most politically correct way possible,” said Simpson, who, like Pillen, is a Republican.
However, later Thursday, Pillen’s spokeswoman, Laura Strimple, emailed that the governor hadn’t rejected anyone.
Former Nebraska lawmaker expresses concern about major changes to school retirement plan 

Strimple said that state law requires PERB to “work with the Governor” in selecting a director and that the Governor shall approve the applicant before the appointment proceeds to the Legislature.
The state law cited by Strimple clearly states that it is the responsibility of the PERB Board “to appoint a director to administer the systems under the direction of the board. The appointment shall be subject to the approval of the Governor and a majority of the Legislature.”
An Examiner reporter could not find a clause in the chapter of state law, 84-1503, cited that mentions “working with” the governor to select a director. And Strimple was not immediately available Thursday evening to clarify.
Surfaced in legislative debate 
In her earlier statement, Strimple said that “Gov. Pillen looks forward to working with the Board to identify a highly experienced leader for NPERS.”
She said that applications for the job, which had paid $205,000-a-year, are now due by May 22.
When asked about the differing interpretations of law, Simpson said that while he’s not an attorney, “I can read a statute as well as anyone else.” The personnel committee, he said, used the same process as it had in three previous selection processes, and the governor had approved all three.
Simpson added that he hoped that Cummings would still be considered to become director because he is highly qualified and has the respect of the retirement system staff.
The issue of the reopened search for a PERB director was raised during debate in the State Legislature over a bill making major changes to the state teachers retirement plan.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A bill that would mandate the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services to screen state wards for Social Security benefit eligibility advanced Thursday to the second round of debate in the Legislature. 
Legislative Bill 275, which State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha named her priority legislation, moved forward on a 34-0 vote.
DHHS currently intercepts the Social Security benefits belonging to children in foster care and uses those funds to offset the costs of the youths’ care, according to Hunt’s statement of intent. Her bill would “bring Nebraska in line with federal law to provide further accountability, transparency, and conservation of a portion of the funds in a trust account for the youth’s own use when they exit state care.”
There was little to no debate surrounding the bill Thursday, except for some questioning of its financial impact on the state’s general funds by two Republican lawmakers. 
Hunt insisted that her amended bill would impact the state budget less than her original proposal, but that it would still give kids in foster care access to more of their Social Security money than they have today.

Dunleavy's veto of House Bill 69, to increase school funding, on April 22, 2024 (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)On April 22, 2025, the Alaska Legislature had the opportunity and responsibility to secure stable and meaningful investment in our children’s education. With the override vote on House Bill 69, lawmakers were given a chance to rise above political posturing and provide the first real increase to the base student allocation, or BSA, in nearly a decade. They failed. Seven no votes. That’s all it took to deny our public schools the $1,000 per-student increase so many have been fighting for, not for political gain, but for survival. Our students, educators and families are not abstract line items in a budget. We are not “special interests.” We are the very people who hold up the future of this state. And yet, 27 elected officials chose to turn their backs on us. Their “No” votes were loud and clear: They do not believe our children, especially those in underfunded, rural, and urban schools deserve a fully resourced, safe, and equitable education. They chose the governor’s austerity politics over our students’ needs. They chose silence in classrooms over music. Larger class sizes over individualized attention. Closures over community.
Let’s be honest: This was never just about numbers. This was about priorities. Those who voted against the override would like us to believe Alaska can’t afford to fund its public education system. But for the last seven years, they found money for everything but schools for tax credits, bloated bureaucracies, private interests and the Permanent Fund Dividend, which somehow remains sacred while our kids go without updated textbooks, working heat or school counselors. Meanwhile, school districts across the state now brace for catastrophic consequences. Layoffs. School closures. Slashed programs. And most devastatingly, students losing opportunities they may never get back. As a mother of five, a teacher, and the Alaska education chair for the NAACP Tri State Area Conference, I am furious. But I am not surprised. We’ve seen this coming. We’ve been warning them. We’ve testified, rallied and begged. This veto was a betrayal. The failure to override it was a choice. Let me be clear: This is not over.
And to be clear this doesn’t just impact students and teachers. It affects all of us. When schools suffer, communities suffer. When education is unstable, workforce readiness declines, mental health needs go unmet, and family stress skyrockets. Local businesses lose future workers. Property values drop. Crime and disengagement increase. These outcomes do not stay confined to the walls of a school they ripple through every neighborhood, every economy, every generation. Well-funded public education is a public good. It is the bedrock of a strong democracy, a healthy economy, and a just society. Undermining it undermines us all. To those who stood with us the 33 House and Senate members who voted to override we see you. We thank you. And to the others: we’ll be seeing you, too. Because this is not just about a failed vote. It’s about a fight for the soul of public education in Alaska and we are not backing down.

[…[...]","The Missoula County Court House pictured on December 20, 2020.Missoula County District Court Judge Jason Marks peppered questions at a lawyer for the State of Montana in a hearing Thursday about whether a bill that bans gender-affirming care for minors is constitutional.
In 2023, the Montana Legislature adopted, and Gov. Greg Gianforte signed, Senate Bill 99, which banned gender-affirming care for minors in Montana. The bill also opened up providers to punishment and civil actions.
A coalition of minors and providers sued the state, and in December 2024, the Montana Supreme Court found the District Court in Missoula was correct in temporarily blocking the law based on privacy rights in the state Constitution.
Thursday, Marks heard arguments for summary judgment, or a decision without a trial based on the facts already presented.
ACLU of Montana lawyer Alex Rate argued the case, Cross et al v. State of Montana, is parallel to abortion lawsuits in which courts have granted summary judgment based on the state’s constitutional right to privacy.
Those abortion cases have been unanimously upheld by the Montana Supreme Court.
In a separate case regarding an executive order, Rate said, “the federal court there said, quote, the evidence supporting gender affirming care for adolescents is as robust as the evidence supporting other pediatric treatments.”
However, Michael Noonan and Thane Johnson for the State of Montana said a trial is warranted.
Noonan said the parties disagree on many material facts, such as the harms of gender-affirming care, and experts are offering differing opinions that need to be sorted out.
“A trial is the appropriate time to evaluate the merits of the competing evidence presented in this case,” Noonan said.
State argues it’s protecting minors
In his argument, Noonan said the state Constitution gives the state the power to protect minors in Article 2 Section 15, and SB 99 “clearly enhances the protection of minors.”
He said care can leave people infertile or irreversibly physically damaged, it isn’t proven to reduce the risk of suicide, and some countries in Europe, which had been the “vanguard” of such treatments, have since reversed course.
Meanwhile, Noonan said, some people in the U.S. end up rushed into gender-affirming care, without an adequate or even any psychological evaluation.
When the government has a “compelling interest,” such as protecting a minor, it can enforce a law designed to be narrow enough to address that interest.
In one of many questions for Noonan, Marks said he wanted to know why the law bans the treatment altogether.
Instead, Marks said, it could have required extra evaluations before allowing a patient to grant “informed consent,” a voluntary decision to receive a medical intervention with knowledge of its risks and benefits.
“I don’t see this as narrowly tailored to the problem you’re addressing. Can you help me with that?” Marks said.
Marks also said the idea that people under 18 can’t give informed consent doesn’t seem to be supported by Montana law.
Noonan said Montana’s approach in SB 99 aligns with Europe’s approach, which starts with psychotherapy, but doesn’t rush into gender-affirming care.
He said in the U.S. minors are being hurried into treatments that might be unnecessary, and they don’t get the “full scope” of what might alleviate their gender dysphoria, the condition of feeling like one’s gender is out of alignment with one’s sex at birth.
But Marks said under the law, even minors who had gone through an extensive evaluation and continued to experience gender dysphoria would not be able to receive gender-affirming care.
“Doesn’t that seem problematic?” Marks said.
The judge also said Montana offers a higher degree of privacy protection than other states.
Additionally, Marks said he struggled with the idea that the legislature could ban a certain treatment because the possibility of a negative outcome, a conclusion he saw in the state’s argument.
For example: What about a concern stemming from a debunked claim that measles vaccines cause problems?
Noonan argued the parallel didn’t apply: “There was one study that’s been clearly debunked, and the medical consensus, at least I would say globally, is that vaccines are fine. We don’t have the same facts here.”
Marks, though, said he wrestled with the idea the state had a legitimate position in its blanket ban on gender-affirming care when minors already can give consent to treatments that can result in other serious harms or even death, such as surgery to remove a brain tumor.
“Under Montana law, this is literally the only treatment that a child cannot give informed consent to,” Marks said. “ … Why do you think that’s a defensible position?”
Noonan said adolescents don’t always choose wisely, it’s not a lifelong ban, and the decisions are heavy and consequential, such as infertility.
“Can they even weigh what that means in the future, and will that matter to them?” Noonan said.
Plaintiffs show framework for summary judgment
Rate said the state offered claims about gender-affirming care from “experts who don’t treat gender dysphoria” and witnesses who don’t have any connection to Montana.
He said it had to look to Europe for its arguments, although no country offers a ban as “draconian” as Montana’s, and the two that the state identified are in the United Kingdom, which he said allows hormones at 16.
He said the “true justification for Senate Bill 99” is “animus, plain and simple.”
Rate, for the ACLU of Montana, said the case is actually simple and straightforward.
Rate said the cases that offer the legal framework are abortion cases in Montana, which have been decided on summary judgment without trial “almost without exception.”
The plaintiffs are Phoebe Cross, a transgender minor, and parents Molly and Paul Cross; a couple of medical providers Juanita Hodax and Katherine Mistretta, on behalf of themselves and their patients; and a John Doe and Jane Doe.
Their legal team also includes ACLU’s National LGBT & HIV Project, Lambda Legal, and Perkins Coie.
As for the legal framework, Rate said the right to privacy for abortion is parallel in this case for gender-affirming care, and privacy is protected in the Montana Constitution.
“Health care decisions should be made between an individual and their health care providers, not by the legislature, not by the executive, not by the courts,” Rate said.
He said the state had argued that abortion comes with great risk of complications, and the state had a right to protect its citizens.
But Rate said in Weems et al. vs. State of Montana and other cases, the court found the state could not show the laws were narrowly tailored to address the concern.
He also pointed to rulings in Planned Parenthood vs. the state of Montana and Armstrong vs. the State of Montana.
Additionally, he said, the state’s argument about a high health risk didn’t hold up when compared to abortion.
In another parallel case, he said the court found a medical protocol — endorsed by major medical organizations — was prohibited for abortion care, but the identical protocol was allowed for miscarriages.
But in that case, the court found there can’t be “a bona fide health risk” if the protocols are the same, he said. Rather, Rate said, “the state made a values judgment that it doesn’t like abortion.”
In fact, he said, in another case about parental consent, the state argued a minor was not mature enough to decide to get an abortion, but the court struck down that law as well, finding the state’s interest wasn’t compelling, or narrowly tailored.
The state argued some people regret gender-affirming care, and Rate said some people periodically regret abortion too, but that doesn’t justify making it illegal.
Even if the judge accepted the state’s “overly inflated” data point that 30% of people who experience such care regret it — “which we vigorously dispute” — he said it would still mean 70% don’t regret it, but would be banned from receiving it.
Even in the Cross case, he said, the court has provided a clear roadmap to strike down SB 99 as unconstitutional.
Rate also shared the results of gender-affirming care for one of the team’s clients.
“Our client Phoebe Cross has flourished as a result of receiving gender affirming care,” Rate said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201220_mslabuildings_tm_024-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 23:01:45.583261

Under the version House and Senate Democrats announced late Thursday, annual rent hikes statewide would be capped at 7% plus inflation, or 10%, whichever is lower in a given year. The latest bill would also nix a proposed carveout for some single-family homes and shorten the time that new construction would be exempt from the cap.
The news provides a potential middle-ground resolution for a bill that is a top priority for progressives and a policy idea that failed to win approval in Olympia last year. 
Rep. Nicole Macri, D-Seattle, said Thursday that “I know that there will be many tenants around the state who will have wished for a stronger policy, but this bill brings important protections.”
Lawmakers once appeared set to push through a 7% cap despite staunch opposition from Republicans, some moderate Democrats and many landlords. 
But the Senate thwarted that plan this month when lawmakers raised the limit to 10% plus inflation in a surprising move that squeaked through by a single vote. The Democratic senator who proposed the change said at the time that a 7% cap “is dangerous.”
Republicans and a smattering of Democrats also moved successfully in the Senate to exempt single-family home rentals not owned by a real estate development trust or company, carving out a sizable chunk of landlords from the potential cap.
Advocates argued the Senate’s changes “gutted” the legislation.
The compromise measure removes the single-family home exemption.
Through the process, lawmakers had also moved to exempt new buildings from the cap for their first 15 years. Negotiators dropped that period down to 12 years in the new plan.
The legislation would still expire after 15 years, as the Senate had proposed.
The House and Senate could vote on the new version of House Bill 1217 as soon as Friday evening. The legislative session is slated to end Sunday.
If both chambers pass the bill and the governor signs it, the policy would go into effect immediately.
Democrats last year pushed for such a cap on rent increases, only to have moderate members of their own party and Republicans block progress. They believe a known limit on increases would provide stability to renters who could be forced out of their homes by steep rent hikes.
“I think this is life-changing legislation for a lot of families across Washington state,” said House Housing Committee Chair Strom Peterson, D-Edmonds.
Republicans have argued the cap would force builders out of the state and put landlords in a bind as they struggle to keep up with inflationary maintenance costs and property taxes.
On Thursday, conservative lawmakers expressed frustration about being shut out of the negotiating process, and continued to decry the proposal.
“I do believe that the policy that’s before me tonight is going to be devastating for our housing providers, and we need housing providers to be a part of the solution in the housing crisis that we have,” said Rep. Sam Low, R-Lake Stevens.
Through all the debates on what is, perhaps, the most contentious policy bill of the legislative session, Gov. Bob Ferguson has remained mum on his feelings about it.
The negotiated bill otherwise contains many of the provisions included in earlier iterations.
For example, landlords also could not raise rent by any amount in the first 12 months of a tenancy. If landlords violate the new law, tenants or the state attorney general’s office could bring litigation.
Buildings owned by nonprofits or public housing authorities would be exempt from the limits. The same goes for duplexes, triplexes or fourplexes if the owner lives in one of the units.
The legislation also looks to cap rent increases at 5% per year for manufactured home tenants.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apartments-tacoma-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 23:01:45.583261

(Photo by Lisa Phu/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Department of Corrections has reported three in-custody deaths in the month of April so far, bringing the total reported this year to five in-custody deaths. 
Nathaniel David Leask, 49, died on April 3 in the Anchorage Correctional Complex. He was remanded just six days prior, for “multiple probation violations” according to the department.
The ACLU of Alaska first reported that Leask died by suicide, and said according to witnesses that he lay for more than three hours before correctional staff began attempting life-saving measures. It was the second in-custody suicide this year. The civil rights group has called for more resources for mental health care, and greater oversight and accountability from the Department of Corrections in protocols surrounding in-custody deaths, and preventing more deaths. 
The Alaska Department of Public Safety confirmed Leask’s death was a suicide on Thursday, through department spokesperson Austin McDaniel. 
“Troopers were notified at 8:40 pm on April 3 that 49-year-old Ketchikan resident Nathaniel Leask had died at Anchorage Correctional Center inside of a general housing cell. An investigation conducted by the Alaska State Troopers determined that Leask’s injuries were self-inflicted. Next of kin have been notified, and his body was sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office,” he said in an email statement. 
Alaska state troopers conduct investigations into all in-custody deaths, “just as we would for any other unanticipated death that occurs in Alaska,” McDaniel said. “Our primary duty is to determine if any criminal conduct contributed to the decedent’s death.”
Also in April, two people died in-custody that McDaniel said were “medically expected deaths.”
Marcias Zorita Reinhold, 83, died in Hiland Mountain Correctional Center in Eagle River on April 8. She had been incarcerated since 1998, according to the department.
Lena Lola Lynn, 63, died in Goose Creek Correctional Center in Wasilla on Sunday, April 20. She was remanded on June 21, 2024, for “parole violations related to prior convictions,” the department said.
DOC has reported five in-custody deaths so far this year. 
Pedro George Rubke, 78, died on Feb. 4, in Goose Creek Correctional Center. He had been incarcerated since 2012. 
Reginald Eugene Childers Jr., 42, died on March 3 at the Anchorage Correctional Complex. He was remanded on January 3, and was incarcerated pretrial. According to the State Troopers, he was found unresponsive in a cell and transported to a hospital where he later died. The death was deemed a suicide. 
The recent deaths bring the tally to at least 70 deaths in custody of DOC jails and prisons since 2020, with at least 18 deaths reported as suicides, according to the department. 
DOC declined to comment on the recent death incidents on Thursday. Betsy Holley, a department spokesperson, said internal investigations are ongoing.
“​​Our processes remain consistent: every inmate death is treated with the utmost seriousness,” she said by email. “Each case undergoes a thorough internal review by both our Medical and Institutions Divisions, as well as an external and independent review by the Department of Public Safety and the State Medical Examiner. Of the three deaths referenced, two were anticipated by medical personnel—specific details of which we are legally prohibited from sharing due to HIPAA regulations.”
There have been three wrongful death lawsuits filed against DOC since 2022. In March, the family of Lewis Jordan Jr. and the ACLU of Alaska filed a lawsuit for the 53-year-old’s death in Goose Creek Correctional Center in 2023 alleging staff displayed “deliberate indifference” and ignored his pleas for medical attention for an ear infection. His condition deteriorated into fatal meningitis, and he later died after weeks in a coma and his family had to remove him from life support.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Democrats, progressive groups and constituents in Colorado’s 8th Congressional District are keeping up the pressure on Republican U.S. Rep Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton as the GOP’s narrow House majority closes in on drastic federal budget cuts that could have a big impact in the battleground district.
More than 100 people gathered Thursday in a high school auditorium in Thornton for the latest in a series of “People’s Town Halls” organized by the Democratic National Committee across the country, in districts where Republican members of Congress have declined to hold in-person town halls themselves. In place of Evans, attendees asked questions of Rep. Greg Casar, a Democrat in his second term representing Texas’ 35th District.
“My title actually isn’t congressman. The title is representative,” Casar told the crowd. “And the person that is supposed to be representing you here in Colorado is not acting like a representative. He’s acting like an employee of the Trump-Musk organization, and he’s not going to show up and answer your questions.”

Casar and Colorado Democratic Party Chair Shad Murib shared the stage with a cardboard cutout of Evans — complete with chicken legs for a lawmaker who Rebecca Miller, a hospice nurse criticizing Evans’ support for Medicaid cuts, said was too “chicken” to hold a proper town hall.
“I’m sure you recognize my voice, since I call you at least once a week,” Miller told the cutout. “Hey Gabe, did you know that 25% of your constituents … are on Medicaid? That’s 73,000 people that you’re getting ready to kick off their health care.”
Evans and his fellow Republicans in Congress are pursuing a major rewrite of the federal budget, and have approved an initial plan calling for trillions of dollars in tax cuts paired with trillions more in cuts to spending programs, including $880 billion in cuts to be made by the committee that oversees Medicaid. That legislative effort has coincided with an unprecedented executive power grab by President Donald Trump’s administration, which has attempted to shut down congressionally-authorized agencies and departments, freeze spending programs, order mass layoffs of federal workers, and take other actions that run contrary to longstanding separation-of-powers principles in the U.S. Constitution.
After multiple House Republicans faced backlash from constituents over the GOP agenda during town halls earlier this year, party leaders advised their members to stop holding in-person events, Politico reported.
Evans, serving his first two-year term after defeating former Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo by about 2,500 votes in the 2024 election, appears to have listened. To date, he has held just a single telephone town hall, answering a select handful of questions on a call that many constituents reported was plagued by technical issues.

“They were told by House Speaker Mike Johnson not to have town halls, so they’re just doing what they’re told,” Casar said.
Though he represents one of the country’s most evenly divided congressional districts, Evans — a former Arvada police officer and Army veteran who served one term in the state Legislature before running for Congress — has done little to distance himself from Trump and his agenda. He has endorsed Trump’s plans to carry out the mass deportations of more than 12 million immigrants in the country without authorization and backed the president’s chaotic efforts to launch a global trade war.
In a statement, Delanie Bomar, an Evans spokesperson, called Casar a far-left activist “who wants to see socialism and transgenderism take over America.”
“He represents the total opposite of Congressman Gabe Evans’ commonsense and winning plan of improving public safety, the immigration system, and the economy,” Bomar said. “Any day with Greg Casar in Colorado’s 8th District is a day that helps re-elect Gabe Evans in 2026.”
With Evans absent, critics of the Republican agenda have sought to fill the vacuum with events of their own, including a March 22 event in Northglenn organized by local groups. Last month, more than 10,000 people turned out for a rally in Greeley to hear from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who taunted Evans from the stage for refusing to meet with his constituents.
Thursday’s town hall was jointly organized by the DNC and the Colorado Democratic Party. Two other events are planned for this weekend: a Medicaid-focused event organized by labor groups, scheduled for Friday evening at the Thornton Community Center; and a town hall at 10 a.m. on Saturday at the Moxie Theater in Greeley.
Medicaid cuts
The 8th District is Colorado’s most diverse — about 40% of its residents are Latino — and most competitive House seat. Drawn by an independent redistricting commission after the 2020 census awarded Colorado an additional congressional seat, it extends from Denver’s northern suburbs to Greeley and more rural areas in southern Weld County.
With Republicans holding just a three-vote majority in the House, the 8th District race could again prove crucial in determining control of Congress in the 2026 midterms. Caraveo earlier this month announced she would seek to win her old seat back next year, but first she faces a primary contest against Democratic state Rep. Manny Rutinel of Commerce City.
Murib said that despite Democrats’ relatively strong performance in Colorado in 2024, the loss of the 8th District race was a disappointment the party is eager to make up for next year.
“We are not going to let Gabe Evans continue to be employee of the month for Donald Trump,” Murib said. “We are not going to continue to let this cardboard cutout stay away from the people.”
Polls show that cuts to Medicaid, which provides health care to more than 1 in 5 Americans, are deeply unpopular, with 82% of Americans believing that funding for the program should be increased or kept the same, according to a March KFF survey.
Evans has defended House Republicans’ budget resolution, which mandates the $880 billion in cuts from the committee that oversees Medicaid spending, by falsely claiming that there are “a wide range of places where those cost savings can be found.” The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that Medicaid comprises 93% of the spending that could be cut by the committee. As a result, the GOP’s budget requires a minimum of $700 billion in Medicaid cuts over 10 years — or a 10% reduction in projected spending.
Evans sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will be responsible for implementing the Medicaid cuts required by the budget plan. Casar noted that with Republicans holding only a razor-thin majority, it would only require a handful of GOP House members to “replace the chicken legs with normal legs” to derail the budget plan.
“Your organizing from here over the course of the next few weeks could save Medicaid as we know it,” Casar said. “That’s why I got on a plane all the way over here to do this. … I know we can and will do it.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota House overwhelmingly rejected an Education Savings Account bill Thursday night, a day after the governor vetoed a similar bill.
House members voted 78-14 against Senate Bill 2400, which sought to provide private school vouchers plus Education Savings Accounts for public school and homeschooled students.
In vetoing House Bill 1540, which only benefited private school students, Gov. Kelly Armstrong urged lawmakers to move the competing proposal forward.
Armstrong vetoes North Dakota private school voucher bill, but signals support for competing bill

But the $110 million price tag to the Senate bill is likely why many opposed it, said House Majority Leader Mike Lefor, R-Dickinson.
Lefor, who supported the bill, said he doesn’t see a path for an Education Savings Account proposal to come back this session.
“I’m a strong advocate for school choice, and I will continue to be,” Lefor said.
The bill, sponsored by Sen. Michelle Axtman, R-Bismarck, included vouchers for private school students ranging from $1,000 to $3,500 per student, depending on household income. The dollars could be spent on tuition or other qualifying educational expenses.
Public school and homeschooled students would be eligible for $1,000 for educational expenses. Private school students attending schools that don’t participate in the program would be eligible for $500.
The House Education Committee voted 11-3 to give the bill a do-not-pass recommendation. Rep. Dori Hauck, R-Hebron, a member of the committee, said members were concerned about the complexity of the bill and the administrative burden to oversee it.
“Questions remain about how easily DPI (Department of Public Instruction) could implement, manage and expand the system without significant additional staffing and resources,” Hauck said.
Supporters have advocated for expanding educational opportunities for students and giving parents more power over their children’s education. Opponents objected to spending public dollars to pay for private school tuition. Axtman’s bill included $3 million in the event it passed and was challenged by a lawsuit.
Armstrong advocated for a school choice bill that benefited all students, not only those who attend private school. Others questioned spending additional money on public school students when the state already invests in K-12 education.
Bills look to expand North Dakota student opportunities through savings accounts

Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, the chief sponsor of the bill vetoed by Armstrong, said he believes it will be difficult to get enough support to overturn the governor’s veto.
Koppelman said he plans to introduce a bill during the 2027 legislative session that is “a bit more wide sweeping.” 
“We’ll come back next session,” he said. 
Lawmakers began the legislative session with five Education Savings Account bills, but none of the proposals remain under consideration. 
Rep. Don Vigesaa, R-Cooperstown, said he voted against bills with public dollars for private school tuition because he represents a rural area that doesn’t have private schools.
“I guess this session just wasn’t the right time,” Vigesaa said.

(Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Legislature’s Joint Committee for the Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR) deadlocked Thursday on whether to object to a proposed administrative rule that would guide the conduct of election observers at polling places. 
The 5-5 vote moves the rule one step closer to going into effect because if the committee doesn’t take any action, it will be returned to the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) to be implemented. 
Even though the rule was written by WEC with input from an advisory committee that included members of right-wing election conspiracy groups, election skeptics opposed the rule’s passage at a number of public hearings. 
At a hearing on Monday, 2020 election deniers — including former state Rep. Janel Brandtjen — testified in opposition to the rule because they believed it didn’t do enough to protect the rights of election observers. Lawmakers on the committee, including its co-chair, Rep. Adam Neylon (R-Pewaukee), complained that the rule was written without enough input from legislators. 
Despite that opposition, Rep. Kevin Petersen (R-Waupaca) joined with the committee’s four Democrats, Sens. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove) and Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and Reps. Margaret Arney (D-Wauwatosa) and Lee Snodgrass (D-Appleton) to vote against the motion objecting to the rule’s passage. 
In Monday’s hearing, election commissioner Don Millis said the rule gives the state the best chance to clarify how election observers should conduct themselves while protecting the rights of voters. 
“I don’t agree with everything in the rule, but I don’t want the perfect to be the enemy of the good,” he said. “Without this rule, municipal clerks have wide ranging authorities to manage polling places as they see fit. There’s no reasonable argument that observers are better off without this rule.”
While Thursday’s vote is a step toward implementation, the rule is still in the committee until May 11, according to the office of the committee’s other co-chair, Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater). The committee could vote on the issue again before then.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — House lawmakers questioned the qualifications of the mental health department’s chief financial officer after he was unable to provide basic information about the agency’s budget shortfall and why it cannot pay its bills. 
Lawmakers spent three hours peppering Skip Leonard with questions about the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services’ $43 million deficit, what steps they’ve taken to fill the gap, and how a $6.2 million supplemental request would be enough to carry the agency through the end of the fiscal year. 
Leonard, the agency’s interim chief financial officer tasked with managing the agency’s over $610 million budget, was unable to give specific examples to many questions, but promised a renewed budget request of the Legislature by next week. 
Leonard’s testimony, which was made under oath, filled the second day of a special House committee hearing investigating the agency’s finances. Lawmakers are probing reports of financial disarray at the agency as well as why some provider contracts were abruptly cut or canceled. Allie Friesen, the mental health commissioner, who testified last week has pointed fingers at previous administrations for financial problems and a failure to make proper budget requests.

During her testimony, Friesen told lawmakers to ask Leonard for specifics about the agency’s financial shortfalls.
Frustration visibly built among lawmakers throughout the meeting as Leonard and the agency’s general counsel, Christina Green, were unable to explain the numbers being presented.  
Rep. T.J. Marti, R-Broken Arrow, asked Leonard about his qualifications to be the chief financial officer of a state agency. 
Leonard said he was formerly a city manager who has dealt with large budgets, but is not a certified public accountant and has no experience leading finances for a state agency. 
“I’m guessing I’m not the only one in here at this point that’s mildly confused at the CFO of the agency not being able to be the one that can do a deep dive into issues,” Marti said. “I’m appreciating what you’re bringing to the table … but if the chief financial officer of the (agency) is more of a visionary on community outreach and not diving deep into these issues, I find that concerning.” 
Leonard said he was not initially hired to be a CFO. Leonard’s LinkedIn profile lists his initial role with the agency as “executive partnership consultant,” which he began in November. He said he received “no formal training” from the agency when he became interim CFO. 
He said he first became aware of the deficit around 4 p.m. Feb. 21 after an agency budget director brought it to his attention. At first, agency officials believed the deficit was $63.7 million, but after further investigation, they later lowered the shortfall to $43 million. Leonard also said the agency spent $9.5 million from its budget for the current fiscal year on last year’s debts.
Marti said Leonard’s hourly pay rate adds up to $343,000 if he were to be employed full time for a year at his current hourly rate of $165 per hour. No listing has been posted for a permanent CFO yet, as Leonard said they’re waiting until the agency “gets through” its current budget situation.
Marti said in the last year, the agency hired 20 employees with salaries $100,000 or more. He said 12 more had their salaries raised to that level, and another 13 were hired with salaries under six figures. 
Rep. Ellyn Hefner, D-Oklahoma City, also questioned Leonard’s apparent lack of understanding on specifics of the agency’s finances. 
“Respectfully, Mr. Leonard, do you recognize your lack of knowledge and skill?” she said. “Why would you stay in this position, with all these months going by, making critical decisions that have definitely hit providers in our districts?”
After the hearing, Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, who chaired the special committee, said he still has a lot of questions, and it’s concerning that there isn’t more clarity and certainty in the two months since the department leaders were made aware of the deficit. 
“We started all of this to have more confidence in the numbers that have been presented,” he said. “I don’t know that I have any more confidence today than the day when we started. But we’re committed to getting this information so that we can make the best decisions that we can before sine die.”
He said he’s not sure why the agency only needs a $6.2 million supplemental.

House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, also said during the hearing that he doesn’t understand how the supplemental budget request could cover such a large deficit. 
“Essentially, the department had a $9.5 million structural deficit from the jump,” he said. “And you’re short and you’re only asking for $6.2 million. I would say, publicly, that’s great if all we need is $6.2 million, but Mr. Leonard, the math is just not adding up.”
Leonard, who said he assumed the interim role in January, said he “can’t answer all those questions completely,” but told lawmakers $2.9 million in contracts were cut, the agency found $8 million in “fixed utilization savings,” and another $3.5 million to $4 million in contract cuts within the department. 
Lawmakers also asked the mental health department’s general counsel, Green, questions focused on nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements signed by executive staff within the agency. 
Green said state law doesn’t allow or preclude state agencies from having employees sign such agreements and said they were requested by Friesen to prevent information from being leaked from executive staff meetings on sensitive internal investigations. 
Green said she drafted an initial NDA from an existing agency draft, but later found it was too restrictive as it would allow the agency to pursue monetary damages against employees. She then created a second, briefer confidentiality agreement. 
Leonard and Green said signing the agreements was optional. Leonard and Green both signed such agreements. 
Rep. Chris Kannady, R-Oklahoma City, said there was “indication” that the agency’s director of workplace violence and behavioral threat assessment had held a meeting with those asked to sign the agreements, threatening to go “full cop mode” if they weren’t signed. 
Green and Leonard both said they were not present at the meeting, didn’t know who attended, or what was discussed. 
House officials hope to hold additional hearings next week, including one with Regina Birchum, executive director of the Legislative Office of Fiscal Transparency. LOFT is also investigating the mental health department’s finances in addition to the committee, the state auditor and a “special investigator.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A key Republican Senate leader has proposed the Legislature reject academic standards for social studies and science after half of the Oklahoma State Board of Education said Thursday they weren’t aware changes were made to the standards before they voted to approve them. 
Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, filed the resolution Thursday, citing the limited time board members had to review the final draft of the standards and the “magnitude of the decision” they made. Pugh leads the Senate Education Committee.
The resolution states “questions exist regarding the transparency of the subject matter standard adoption process.” Pugh also noted the standards would cost $33 million to implement with new textbooks and classroom materials.
Academic standards dictate what topics public schools must teach to students. The social studies standards have attracted significant controversy over their inclusion of Bible stories and the last-minute addition of language suggesting there were “discrepancies” in 2020 election results.
Pugh is the first Republican lawmaker to publicly support rejecting the proposed standards. It is also the first time any lawmakers have suggested disapproving the standards for science. 
He did not immediately return a request for comment Thursday evening.
To reject the standards would send them back to the state Board of Education for further review, which is what at least one board member, Ryan Deatherage, has said he hopes the Legislature will do. The current standards, approved in 2019, would remain in effect until a new version is approved.
Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday encouraged the Legislature to take action on the standards and raised doubts about the integrity of the board’s approval process. Stitt alleged officials at the Oklahoma State Department of Education emailed board members a different version of the standards from what they ultimately voted on.

State Superintendent Ryan Walters, who leads the agency and the board, said Thursday this is untrue. Records from the Education Department indicate the board members received the updated version of the standards at 4 p.m. the day before they took a vote the following morning on Feb. 27.
Making changes to the proposed draft based on public comment and input from focus groups has long been a common practice at the Education Department, Walters said.
Deatherage and two other recent appointees to the board, Chris Van Denhende and Mike Tinney, said Walters failed to notify them that changes had been made to the standards from the original draft posted for public comment in December. The board met Thursday for the first time since it approved the standards in February.
Walters said he couldn’t control whether the board members read the materials provided to them nor that the governor placed them on the board at the end of the 10-month process to develop the new standards.
“All those board members, we didn’t have their information,” Walters said after the meeting Thursday. “We’re sitting here trying to struggle to make sure they can actually legally sit for the (Feb. 27) meeting. So, that’s kind of the behind-the-scenes of what we were trying to do to get a board meeting off. So I say all that to say they knew that they’d been updated.”
House and Senate Democrats filed resolutions earlier this month to similarly reject the social studies standards in full.
However, Republican leaders of the House and Senate said there hasn’t been enough consensus among the GOP supermajority to ensure a rejection of the standards would pass in either chamber.
Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said Thursday the “decision has not been made” on how senators will proceed in light of the governor’s comments this week.
“It is open,” Paxton said. “We are looking at it again.”
Pugh’s resolution would need to pass both the House and Senate by May 1 to reject the standards.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said a vote from his Republican caucus “doesn’t look likely.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)The data center industry that powers everything online is reshaping the energy marketplace and Pennsylvania is poised to see an economic boost as companies like Amazon and Microsoft move into the state.
But regulators must strike a balance between feeding a data center’s voracious appetite for electricity and ensuring that the lights stay on and costs remain reasonable for regular people, members of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission heard Thursday.
“Pennsylvania is an attractive location for data center operators due to low cost rural land and property taxes, as well as the currently abundant supply of natural gas and excess electricity,” Allison Kaster, director of the commission’s Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement, said.
And the demand for data is constantly increasing, said Michael Fradette, an energy expert for Amazon Data Services, which last year purchased a data center campus in Luzerne County that will eventually consume about as much electricity as the city of Pittsburgh.
In addition to critical government and financial operations, video conferencing, remote learning, telehealth, artificial intelligence and online gaming all run off data centers. And those are competing with other sectors, such as transportation, heating and cooling and manufacturing, where the demand for electricity is also growing, Fradette said.
“We recognize the need for a balanced approach that supports technology, technological advancement, sustainable energy practices and fair cost allocation,” said Fradette, who was one of four data center industry experts who testified before the PUC.
On the other side of the electric meter are the electricity companies that distribute power for homes, offices and industry and the grid operator. Pennsylvania’s grid is operated by PJM Interconnection, which also serves all or part of 12 northeast and midwest states by ensuring there’s enough power generation to meet demands.
PJM estimates that its peak demand will grow nearly 17% by 2035. While it faces its own problems connecting new powerplants fast enough to satisfy that growth, the task of ensuring the electrical infrastructure is up to the challenge falls largely to electricity distribution companies such as PECO Energy, PPL Electric Utilities and FirstEnergy Pennsylvania Electric Co.
“This potential demand growth is unlike anything we have ever dealt with before,” Richard Webster, vice president for regulatory policy & strategy at Peco, said. Webster was one of four electricity company representatives who testified.
The cost of maintaining and upgrading electricity infrastructure by local electric utilities is passed along to customers according to rates that are approved by the PUC. But the demand from data centers will require electric utilities to build new substations and infrastructure.
PUC Chairman Stephen DeFrank said the commission’s goal is to develop a regulatory structure – known as a tariff – for data centers and other large-load customers that allows them to connect to the grid quickly, while ensuring that consumers aren’t left to pay the cost for projects that don’t pan out.
That’s likely to include financial security requirements to cover the cost of engineering studies and construction. The tariff may include incentives for developers who build their own infrastructure and equipment, which often requires long lead times. 
“If they build that out, and decide not to come, well that’s their dime. It’s not the rate payer’s dime, and that’s what we’re concerned about,” DeFrank told the Capital-Star.
At the same time, the commission needs to ensure that developers who want to build in Pennsylvania can do so on a schedule that makes sense for business. 
“We will never have a load-growth opportunity in our lifetime again like this,” DeFrank said. “This is the industrial revolution for the information age. This is equivalent to … the printing press.”
The PUC will accept written public comments until May 27 and replies to comments until June 11. Instructions for submitting comments are on the hearing website.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/three-mile-island-2024-1024x767.jpeg,,,2025-04-24 20:59:34.382003

Martin Carbaugh, R-Fort Wayne, listens to bills in the House Chamber on April 24, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Much of the compromise reached for House Enrolled Act 1004 mirrors what left the Senate earlier this month. Penalties for five nonprofit health systems exceeding “price caps” have now been pushed off into 2029 — after the Office of Management and Budget identifies the “average hospital rate” for certain inpatient and outpatient services. 
The final version retained a provision to strip nonprofit hospitals of their tax-exempt status under Indiana code as well as enhanced reporting metrics. 
“Even with those changes, we are making meaningful, incremental changes to provide relief to our constituents,” said author Rep. Martin Carbaugh, R-Fort Wayne. 
Most House Democrats opposed the bill, citing concerns about what losing a nonprofit status could mean for a community. 
“(The) loss of nonprofit state versus a penalty will impact what benefits are provided to the community to keep Hoosiers healthier and prevent the unnecessary use of hospital services,” said Rep. Robin Shackleford, D-Indianapolis. 
A provision allowing the state to phase out the Healthy Indiana Plan, which covers low- and moderate-income Hoosiers, if federal funds are not allocated also gave her pause. 
“There is nothing in this bill that ensures that patients will pay less for quality health care, but there is a lot of red tape,” she continued. “And there is an increase in administration and labor fees, so we will be voting no.”
Shackleford and 22 other lawmakers — including one Republican — voted against the bill in the House. 
For the first time, the state will also institute a Managed Care Assessment Fee, similar to the provider tax known as the Hospital Assessment Fee, which could reap a maximum $1.4 billion annually — though the rate would need to be negotiated with the federal government. 
  Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, speaks against legislation making Indiana school boards partisan on Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Additionally, insurer negotiations with hospitals will be separated from Medicare Advantage deals — even if the insurer offers both. Combined with a reconfigured Hospital Assessment Fee that will leverage a larger federal reimbursement to health systems, Republicans said rural hospitals notched some wins. 
“Two-thirds of Indiana nonprofit hospitals benefited more from the federal, state and local tax breaks than they invested back into their communities,” said Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown. “… this bill is going to put more dollars into our rural systems all across the state.”
But reliable opposing Sens. Liz Brown and Tyler Johnson — Republicans from Fort Wayne and Leo, respectively — shared their discontent with setting pricing standards for any industry. Both have ties to Parkview Health, one of the five systems named in the bill, which recently announced a deal to purchase a struggling hospital in Cass County that would have otherwise closed.
“If they lose their not-for-profit status, they lose their license. Which means they can’t operate at all … they have to close their doors,” Brown said. 
She worried that, under such a situation, a for-profit chain would only buy certain facilities, leaving out the rural hospitals that depend on their nonprofit status.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A powerful Alaska Senate committee is considering a draft of Alaska’s state operating budget that would cut more than $200 million from a version adopted earlier this month by the state House.
The Senate Finance Committee unveiled the first draft of its operating budget proposal during a Thursday morning meeting in the Capitol at Juneau.
The biggest item on the committee’s chopping block was a significant public school funding increase. The House voted for an $81 million bump in K-12 public school funding above what lawmakers and Gov. Mike Dunleavy approved last year. 
That increase is gone in the Senate’s budget, as is almost every other budget addition proposed by the House. Dunleavy proposed budget increases as well — for state troopers, health care and additional staff in various state departments — and almost all of those were eliminated, too.
“Those were eliminated from the budget, along with the request that the governor had for all other increments, because of our financial condition,” said Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel and the member of the finance committee in charge of writing its draft budget for state services and programs.
Despite cuts, notable deficit remains
Even with the Senate’s cuts, preliminary figures show that the operating budget — when combined with other budget bills — still contains a deficit of between $70 million and $140 million.
That figure will almost certainly change, because some costs — particularly labor contracts — have not yet been determined.
“We are still in deficit mode. There is still work that needs to be done on this budget to have it balance,” Hoffman said.
The bipartisan majority in charge of the state Senate has vowed to write a balanced budget that does not require spending from savings. 
The document revealed Thursday keeps to that pledge. Unlike the House version of the budget, there’s no section unlocking the Constitutional Budget Reserve, the $2.8 billion fund that is the state’s largest savings account.
The committee’s proposal keeps a roughly $1,400 Permanent Fund dividend approved by the House; at $950 million, that is the third-largest item in the budget, behind education and health spending, respectively.
Among the committee’s few additions are additions to the state’s wildfire-response and disaster-response funds. These additions would bring the funds up to the amount needed to pay for average annual expenses over the past five years.
Cuts to child care and corrections proposals
The committee’s proposed elimination of House-adopted increases are much more significant. 
Among them: Permanently closing part of Spring Creek prison to save $7.5 million per year, eliminating double-overtime pay for some prison guards to save $6 million per year, cutting teacher recruitment programs to save $1 million per year, reversing a funding increase for Parents as Teachers and the Dolly Parton Imagination Library, eliminating grants to child advocacy centers to save $5.5 million, and eliminating more than $13 million intended to improve access to child care.
Funding increases proposed by the House for senior services were eliminated, as was money for athletics programs and research facilities at the University of Alaska Anchorage and University of Alaska Fairbanks.
Hoffman noted that no action taken by the finance committee is final. The budget bill is subject to amendments in committee, debate on the Senate floor, and then any differences between the House and Senate may be negotiated in a conference committee whose task will be to find a compromise between the two drafts.
“There’s a large difference between the House and Senate at this time. There’s a lot of work left to do at the conference table,” he said.

He was put to death Thursday April, 24 2025. (Alabama Department of Corrections)The state of Alabama executed James Osgood by lethal injection Thursday for his role in the 2010 rape and murder of Tracy Brown.
It was the second execution conducted by the state this year.
“I haven’t said her name since that day,” Osgood said before the start of the execution according to media witnesses. “I felt like it was disrespectful to say it. But then sometimes I felt like it was disrespectful not to. Today, it will be the first time I say her name. ‘Tracy, I apologize.’”
Osgood, 55, was pronounced dead at 6:35 p.m,, according to a news release from Gov. Kay Ivey, which referred to Brown by the last name of Wilemon. Court records used Brown to identify the victim.
“The murder of Tracy Wilemon was premeditated, gruesome and disturbing, and tonight, the state carried out the death sentence of James Osgood,” Ivey said in her news release. “Both Mr. Osgood and his accomplice – who will never see the light of day – from the moment they were inspired by a Hollywood torture scene, set out to commit this heinous crime against Ms. Wilemon and are now paying the price.
“I pray that her loved ones can feel some sense of closure today,” Ivey said.
Media witnesses did not observe any complications with the execution. The curtain opened at 6:05 p.m. and witnesses saw some labored breathing along with Osgood moving his fingers until he stopped moving all together at 6:18 p.m. Staff then closed the curtain at 6:25 p.m.
Osgood and his then girlfriend, Tonya Van Dyke, accompanied Brown to her home in 2010 and then proceeded to sexually assault and kill her.
Van Dyke pleaded guilty for her role in Brown’s death in exchange for the district attorney removing the death penalty from consideration. She was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Osgood was convicted of two counts of capital murder in 2014, the second charge due to the fact the murder was committed during a sexual assault.
The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals remanded the case back to the Chilton County trial court in 2016, ruling that the trial judge had made an error in the instructions to the jury during the penalty phase of the trial.
In 2018, just as the court was about to empanel a jury for the case, Osgood requested that he be put to death because he said he believes in an “eye for an eye” approach.
The state executed Demetrius Frazier in February for the rape and murder of Pauline Brown in Birmingham in 1991. Earlier this year, Ivey commuted the sentence of Robin “Rocky” Myers from the death penalty to life in prison, saying she was not convinced of his guilt.
“This evening, the State of Alabama executed James Osgood for a crime that he committed 15 years ago,” said Alison Mollman, ACLU of Alabama legal director, the attorney who represented him. “Although Mr. Osgood had many years of appeals remaining in his case, he volunteered for execution to demonstrate his atonement and, in his words, to complete the sentence he received in his case—death by lethal injection. While he knows that no words or expressed remorse can repair the harm that his previous actions caused, he hopes that his decision brings the victim’s family closer to healing.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/James-Osgood-horizontal-2025-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-04-24 20:59:34.382003

(Nevada Gaming Commission stream screengrab)The Nevada Gaming Commission approved a stipulated agreement Thursday stemming from a complaint filed last week by the Nevada Gaming Control Board against MGM Resorts International. The complaint alleged MGM allowed three illegal bookmakers to gamble at the company’s properties, despite knowledge of, or suspicions about their sources of income. 
“One bad apple can ruin years of great work,” Nevada Gaming Commissioner and former Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki said moments before the Commission approved the $8.5 million stipulated fine agreed to by MGM. 
But a few bad apples can prove costly, if not damaging, to the state’s largest casino conglomerate, which won praise from regulators, even as they imposed the massive fine for allowing the bookmakers to gamble on more than 700 separate days at the MGM Grand and the Cosmopolitan, which the company later purchased.  
“2,600 customers in the last 10 years have been banned from your property,” Krolicki noted. “46,000 SARS (suspicious activity reports) have been filed. That is a culture of compliance. You should be proud of it.”
“I do feel that this is a much different situation than what we’ve seen in other cases,” Commissioner Rosa Solis-Rainey said. “MGM did have a strong culture of compliance, not just because they were already in trouble. It’s something that you had long before the trouble arose.”
MGM long sought to be a leader in gaming compliance, said Scott Scherer, a former Gaming Control Board member who represented the company before the commission and serves on its compliance committee. 
“Unfortunately, this case exposed one of the weaknesses in that program – when employees forget their responsibilities or decide not to fulfill those responsibilities, whether it is because they are going rogue, or because they think that’s what their customers, supervisors, or peers would want them to do.”
Scherer added that “all culpable employees had either left the company voluntarily before these issues came to light, or have been terminated…”  
“This is not an organization where compliance is a priority until it’s inconvenient for the business,” MGM General Counsel John McManus told the commission. “Compliance is what makes the business possible.”
McManus said although MGM could have done better, the company was consistent with industry best practices. 
“I’m not here to beat up on individual former employees who made poor decisions and mistakes that many of them, all of them really, paid a significant price for,” McManus said.
Former MGM Grand president Scott Sibella entered a guilty plea in federal court for failing to file a suspicious activity report in 2018.  He also agreed to give up his Nevada gaming license for five years. 
Commissioner Abbi Silver recused herself from the MGM item, citing her long friendship with Sibella. 
The Current was first to report in 2023 that the Criminal Division of the Internal Revenue Service was investigating MGM and Resorts World. The Nevada Gaming Commission last month approved a stipulated agreement in which Resorts World agreed to pay a $10.5 million fine.

Arkansans must bring a valid driver’s license and pay a $12 fee to obtain a birth certificate. More information about obtaining birth certificates is available on the health department’s website. 
Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration officials earlier this week announced driver’s license offices in five cities would also have extended hours Saturday to assist Arkansans attempting to acquire their REAL IDs ahead of next month’s deadline. 
Offices in Little Rock, Fayetteville, Jonesboro, Texarkana and Monticello will be open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Saturday. Appointments are recommended but not required, and can be scheduled on the finance department’s website.
REAL IDs began with a 2005 law passed by Congress in response to the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Instituting REAL IDs statewide “will help fight terrorism and reduce identity fraud,” according to the finance department website.
REAL IDs are signified by a gold star on a driver’s license or state-issued ID card. The state finance department has issued roughly 140,000 REAL IDs since Jan. 1, including 52,000 in March, bringing the statewide total to roughly 800,000, DFA Secretary Jim Hudson said in a Tuesday press conference.

Now, the plaintiffs are also challenging the state’s closed primary election system and its limits on how and when Wyoming voters may affiliate with a political party, according to an amended complaint filed April 18. 
The laws violate the Wyoming Constitution’s guarantee of “political equality,” the plaintiffs argue, and “impermissibly discriminate against candidates and voters not affiliated with a major political party.” 
Among the plaintiffs are Matt Malcom of Laramie County and Jeff Thomas of Platte County. Both ran as Republicans for legislative seats but lost in the 2024 primary election. And state law prevented both from running as independent candidates in the general election. 
Jim Roscoe, a former independent lawmaker from Wilson, and Jim Rooks, a former Jackson Town Council member, are also plaintiffs in the case alongside Joshua Malcom, a registered voter of Laramie County, and Christina Kitchen, a registered voter of Teton County.

The suit names Chuck Gray, in his capacity as secretary of state, as the defendant. Gray did not respond to WyoFile’s request for comment by press time. Previously, he said he supported the law prohibiting primary election runner-ups from running as independents in the general election.
“The statute is there for a good reason,” Gray told WyoFile last August.
How we got here
For decades, Wyoming had a partially open primary election system. That meant voters were restricted to casting ballots in races that aligned with their political party affiliation, which they were allowed to change on election day and during most of the early voting period.
The one time voters couldn’t change affiliation included the two weeks leading up to election day. Then in 2023, Wyoming lawmakers extended that period to 96 days leading up to the primary election in order to ban what’s known as crossover-voting. 
The new timeline lines up with the candidate filing period, requiring voters to affiliate with a party before the slate of candidates has been finalized. 
Supporters said the law was needed to stop registered Democrats, minor party and unaffiliated voters from changing their party affiliation in order to participate as Republicans in the primary election. 
They also pointed to the 2018 primary election when Gov. Mark Gordon secured the Republican nomination in the governor’s race. Gordon’s opponents said he was only able to win due to the support of “crossover” Democrats. Those claims were shown to be statistically unfounded, but endured nonetheless.
Plaintiffs 
The new party affiliation law prevented Joshua Malcom, one of the plaintiffs, from casting a vote for his brother, Matthew, in the 2024 primary election for House District 61.
Joshua is a Laramie County unaffiliated voter because he “does not wish to be a member of any political party,” according to the suit. As a result, however, Joshua could not cast a vote for his preferred candidate, his brother, because he is not a registered Republican. 
Joshua was further precluded from doing so when Matthew was not allowed to run as an independent candidate, the lawsuit states. 
Enacted in 1973, Wyoming’s “sore loser law” stipulates “an unsuccessful candidate for office at a primary election whose name is printed on any party ballot may not accept nomination for the same office at the next general election.” 
In Teton County, plaintiff Christina Kitchen was prevented from voting for her brother-in-law, Jim Rooks, when he ran as a Democrat for the Teton County Commission in 2024. Kitchen was a registered Republican at the time. 
“The ability to change affiliation to vote in the primary of her choice has been and remains important to Kitchen because of her desire to vote for the person she deems most qualified and who supports her views rather than those who are affiliated with a particular political party,” according to the complaint. 
The law also prohibited Rooks, another plaintiff in the case, from running as an independent in the general election after he lost his primary election bid.

In 2022, Jim Roscoe declined to seek reelection for House District 22, which he’d represented as the Legislature’s sole independent. That lack of an affiliation has prevented him from participating in Wyoming’s primary elections. 
Roscoe believes, according to the lawsuit, that Wyoming’s major political parties “have become increasingly dominated by platforms and views of those in control of the national parties, extreme in their views, rhetoric, and actions, and unduly hostile to the members of opposing parties.”
As such, he “has an interest in and believes that giving Wyoming voters a greater number of candidate choices and more opportunities to elect independent candidates unaffiliated with any political party will help moderate the above-described trends he sees in Wyoming’s political parties.”
The complaint
The lawsuit highlights several sections of the Wyoming Constitution, including its “Equal Political Rights” provision. 
“Since equality in the enjoyment of natural and civil rights is only made sure through political equality, the laws of this state effecting the political rights and privileges of its citizens shall be without distinction of race, color, sex, or any other circumstance or condition whatsoever (emphasis added by plaintiffs) other than individual incompetency, or unworthiness duly ascertained by a court of competent jurisdiction,” Article 1, Section 3 reads. 
The complaint also points to other sections of the constitution that require the Legislature to craft laws so that “the names of all candidates for the same office, to be voted for at any election, shall be printed on the same ballot,” and that “elections shall be open, free and equal, and no power, civil or military, shall at any time interfere to prevent an untrammeled exercise of the right of suffrage.” 
As such, the plaintiffs are asking the court for a declaratory judgment, or to clarify their legal rights and the obligations of the state.

Screenshot via Court TVBURLINGTON — A New Hampshire man has been sentenced to 42½ years in prison for shooting and killing his wife in a camper in Bolton. They had traveled to Vermont to mark their one-year wedding anniversary. Judge John Pacht handed down the jail term to 45-year-old Joseph Ferlazzo Jr. during a nearly daylong hearing Thursday in Chittenden County Superior criminal court in Burlington. A jury convicted Ferlazzo of first-degree murder in December in the fatal shooting of his 22-year-old wife, Emily Ferlazzo, in October 2021. First-degree murder carries a sentence of 35 years to life in prison. The sentence of more than four decades behind bars for Joseph Ferlazzo was less than what the prosecution urged — at least 50 years — and more than what the defense had sought, which was 15 years. “Emily Ferlazzo had a beautiful, beautiful voice and I’m not just referring to her singing which we heard today,” Pacht said as he delivered the sentence, recalling a video played of her earlier in Thursday’s hearing.“It extended to all areas of her life,” the judge said. “It was a voice that deserved to be heard. It was a voice that deserved to grow, mature, and if necessary to heal, and it deserved to do that for a long happy life.”But, Pacht said, that didn’t happen as her life ended far too soon. “And,” the judge said, “it was cut short at the hands of Joseph Ferlazzo.” Pacht called it a “horrendous” crime and a case of “extreme” domestic violence. READ MORE





 


Jury convicts New Hampshire man of first-degree murder in fatal shooting of his wife in Bolton

Murder and cover-up During the trial, the prosecution had argued that Joseph Ferlazzo shot and killed Emily Ferlazzo after an argument in their camper van, hours after they arrived in Bolton to visit with relatives and celebrate their one-year wedding anniversary. In reaching its verdict in December, the jury rejected Joseph Ferlazzo’s testimony that he acted in self-defense. The shooting, according to the prosecution, took place after Emily Ferlazzo told him she no longer wanted to be with him. A video statement Joseph Ferlazzo provided to police after his arrest in which he admitted to shooting and killing his wife made no mention of a self-defense claim. Ferlazzo was arrested four days after the killing, when he was spotted by a state trooper at a St. Albans convenience store, according to charging documents in the case and trial testimony. After the killing, according to the prosecution, he worked to cover up the crime and claimed that his wife was missing. Police later found her dismembered remains inside the camper van. Ferlazzo, a Northfield, New Hampshire, resident at the time of his arrest, had been employed as a tattoo artist. Emily Ferlazzo had worked as a nurse. Chittenden County State’s Attorney Sarah George, who prosecuted the case along with Deputy State’s Attorney Sally Adams, said during the hearing Thursday that asking for the prison term of 50 years to life for Joseph Ferlazzo was not a decision made lightly.George said she took into consideration the violent acts he committed, the many lies he told, the cover-up he tried to carry out after the killing, including the dismemberment of his wife’s body, and his attempts to shift blame for his actions to Emily Ferlazzo that were “not corroborated by any shred of evidence.”During her sentencing argument for a much lesser prison term, Margaret Jansch, Joseph Ferlazzo’s attorney, told the judge that her client had no prior criminal record. She also called Thomas Powell, a forensic psychologist, to take the witness stand. He testified that he found Joseph Ferlazzo had displayed “elements of a personality disorder.”  ‘Strong’ and ‘compassionate’Emily Ferlazzo’s family members and friends filled the courtroom seats Thursday in the gallery behind the prosecution, many wearing red shirts emblazoned with her name and the words, “Love Shouldn’t Hurt.” Some delivered victim impact statements while others had a victim advocate read them on their behalf.They described Emily as a person who cared for others, loved animals, enjoyed singing, dancing and all things “glittery” and “sparkly.” They also spoke of the hole her death had left in their lives, from brothers who no longer had their sister to a best friend who lost the person she confided in. A video was played in the courtroom of Adrienne Bass, Emily Ferlazzo’s mother, speaking of her daughter, punctuated by photos and videos from Emily Ferlazzo’s life.  Bass didn’t use Joseph Ferlazzo’s name during her statement, referring to him as “the convicted,” and she talked about how he controlled and abused her daughter during their relationship. Bass said her daughter was “strong” and “compassionate,” and loved children and dreamed of having babies of her own one day.“The big sister, the only daughter, first granddaughter and great-granddaughter, niece and cousin, a best friend – these were the labels given to Emily in her life,” Bass said of her daughter. “A mother, an auntie, a grandmother, a best friend – the labels that she was denied the day she was murdered.”  Jansch, Joseph Ferlazzo’s attorney, read in the courtroom about a half-dozen letters from people who knew her client and wrote in support of him, from his friends who knew him for several years to a past cellmate.Ferlazzo also spoke briefly during Thursday’s hearing, appearing to read from a paper he was holding.“This event doesn’t define me or who I am,” Ferlazzo said, adding, “I admit that my reaction was too strong and it’s haunted me every day and every night.”He then addressed Emily Ferlazzo’s mother directly though he didn’t look at her as she sat about 20 feet away from him.“Adrienne, I’m so incredibly sorry for what happened,” Joseph Ferlazzo said, and then continued to suggest that his actions that night were in self-defense. “The whole thing was so fast.”As he was speaking, Emily Ferlazzo’s mother got up and walked out of the courtroom, as did several other of her family members.Pacht, the judge, spoke directly to Joseph Ferlazzo as he closed out the hearing.“Mr. Ferlazzo, there are things you can do good while you are incarcerated,” Pacht said to him. “Live your life and try and see where you can grow.”  His attorney said following Thursday’s hearing that an appeal was expected. Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘A voice that deserved to be heard’: judge recalls victim and sentences her killer to 42½ years.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/joseph-farlazzo.jpg?fit=1024%2C708&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 20:04:58.549812

Bob Ferguson’s desk. 
Senate Bill 5390 would raise the price of the annual state public lands pass to $45 from $30 for two vehicles. Transaction fees can apply to pass purchases, including a $5 charge for online sales. 
The Discover Pass allows motor vehicle access to more than 100 state parks and hundreds of other recreation sites on state land. 
The increase would take effect on Oct. 1, 2025. 
An earlier version of the bill would’ve upped the price in July. The House also stripped language from a Senate-approved version of the bill that would have permitted people to use the passes in up to three different vehicles instead of the two allowed under current law.
In the House, the bill passed on Tuesday on a 52-46 vote, with seven Democrats joining Republicans in opposition. The Senate voted 27-21 to accept the House’s rewrite on Thursday, with two Democrats and all Republicans voting against the bill.
The bill would still allow for various discounts for seniors, disabled veterans, families of foster children, and volunteers.
This would be the first increase to the price of the pass since it was introduced about 14 years ago, after budget cuts to state parks and recreation areas around the 2008 recession. 
Democratic lawmakers say the increase would help protect state parks from drastic cuts amid the multibillion-dollar deficit the state is currently facing. 
Revenue from pass sales goes to Washington State Parks, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the Department of Natural Resources, with Washington State Parks receiving the bulk of the revenue.  
The bill also calls for the Office of Financial Management to review the cost of the pass every four years and recommend to the Legislature if adjustments to the price need to be made to account for inflation. 
A work group would also be created to review the efficiency of the funding for state parks and recreational areas and submit a report to the Legislature by Dec. 1, 2026.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/tent-camping-campground-1024x608.jpg,,,2025-04-24 20:04:58.549812

A federal judge on Thursday declared a mistrial in the case of state Sen. Emil Jones III, D-Chicago, after a jury deadlocked in their deliberations over whether Jones agreed to take bribes from red-light camera entrepreneur-turned-government cooperator Omar Maani in 2019, then lied to the FBI about it.

The senator, who’s served 16 years in Springfield since he replaced his father — former Illinois Senate President Emil Jones Jr. — was charged with three counts of bribery and lying to the FBI. Before they began deliberating Monday, jurors heard eight days of arguments, evidence and testimony, including from Jones himself.

The jury sent an initial note indicating they were at a stalemate on two of the counts late Wednesday, which was met with a legally required instruction from the judge encouraging further deliberations Thursday morning. But nearly 23 hours into deliberations early Thursday afternoon, the jury sent another note telling the judge they’d deadlocked on all three counts.

“The jury cannot come to a unanimous verdict on all three counts,” the note read. “No one is willing to surrender their honest beliefs.”

After polling individual members of the jury while white noise blasted through the courtroom’s speakers, U.S. District Judge Andrea Wood said the majority of jurors believed further deliberations would be unlikely to change anything.

The judge then declared a mistrial over the objections of Jones’ attorneys, who wanted the jury to keep deliberating.

“The lack of unanimity in jury room is evidence the government has not met its burden beyond a reasonable doubt,” Jones attorney Joshua Adams told the judge.

But the judge said case law did not support forcing the jury to keep deliberating for that reason and cited the number of hours it had spent in the jury room and the complexity of the case as weighing in favor of a mistrial, which prosecutors supported. She then set the next hearing in the case for June 10.

Jones’ face was placid as Judge Wood went through her rationale to declare a mistrial. While he had several family members present for each day of trial, the courtroom gallery was filled mostly with members of the media.

On his way out of the courtroom, Jones remarked that now he’d have to “go back to work.”

Flanked by his attorneys, Jones gave a brief statement before leaving the Dirksen Federal Courthouse with his stepmother Thursday evening.

“I want to thank the judge, thank the jury, thank the prosecution and most importantly, thank my lawyers,” he said. “I look forward to another fight.”

Jones’ father, the former Senate president, attended most days of trial, listening as his son was accused of benefitting from nepotism and he was accused of having practicing politics that included accepting personal favors.

It’s the third high-profile federal public corruption trial in seven months to end in a hung jury. In February, jurors deliberating former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan’s case deadlocked on six of the 23 counts while convicting him on 10 and acquitting on seven. And in September, a judge had to declare a mistrial after jurors deadlocked on all five counts alleging the former president of AT&T Illinois bribed Madigan in 2017.

In closing arguments Monday, Jones’ attorney Vic Henderson accused the feds of employing the “Dirksen two-step,"" referring to the Dirksen Federal Courthouse where a parade of elected officials have either gone to trial or pleaded guilty over the years. He asked jurors to set aside any bias they might have against Chicago politicians given the “long history” of corruption cases brought to the courthouse.

“It has happened time and time and time again in this building,” Henderson said. “So when yet another government official comes here and is charged, there’s this feeling, ‘Here we go again.’ ... But judge asked each and every one of you if you can be fair.”

Jones last week made the risky decision to testify in his own defense. The last time a sitting state official took the witness stand in their own corruption trial was 20 years ago, when then-state Rep. Patricia Bailey testified in a bench trial before being convicted on election fraud and forgery charges.

During their closing arguments Monday, prosecutors poked holes in Jones’ claims both on the witness stand and to the FBI during a Sept. 24, 2019, interview at his home that Maani made him uncomfortable. Jones last week told the jury that he was trying to avoid taking money from Maani, saying he gave off the vibe of a “used car salesman” and that he was aware Maani was trying to bribe him.

As the pair dined at Jones’ favorite Chicago steakhouse on July 17, 2019, Maani pushed Jones to give him a number for a campaign contribution. After demurring, Jones finally came up with a figure: $5,000.

“If you can raise me five grand, that’d be good,” Jones said after Maani pushed him to come up with a number. “But most importantly, I have an intern working in my office and I’m trying to find him another job, another part-time job while he’s in school. … Do you all have any positions available?”

In closing arguments, Henderson said at that point in the dinner, the senator still believed Maani was trying to participate in a “legitimate fundraiser,” and was just trying to make good on a promise he made to help his former intern find a part-time job.

But Assistant U.S. Attorney Prashant Kolluri said the fact that Jones was still willing to move forward with Maani even after the FBI cooperator hinted that the contribution and job would be part of a bribe indicate that Jones had no objections — despite his testimony six years later.

Kolluri showed the jury an email Jones sent to Maani the week after their July 2019 meeting.

“Had a great time at dinner last week, looking forward to the many more good times my friend,” Jones wrote in his July 24, 2019, email to Maani that contained his former intern’s resume.

“Is that a person who feels uncomfortable around Omar Maani?” Kolluri asked the jury. “Is that evidence of a person who doesn’t want to accept a bribe? No. This is evidence of someone who knows and is a willing participant in this process.”

Road to trial

Even without testifying in his own defense, Jones is also an anomaly as the only sitting state official in more than a decade to take his case to trial; in 2014, then-state Rep. Derrick Smith was convicted on bribery charges. And while not a state official, former Chicago Alderman Patrick Daley Thompson went to trial while still a member of the City Council and resigned the same day of his conviction in 2022.

But the feds’ wide-ranging public corruption probe first made public in 2018 has mostly resulted in elected officials either resigning or pleading guilty after being hit with charges.

Jones, however, told the jury last week that he decided to fight his charges even before they were filed. During a September 2021 meeting at federal offices downtown, the senator and his then-attorney watched the hours of secretly recorded meetings with Maani and the September 2019 FBI interview.

Jones claimed to the jury that after seeing the tapes in full, he concluded the feds “tried to twist what I was saying” when he was initially shown “snippets” of the recordings in February 2020 after his attorney received a letter that charges were imminent.

When charges finally came down in September 2022, Jones declined to resign, despite pressure from Senate leadership and even Gov. JB Pritzker. He won another four-year term to the Illinois Senate in November of that year, although the senator has remained barred from his previous leadership roles, including chairing a committee.

In addition to Jones’ surprise testimony, the jury also heard from Maani, whose own bribery charge was dismissed in 2023 in fulfillment of his deferred prosecution agreement. While on the witness stand, Maani acknowledged having paid bribes for nearly his entire career, which continued with the FBI’s blessing and assistance after he began cooperating with the feds in January 2018.

Maani’s cooperation led to guilty pleas from a handful of public officials involved with Maani and his businesses, including then-Sen. Martin Sandoval, D-Chicago, who received $75,000 in cash from Maani, never knowing the cash was provided by the FBI. At a dinner between the three in late June 2019, Sandoval hinted at benefits he received from Maani and told Jones that Maani “wants to be your friend.”

Maani testified that he worried Jones’ proposed legislation calling for a statewide study of red-light cameras would be a “prelude to a ban,” which would decimate his industry. Jones had refiled similar legislation for several years in a row, but the only time it got close to becoming law was in 2017 when the scope of the study was negotiated down to just the city of Chicago.

Since Maani’s company SafeSpeed operated only in the Chicago suburbs, Maani wanted Jones to limit his 2019 legislation in the same way.

After Maani agreed to both Jones’ $5,000 suggestion and the job request for his former intern at their July 2019 dinner, the senator then asked Maani, “What can I do about Chicago?”

According to the feds, that was the moment Jones agreed to the bribe.



[caption id=""attachment_64034"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1140""] FBI cooperating witness Omar Maani was a co-owner of SafeSpeed, which operated red-light camera systems in Chicago’s southwest suburbs, including at the intersection of Archer and Harlem avenues in Summit. Maani was worried that state Sen. Emil Jones III’s repeated legislative proposals for a statewide study on red-light cameras was a “prelude to a ban.”[/caption]


Job for former intern

Prosecutors also called two FBI agents who worked on the case, as well as Jones’ former intern, Christopher Katz. In the summer of 2019, Katz had just received his associate’s degree and was about to start an architecture program at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Katz told the jury he needed “some money coming in” to help pay for school and was seeking Jones’ assistance to get a part-time job.

Jones testified that he’d asked Maani for help because he’d seen dozens of college students working at SafeSpeed when he was invited to tour the company’s offices in April 2019. Though Maani initially said Katz could work as a “reviewer” of red-light camera footage, by his next meeting with Jones a few weeks later, Maani told Jones he was reticent about having SafeSpeed hire Katz.

“It looks really goofy and concerning that we’re now hiring his intern with someone who’s sponsoring negative legislation against us,” Maani testified earlier this month.

Instead, Maani floated the idea of hiring Katz to work for him directly on a research project. And a few days later, Maani called Jones to tell him that he planned to put Katz “on my payroll” even though he didn’t have much work for him to do at the time.

“I just wanted to make sure that he’s the type of kid that, you know, when he gets a check and he’s not doing anything right away, that he’s, you know, he’s not gonna be spooked by that,” Maani said on an Aug. 12, 2019, wiretapped call. “He’s not gonna be weird and stuff. … Is he — would he be cool with that for a while? I mean, does he get it? Does he understand this?”

“Yeah, but um, make sure we find him some work,” Jones replied.

Katz ended up receiving a total of $1,800 in weekly payments from Maani over the course of six weeks until the feds’ investigation — and Maani’s role in it — was made public on Sept. 24, 2019.

“The defendant knew this was not a normal job,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany Ardam said Monday, pointing out Jones had told Katz he “got the job” in mid-July even before he’d sent Katz’s resume to Maani. “What that means is the defendant knew this was part of the bribe.”

A ‘quiet’ campaign contribution

In addition to being cautious about hiring Katz at SafeSpeed, Maani also told Jones he needed to “conceal” any campaign contribution he might make, telling the senator he was wary about his colleagues growing suspicious or generating a story for the news media.

At their third and final dinner on Aug. 8, 2019, Maani asked Jones how he could contribute to the senator’s campaign without it having to be reported on public campaign finance records.

Read more: FBI mole told Sen. Emil Jones III to suggest ‘creative’ way to accept $5K lest it ‘look goofy’

Jones suggested that Maani could help sponsor a job fair in his district, mentioning sponsors often pay for food or giveaways at the events. Jones explained during his testimony that in-kind contributions like those under $150 don’t need to be reported, and claimed he was thinking that Maani would pay for some boxes of pizza or a case of bottled water, though he didn’t mention the $150 threshold during their dinner conversation.

“Okay, and there’s enough stuff for me to cover for five grand?” Maani asked?

""You don’t necessarily have to — ” Jones began to answer before Maani cut him off, telling the senator he didn’t care how it was done, so long as “everything’s kinda quiet.”

After again telling Maani that event sponsors usually just paid for food, Jones again turned the conversation to his former intern.

“I’m not really worried so much with you helping me,” Jones said. “Just help Chris out.”

Jones’ attorney Henderson on Monday pointed to that moment in closing arguments as proof Jones was attempting to dissuade Maani from giving him any money. Henderson reiterated that Jones never brought up the contribution after it dawned on him that Maani was trying to bribe him.

“Why would somebody on the take say don’t give me any money?” Henderson asked. “Why would somebody who doesn’t know their calls are being listened to say, ‘don’t give me any money?’ Why? Because he’s not on the take.”

But Ardam said Maani’s references to wanting to “conceal” the contribution were “giant red flags.”

“The defendant knew this was a bribe,” Ardam said Monday. “A bribe is a crime, and crimes need to be hidden.”

Alleged lies to FBI

But when a pair of FBI agents knocked on Jones’ door the morning of Sept. 24, 2019, Jones denied having discussed with Maani how a campaign contribution could be made without having it publicly reported.

That was one of three specific lies the feds allege the senator told during the interview, which was secretly recorded. The agents told Jones they were investigating Sandoval, who later died after pleading guilty, but did not reveal they were also investigating Jones.

When Special Agent Timothy O’Brien asked whether he and Maani came up with an amount Maani was going to donate, Jones said, “no, no no.”

Kolluri on Monday told the jury that Jones’ response to that question “was intentional.”

“He knew he’d broken the law,"" the prosecutor said. “You’ve heard the recording of that interview and you know he was not truthful.”

In the interview, Jones also denied knowing that Katz was getting paid, despite he and Maani agreeing that $15 an hour was fair at their last dinner six weeks prior.

The feds also say Jones lied about his promise to “protect” Maani and SafeSpeed from then-state Rep. David McSweeney, R-Barrington Hills, a friend of Jones’ who was also in favor of legislation to study red-light cameras but only because he wanted to see the industry abolished in Illinois.

Kolluri on Monday told the jury the FBI agents were just two of the people or circumstances Jones blamed for landing him in court.

“Not once did he take any accountability for any of this or express any regret,” the prosecutor said. “But most importantly, he lied to you.”

Kolluri said that in addition to lying to the FBI, Jones lied on the witness stand.

“He had an answer for almost everything, the same thing he said Omar Maani did,” Kolluri said, hearkening back to Jones’ description of Maani in testimony last week. “But the problem with lying is it always catches up to you.”

Photograph by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout ©2025Hecklers interrupted a speech Thursday by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. at a conference on opioid addiction in Nashville.
The Rx and Illicit Drug Summit 2025 drew law enforcement officials, addiction prevention counselors, social workers and public health officers to the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center for the three-day event.
For years, Kennedy has drawn ire and disapproval for his anti-vaccine messages and, more recently, for belittling comments about people with autism and budget cuts in his department.
“Believe science!” shouted a protester before security rushed him from the room. Another protester held aloft a sign that read, “Vaccines save lives.”
Kennedy’s speech was apolitical and focused on his own history in recovery from an addiction to heroin and his recommendations for dealing with the nation’s opioid crisis — many of which focused less on medical or treatment solutions and more on the need to build community, embrace spirituality and take personal responsibility.
After touting a $4 billion budget at HHS, Kennedy said that “money alone won’t fix this.”
“We have a whole generation of children who have lost faith in our country and their future,” Kennedy said. “Policy should reestablish hope for the future.”
Alexis Pleus of Binghamton, New York, and another woman unfurled a banner saying “Cuts Kill” before being ejected.
Pleus, who came to Nashville with other members of a group called Moms United to End the War on Drugs, lost her son to a drug overdose and said budget cuts at HHS spurred her attendance.

The Trump administration — and Kennedy — have proposed to restructure HHS, including dismantling the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), cutting research funding and funding for addiction treatment and mental health care.
“All these changes are impacting people on the ground,” Pleus said. “People who are struggling with addiction can’t get help already and now they’re going to have an even harder time.”
The conference was sponsored by HMP Global, which provides continuing medical education.
Past speakers have included former Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. President Donald Trump spoke to the group in 2019 during his first term in office.
In addition to Kennedy, 2025 speakers included U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Tennessee senior U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn and Dr. Ralph Alvarado, commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Health.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Researchers at the University of Utah recently published a first-of-its-kind study that measures the impact dust has on melting snow in the Colorado River Basin.
Dust has long been credited to accelerating snowmelt in the Intermountain West. Blowing from arid regions and settling in the mountains, the dust darkens the snow, lowering its albedo — essentially, darker snow doesn’t reflect the sunlight as well, leading to more heat absorption and speeding up the melting process.
It’s particularly prevalent in the Colorado River Basin, with large mountain ranges like the San Juans, La Sals and Maroon Bells pushed up against dry expanses of desert. As drought continues to impact the region, dust events have worsened, depleting the snowpack at faster rates and complicating an already precarious situation for the Colorado River and the 40 million people who get their drinking water from it.
And while previous papers have recorded the impact dust has on snowmelt, University of Utah researchers are the first to study an area as large as the Colorado River headwaters, which spans multiple states. According to the university, there are no snowmelt models — streamflow forecasts in mountain basins essential for areas that rely on snowpack for water — that take dust into account.
“The degree of darkening caused by dust has been related to water forecasting errors. The water comes earlier than expected, and this can have real world impacts — for example if the ground is still frozen it’s too early for farmers to use. A reservoir manager can store early snowmelt, but they need the information to plan for that,” said McKenzie Skiles, associate professor at the university’s School of Environment, Society and Sustainability. “If we can start to build dust into the snowmelt forecast models, it will make water management decision-making more informed.”
Stiles is a co-lead author of the study, which was published in the scientific journal Geophysical Research Letters in March.
Stiles and other researchers analyzed 23 years of satellite images, from 2021 to 2023, to observe snow darkened by dust in the spring months. They found that dust accelerated snowmelt in the Colorado River Basin every spring, even during less-dusty years.
During runoff season, typically between April and May, the snowpack melts about 10 to 15 millimeters each day. According to the study, dust deposition can accelerate snowmelt by 1 millimeter per hour during peak sunlight — during a “high-dust” year, that can factor out to about 10 extra millimeters each day.
“It’s not just how much dust gets deposited over a season, but also the timing of dust deposition that matters,” said Patrick Naple, doctoral candidate of geography at the University of Utah and lead author of the study. “Dust is very effective at speeding up melt because it’s most frequently deposited in the spring when days are getting longer and the sun more intense. Even an extra millimeter per hour can make the snowpack disappear several weeks earlier than without dust deposition.”
One of the most comprehensive analyses of dust and snowmelt yet, the university says this research could improve water forecasting and allocation for communities that rely on the Colorado River.

The bill (HB 317), sponsored by Miami-Dade Republican Tom Fabricio, has bitterly divided law enforcement in Florida. The Florida Sheriffs Association and the Florida Police Chiefs Association have both came out in opposition to  the bill. But the Florida Fraternal Order of Police and Florida Police Benevolent Association support it.
In committee meetings and again on the House floor on Thursday, Fabricio emphasized that his bill does not preclude individuals from making an anonymous complaint. However, the bill says that before any interrogations of the accused officer are to commence, that officer must be informed about the identity of the individual making the complaint.
Several House Democrats expressed concerns about the legislation.
“This bill builds walls around misconduct and discourages good officers and community members from speaking up,” said Broward County Rep. Daryl Campbell. “Under this bill, no officer can be investigated unless they receive a copy of a signed, sworn complaint. That sounds reasonable, until you remember how rare it is for whistleblowers, whether it’s civilians or fellow officers, to feel safe on the record, especially when it’s about someone within their own department.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXOrlando Democratic Rep. LaVon Bracy Davis said, “False accusations are serious, but so is unchecked power.”
“This bill doesn’t protect justice, it protects silence,” she continued, adding that the Legislature last year passed measures severely restricting civilian review boards and enabling police, firefighters, and and paramedics to establish 25-foot no-go-zones around themselves while working.
“The Florida Police Chiefs Association and the Sheriffs Association both oppose this bill — that should tell us something,” said Bracy Davis. “I don’t just legislate for Tallahassee, I legislate through the lens of my district, a district representing all people, inclusive of of black, brown, and yes, blue lives. Let me clear: I back the blue, wholeheartedly, but I also back the Black and the brown.”
But Hillsborough County Republican Rep. Danny Alvarez, who in his job outside of the Legislature serves as general counsel for the Tampa Police Benevolent Association, blasted some of the Democrats’ remarks.
“At some point, you have to stop attacking the 99.8 [percent] and start supporting them,” he said. “At some point, you have to realize that the rhetoric that is absolutely anti-cop in this chamber has to be checked by your desire to have a safe and secure society with an accountability process that exists today. Cops are one of the most regulated people you have ever seen, and if you don’t believe that, go be one.”
The House passed the measure, 93-16, with several Democrats joining Republicans.
However, the Senate bill (SB 516), sponsored by Hillsborough County Republican Jay Collins, was never heard in any committee of that chamber, meaning the measure is effectively dead for this session.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Legislators authorized a few court closures Thursday while approving the biennial court officers bill. It’s the first time lawmakers are eliminating judges that are underutilized.
“Statewide, we have the right number of judicial officers,” said Fishers Republican Rep. Chris Jeter. “The question is, are they in the right places?”
Two weeks ago, the Senate added language taking away judges in 11 mostly rural counties. But the conference committee report — approved 83-5 in the House and 45-4 in the Senate — eliminates only one court in Blackford County, one court in Monroe County and one magistrate in Jennings County.
It also removes several unfilled magistrate positions in Marion County.
House Bill 1144 — which adds judges and magistrates in Elkhart, Hamilton, Lawrence and Vigo counties — had moved through the entire session without language abolishing courts.
Then, on April 10, hours before a committee deadline, an amendment was added in the Senate Appropriations Committee eliminating one court each in Blackford, Carroll, Gibson, Greene, Jennings, Monroe, Newton, Owen, Pulaski, Rush and Scott counties, along with six juvenile magistrate positions in Marion County.
State panel recommends judicial reallocation from low- to high-need counties

This provision was estimated to save the state approximately $748,885 in Fiscal Year 2027 and up to $2.75 M in Fiscal Year 2032, according to a fiscal analysis.
Lawmakers from those areas were deluged with concern from constituents.
The general idea of reallocation was discussed in a study committee in October 2024. Essentially, Indiana uses a weighted caseload study that assesses how much judicial time is needed for different types of cases. Then it looks at how many cases are filed to determine how many judges and magistrates are needed for the caseload.
For years, lawmakers have added state-funded court officers when the statistics have shown more judges are needed to handle additional cases. But as population has shifted away from some rural counties, they have never taken a judge away — even if the weighted caseload shows they have too many court officers.
The weighted caseload study shows, for instance, that Monroe County has 10 judges but only needs 7.87. Blackford County has two judges, but the study shows it needs less than one.
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, said “these are never easy decisions” but that population shifts mean some counties aren’t seeing as much crime or as many lawsuits.
Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, said he doesn’t disagree with the premise but said the process should have been set out well in advance. He noted the House never heard testimony on eliminating judges.
He said Monroe County is losing a court because one of the judges announced she is retiring.
Sen. Ron Alting, R-Lafayette, thanked his colleagues for giving the Carroll County courts a reprieve. He said the Delphi double-murder case “really upset” the court system there.

House Bill 267, known as “Bobby’s Law,” has passed both chambers and been sent to Gov. Greg Gianforte, who is widely expected to sign it. 
The bill, carried by Rep. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls, establishes the crime of aggravated vehicular homicide while under the influence. A conviction would mandate a three-year minimum prison sentence, a minimum fine of $10,000 and prevents a judge from delaying or suspending the sentence. 
“This bill sends a clear message: If you kill someone in this state while driving, and you’re extremely impaired, that you will finally face real justice,” Mitchell said during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last month. 
A recent Forbes rating of the worst states for drunk driving, based on the percent of traffic deaths caused by drunk drivers, ranked Montana No. 1, with 8.57 DUI-related fatalities per 100,000 drivers. 
Data from the Montana Department of Transportation shows that during the last decade, between 33% and 45% of all car crash fatalities in the state involve alcohol impairment, with Yellowstone, Big Horn, Missoula and Flathead Counties having the highest percentage of roadway fatalities involving alcohol. 
But beyond the data, the bill was personal for Mitchell, who was friends and neighbors with Bobby Dewbre, who was killed by a drunk driver in 2023. 
“The worst part of all this is that the person who killed him barely faced any consequences,” Mitchell said. “…I’ve worked with Bobby Dewbre’s family to craft a law to seek justice for other families who may face this horrific experience.”
More than 80 people testified in favor of the bill during its hearing before the House committee, and dozens showed up again to testify in the Senate.
Elizabeth McBride, Dewbre’s mother, and other members of his family testified about getting the call about her son’s death and what her family and community went through when the driver was charged with two misdemeanors. 
“We’re not suggesting that people stop drinking, but we are imploring you to send the clear message that getting drunk and then getting behind the wheel will not be tolerated,” McBride said. “…Drunk driving is a choice. It is not legal, and it is 100% avoidable.”
McBride helped found a nonprofit called Montana Bar Fairies, dedicated to “change the drinking and driving culture in Montana.” The organization, which has chapters in four counties, strongly advocated for Bobby’s law and works with local communities and bars to boost DUI awareness. 
One part of the group’s outreach involves sending out volunteers every weekend to leave $5 gift cards to local coffee shops on cars left in bar parking lots overnight, a small incentive they hope builds big results. 
Patricia Hinchey, director of the Bozeman chapter of Montana Bar Fairies, said that growing up in the state, she always had an earlier curfew than her friends due to the high number of impaired drivers on the road. 
“As I’ve gotten older, I’ve come to realize how unsafe Montana’s roadways are. Driving should not be something that makes me so fearful, but I’m scared to drive, not just at night, but at any time of the day,” Hinchey said. “This needs to change.”
The law, Mitchell said, fixes a gap in the legal system and increases accountability for individuals who make the choice to drive under the influence.
“We’ve heard from the Department of Transportation, law enforcement agencies, police groups, from county attorneys, bar owners, business owners and just average everyday residents across the state,” he said. The new law will show that “our state is finally committed to reducing these incidents and making roads safer for all residents and visitors.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-1290950900-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 20:04:58.549812

(Photo courtesy of New Mexico Aging Services)As New Mexico’s population of seniors continues to grow, the state’s aging department is proposing expanded initiatives to help seniors maintain their autonomy while also supporting family caregivers.
The New Mexico Aging and Long-Term Services Department released a draft of its 2025-2029 State Plan on Aging on Thursday and is receiving feedback from the public and stakeholders through May 15. The document states that it is expected to go into effect in October 2025.
The plan details three goals to help New Mexicans age in place and reduce instances of abuse and neglect, including: administering programs to support seniors aging in their own homes, as well as their caregivers; responding to “social determinants of health,” such as food security, housing security and access to healthcare; and reducing instances of abuse, neglect and exploitation in the state while also preserving seniors’ autonomy.
According to the previous plan, more than 377,700 New Mexicans were 65 and older in 2018. This number grew to more than 391,200 in 2020 and is projected to grow by 122% by 2030, meaning more than 475,600 New Mexicans will be 65 and over. The current draft plan states that New Mexico is currently the 13th state in the U.S. with the highest percentage of population falling into this age category.
“In the past five years a lot has changed including the growth of our aging population and increased needs such as transportation access and caregiver support,” an unattributed written statement from the aging department to Source NM reads. “The new plan strives to address these changing needs including standing up new programs like New MexiCare that support family and friend caregivers.”
The New MexiCare program provides caregivers with financial and training support to then help aging New Mexicans remain in their own homes. The program is currently available in 31 of the state’s 33 counties, excepting Doña Ana and Bernalillo counties, but aging department representatives have said previously the goal is to eventually expand the program into those counties as well.
The department also noted in its statement that only an estimated 22% of the 60 and older population receive services such as home-delivered meals, congregate meals, transportation, case management, adult day care, respite services and homemaker services – all of which fall under the Older Americans Act Title III services and are provided by the Area Agencies on Aging in the state. 
“The advocacy responsibilities remain a quintessential aspect of the work that ALTSD engages in daily,” the statement reads.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)FAMU has named four finalists for president, with a final vote scheduled next month. How the search committee developed its list is under question, however, with some trustees saying there are “clouds hanging” over the process.
Under Florida law, presidential search committees, comprising university trustees, stakeholders, and a university system Board of Governors (BOG) member, work on a confidential search before presenting a list of finalists to the public and trustees.
FAMU trustees questioned Thursday whether to investigate the legality of the search so far. 
“Certainly, there may be a rumor mill,” FAMU Board of Trustees Chair Kristin Harper said during a virtual meeting Thursday, adding the board has an obligation to address those rumors. 
FAMU released its list of finalists Tuesday. the Tallahassee Democrat published the names on Monday. Harper questioned how the names of finalists were released to the newspaper before the university formally announced them, considering the nondisclosure agreement signed by the members of the committee. 
Harper called it “grossly unfair” that the names were released before the university announced them.
The list has four finalists, including University of Maryland Eastern Shore Provost Rondall Allen, University of Central Florida VP for Administration and Finance Gerald Hector, FAMU Chief Operating Officer Donald Palm, and former Florida Board of Education Chair Marva Johnson. 
The Democrat reported: “There has been wide speculation that [search committee chair Deveron] Gibbons insisted on adding Johnson” to an already existing list of three finalists. 
The Board of Governors is requesting information related to the search, according to FAMU trustees, although that request is not part of a formal investigation and does not pause the search, they said. The Phoenix did not receive a response to a Thursday request for comment from the BOG. 
The scope of the BOG request for information was unknown Thursday.

Pause or not?
Trustees debated whether it would be proper for FAMU to conduct its own investigation and pause the search before final interviews and a vote is taken during the week of May 12. 
“There are too many clouds hanging over this process,” trustee Earnie Ellison said. He served on the Florida Atlantic University Board of Trustees when that university suspended a presidential search due to ethics concerns.
“We are not just potted plants,” FAMU Trustee Belvin Perry Jr., a former judge, said, adding that the board has its own fiduciary duty. 
Gibbons insisted FAMU “has conducted a transparent, inclusive process.”
“This is almost laughable. We have run a very clean process,” Gibbons said, objecting to a pause on the search. 
“We are being reactionary to a group of people who are hurling around rumors and innuendo,” Gibbons said, decrying a “witch-hunt.”
Eight trustees voted against pausing the search to hire an independent consultant to investigate the process, while five supported doing so.
From outside the process, Leon County Commissioner Bill Proctor, a political science instructor at FAMU, has called one finalist “weak” but did not specify which one, the Democrat reported. Proctor said “the public now believes the process of a search is a farce,” and called on trustees to “peer through the haze of this Hanky Panky Express and restart the search process.”
The search began after former President Larry Robinson stepped down after announcing a $237 million gift that was later found to be fraudulent. 
While lawmakers at the Capitol struggle to reach an agreement on a state budget, Trustee Kelvin Lawson said FAMU is “on thin ice” as lawmakers decide how much money the school will receive next fiscal year. 
“I don’t think we have enough facts or precedent to stop or slow this process,” Lawson said.
Presidential search tension
Presidential searches have been a major topic of discussion in the Florida Capitol this session, with the House passing a bill with broad support that would eliminate the confidentiality of presidential searches and end BOG involvement.
Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has worked to install political allies as presidents of public universities, said he will veto the bill if it gets to his desk.
Johnson was appointed to the Florida Board of Education by former Gov. Rick Scott and was appointed by DeSantis to serve on the Florida Scholar’s Academy Board of Trustees. That’s an education program for juvenile offenders.

Los Angeles pediatrician and urgent care specialist Dr. Ilan Shapiro worries for his chronically ill patients as he watches Congress weigh significant cuts to Medicaid.
He thinks of a boy who, before finding Shapiro’s clinic, was in and out of emergency rooms and intensive care units because of severe asthma attacks, instead of competing in soccer games and studying for exams. The boy’s parents were losing hours and pay at work with the frequent ER visits.
Shapiro, who is Latino, works at a federally qualified health care center, a clinic for low-income patients. Most of his patients are people of color on Medicaid, and roughly a quarter of them are children.

Research shows Latino and Black family physicians are more likely to see Medicaid patients compared with their white and Asian counterparts. Experts say the Medicaid cuts Congress is weighing would strap health care centers that rely on already-low Medicaid reimbursements, disproportionately affecting communities of color and the physicians they rely on.











It's not just health insurance. It's a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.


– Dr. Ilan Shapiro



Of the 72 million people covered by Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities, more than half are people of color, with Black and Hispanic people disproportionately represented on the rolls.
Black and Hispanic patients have a higher risk of conditions such as high blood pressure, kidney disease and certain cancers, making health care access crucial.
Congressional Republicans are considering $880 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid spending to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. Conservatives have long argued that Medicaid is too expensive. They assert its expansion under the Affordable Care Act to more working adults has diverted too much money toward nondisabled people, taking resources away from vulnerable populations the program was originally intended to help.
But clinicians and policy analysts say the federal Medicaid cuts could have an especially detrimental impact on vulnerable enrollees, including children, older adults and people with disabilities or chronic illnesses, as states are forced to find savings to fill the gap.

One GOP proposal targeting Medicaid expansion could lead to reductions in children’s health insurance programs, according to a February report by the Urban Institute. The think tank estimates that proposed cuts to federal Medicaid expansion spending could increase the number of uninsured kids by 11.8%.
“I’m deeply afraid,” said Shapiro. “It’s not just health insurance. It’s a lifeline for the entire family that could be severely impacted.”

Bias and language barriers

Just 6% of U.S. physicians are Latino and 5% are Black, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Sustaining the relatively few medical practices with Black and Hispanic providers is important amid evidence that racial bias, lack of access to culturally competent care and language barriers lead to poorer health outcomes or access.
For example, analyses have shown Black patients are less likely to be prescribed pain medication, and some clinicians hold false ideas that Black patients have a higher pain tolerance. Nearly 1 in 3 Black, Hispanic and multiracial women reported mistreatment in medical settings during pregnancy and delivery, such as receiving no help when asking for it or being shouted at, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study.
Language barriers, which Latino communities are more likely to face, are also associated with poorer health or limited access to health care.

“We understand the language and cultural concordance and the improved outcomes,” said Dr. Linda Mirdamadi, an adjunct clinical assistant professor at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine who serves on the National Hispanic Medical Association’s board of directors. “There’s a sense of trust.”
Mirdamadi said federal cuts to Medicaid would lead to loss of preventive care for her large, diverse community.
“If they don’t have access to health care, they’re not going to have the access to chronic disease prevention, to vaccines, to cancer prevention screening,” she said. “It is going to just increase the disparity gaps that already exist.”

‘Ripple effect’

Dr. Roger Mitchell, president-elect of the National Medical Association, which represents Black physicians, said a widespread loss of Medicaid coverage would affect everybody, even people with private insurance. People without health coverage often don’t have primary doctors and forgo preventive care, resulting in more trips to the emergency room. That can lead to longer wait times at ERs for everyone, regardless of their health insurance.
Mitchell also pointed out that Medicaid reimbursements are a major funding stream for hospitals and clinics that see a lot of enrollees. Without that money, many of those providers might be forced to scale back their services or close.
“The ripple effect is enormous,” said Mitchell, who heads Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C., where about 40% of patients are covered by Medicaid. “This is an issue that’s not just affecting one portion of the U.S. populace, but all of us, and has the potential to have huge harm.”

Dr. Zita Magloire is a family physician, but she also offers obstetric care along with two OB-GYNs at Cairo Medical Care in the south Georgia city of Cairo. The city is the county seat of Grady County, which has about 26,000 residents, almost 30% of whom are Black.
Her practice is one of the few in the area that takes Medicaid for obstetric care, she noted, and serves many Central American immigrant patients who drive from the surrounding rural areas to her clinic. When another practice in the area started cutting services, her center absorbed those patients.
“There’s not a lot of providers that accept Medicaid,” she said. “What does that look like? Well, they [patients] show up with no prenatal care — and then, you have very high-risk patients.”
Back in Los Angeles, the boy whose family found Shapiro’s clinic is now a teenager. He received stable asthma care there and got Medicaid coverage.
“He started having a medical home. Everything changed. The ER visits and the intensive care unit visits changed to soccer games,” Shapiro said. Having coverage, he continued, “makes a huge impact for the entire community.”

Free.,Trump DOJ asks U.S. Supreme Court to reverse ruling allowing transgender troops,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-doj-asks-us-supreme-court-reverse-ruling-allowing-transgender-troops,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court Thursday to block a lower court’s decision allowing transgender individuals to continue enlisting and serving in the armed forces.Administration officials are seeking a stay of a broad district court ruling in late March that applied to all troops rather than only to those who challenged President Donald Trump’s executive order in court. The U.S. Appeals Court for the 9th Circuit upheld the lower court’s ruling Friday.The government contends its policy does not discriminate against an entire class of people, but rather finds a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria to be disqualifying. Gender dysphoria is recognized by medical professionals as distress caused by an incongruence between a person’s gender identity and their sex at birth.In its application to the Supreme Court Thursday afternoon, the Department of Justice argued it’s likely to succeed in the case because the newly adopted policy does not differ widely from those in place under former secretaries of defense.“The policy was based in part on the findings of a panel of experts convened during the first Trump Administration, which found that service by individuals with gender dysphoria was contrary to ‘military effectiveness and lethality,’” wrote John Sauer, Trump’s solicitor general.Sauer also argued the district court’s universal order violated the power of the president.Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 27, asserting the “adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.” Further, the order said that being transgender is “not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.”Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued the new policy a month later, reversing former President Joe Biden’s order allowing service members to transition and serve openly under their preferred gender identity.Trump’s order immediately drew court challenges, including a separate case now in the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia.A Department of Justice attorney arguing before the D.C. Circuit Tuesday alerted the judges that the administration would “imminently” appeal the 9th Circuit decision to the Supreme Court.Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Foundation, who are representing plaintiffs in the 9th Circuit case, released a statement in response Tuesday asserting, “Transgender service members have been openly serving our country with honor and distinction for almost a decade and have met and are meeting every neutral service-based standard.”“The U.S. Supreme Court should reject the invitation to stay the district court’s injunction so that they can impose their discriminatory ban while the litigation proceeds,” the statement said.The administration’s emergency application to the high court Thursday is just the latest in the administration’s whack-a-mole battle against lower federal court rulings that have blocked White House actions, particularly on immigration.",,,,2025-04-24 19:06:59.387921

The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.

Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.
Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units, and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)With Utah facing a drier year, Gov. Spencer Cox issued an executive order declaring a state of emergency in 17 counties due to drought conditions. 
The counties covered by the order include southern and rural areas of Washington, Iron, San Juan, Kane, Juab, Emery, Grand, Beaver, Garfield, Piute, Millard, Tooele, Uintah, Carbon, Sevier, Sanpete and Wayne counties. 
The governor’s executive order comes after the Drought Response Committee recently recommended he act due to drought conditions. 
“We’ve been monitoring drought conditions closely, and unfortunately, our streamflow forecasts are low, particularly in southern Utah,” Cox said in a prepared statement. “I urge all Utahns to be extremely mindful of their water use and find every possible way to conserve. Water conservation is critical for Utah’s future.”
Cox’s emergency declaration also comes after he told reporters last week he was working on issuing one due to worsening drought conditions in southern Utah, which has seen a weak snowpack this winter. 
Cox considers emergency declaration as drought worsens in southern Utah and Lake Powell levels drop

Though the governor said last week it’s been a “pretty normal year for most of the state,” there are some areas that are worse off than others. 
Currently, severe drought covers 42% of the state, and 4% is in extreme drought, according to the state’s website. 
This year, Utah’s snowpack peaked at 14.3 inches on March 23, which is equal to the state’s typical annual peak, according to state officials. However, southwestern Utah’s snowpack was only about 44% of normal. Plus, winter temperatures were 2 degrees Fahrenheit higher than normal. 
The state’s reservoir storage levels are at 84% of capacity, “which will help the state weather drought,” the governor’s office said in a news release. “However, drought is unpredictable, and taking proactive measures to prepare is critical.”
Cox’s order reflects the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s disaster classifications, which are informed by the U.S. Drought Monitor and NRCS’s water supply report.
“The state partners closely with federal agencies to share critical water supply and drought updates,” Joel Ferry, executive director for the Utah Department of Natural Resources, said in a  statement. “Proactive planning is essential. We ask all Utahns across all sectors to use less water to help stretch the water supply.”
It’s been almost exactly three years since the governor declared a drought declaration. The last time he did so was April 22, 2022, when 65% of the state was in extreme drought, and more than 99% of the state was experiencing at least severe drought conditions. 
As part of his order, Cox urged Utahns to watch their water use, both inside and outside their homes. 
Water-saving tips listed by SlowTheFlow.org include: 

Wait to water your lawn until temperatures are in the mid-70s for several consecutive days, and check the Weekly Lawn Watering Guide for other tips on how to optimize water use.
Fix leaks.
Run full loads for dishwashers and washing machines.
Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth, shaving, soaping up, doing dishes or rinsing vegetables.
Shorten your shower time by at least one minute.
Participate in water-saving programs like water-smart landscaping, toilet replacement, and smart sprinkler controllers.

(Canva image)Gov. Jeff Landry is backing a law change that would allow an appointed director of the Louisiana Racing Commission to continue owning racehorses, even though the director oversees their licensing as part of his government job. 
The proposed exception is included in House Bill 397, a sweeping piece of legislation that would also make dozens of changes to Louisiana’s ethics code for elected officials and public employees. 
Stephen Landry became the commission’s top staffer in 2024 after the governor appointed new members to its board. At the time, Stephen Landry, who is not related to the governor, had a partial ownership stake in two racehorses. 
Stephen Landry did not return a call made to his office Thursday. 
The commission is responsible for regulating horse racing and betting in Louisiana. It issues licenses to racetracks, training centers, off-track betting operations and racehorse owners like Stephen Landry. 
Commissioners can also suspend and withdraw racehorse owners’ licenses it previously granted.

The Louisiana Board of Ethics told Stephen Landry last year in an advisory opinion that state law is “silent” on whether he can own racehorses while serving as the commission’s executive director.  
State employees are prohibited from doing business with the agencies where they work, however. Using that logic, the ethics board told Stephen Landry he would not be able to apply for a racehorse owner’s license when he needs a renewal in 2026 if he still serves as the commission’s executive director. 
The change the governor is pushing would remove that barrier for Stephen Landry. 

Landry proactively sought the ethics board’s opinion about his horse ownership after the Paulick Report, a horse racing news outlet, raised concerns about him taking the commission director’s job.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

“How’s he supposed to investigate and recommend to his commissioners potential changes to the state’s breeders’ incentive program objectively?” editor-in-chief Natalie Voss wrote about Stephen Landry in a 2024 commentary. “What’s he going to do if he’s alerted [a co-owner of his horse] has a possible rule violation being investigated by the staff? How would he deal with an appeal of a disqualification coming from one of his active (or recent) ownership partners?” 

“The Association of Racing Commissioners International model rules expressly prohibit this, both for employees of a commission (like the executive director) or for employees under the executive director,” Voss added.
The racing commission’s chairman, Ed Koehl, told Stephen Landry when he took the executive director position that he could own horses without any fear of conflict, Stephen Landry’s attorney, Dane Ciolino, wrote in a letter to the ethics board. 
The commission, and not the executive director, votes on whether to grant or withdraw an ownership license, Ciolino said. 
Under a law approved last year, all 13 state racing commissioners who decide on ownership licensing can own racehorses that compete in Louisiana. Previously, only three of the 13 commissioners were allowed to own racehorses.

This year’s ethics bill, sponsored by Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R- New Iberia, reiterates that Louisiana Racing Commission members, in addition to the executive director, can own horses that race in Louisiana. 

Beaullieu’s proposal cleared its first legislative hurdle Wednesday when it passed the Louisiana House and Governmental Affairs Committee.

(Photo by Leah Romero / Source NM)People interested in becoming a caregiver for older adults or people with disabilities in New Mexico will face more strict requirements under a new state law but now have a way of appealing if they get rejected.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on April 7 signed House Bill 131, which enhances background check requirements for caregivers, expanding the list of disqualifying criminal offenses.
At the same time, HB 131 creates an easier pathway for those who qualify for the job, which sponsors hope will help expand the workforce.
Starting July 1, anyone convicted of battery of a household member, animal cruelty, identity theft, human trafficking or assault of a peace officer can be found to pose an “unreasonable risk” as a caregiver. The new law also allows the Health Care Authority to write rules to add more crimes to the list.
The law already prohibited someone from becoming a caregiver if they had been convicted of homicide; drug trafficking; kidnapping; rape or other sexual offenses; abuse of adults or children; robbery; larceny; burglary; fraud; financial exploitation or embezzlement.
“This law reflects our commitment to protecting the safety and dignity of the New Mexicans who rely on caregiving services,” New Mexico Health Care Authority Secretary Kari Armijo said in a statement. “By strengthening background checks, we are creating safer environments for vulnerable individuals and providing families with greater peace of mind.” 
Two of the bill’s co-sponsors in the Legislature told Source NM it is intended to decrease how long it takes to appeal a background check finding, and make the appeals process more effective, after providers gave feedback about it taking too long, which led to applicants giving up and working elsewhere like in the service industry.
Co-sponsor Rep. Elizabeth Thomson (D-Albuquerque), chair of the House Health and Human Services Committee, told Source NM that the bill will help people with disabilities because more people will be able to apply for jobs to care for them. She said there is very high staff turnover at groups homes, nursing homes and other care facilities, and it’s difficult to find replacements because caregiving is a demanding job that pays very little.
“These jobs have a lot of responsibility, I mean, this is someone’s mother, or grandmother or son that you’re taking care of,” Thomson said. “It can be a very stressful, very physically challenging job, and sometimes downright scary.”
For example, Thomson said she sees new staff working at the group home that houses her own son who is very tall, strong and has severe autism that can result in him engaging in difficult behaviors like smearing his own feces on the walls, ceilings and his own clothing.
Co-sponsor Rep. Kathleen Cates (D-Rio Rancho) told Source NM the bill fits into the legislative session’s broader focus on public safety by protecting the most vulnerable people, including those with disabilities.
Cates said the Health Care Authority’s Division of Health Improvement asked her to carry the bill. The division runs the state’s caregiver background check registry.
“These direct care providers are extraordinarily important in our community, especially now as our community is aging at a higher ratio, and we do not pay them a professional wage,” Cates said.
HB131 does not impact caregivers’ pay, but Cates and Thomson say they want to pursue future pieces of legislation to raise their compensation. In 2023, they co-sponsored a law that requires the state to conduct a cost study every two years for caregivers for people with developmental disabilities.
But as soon as the study’s findings are implemented, the pay rates are already two years behind inflation, Thomson said.
“Even before I started as a representative, I was an advocate for people with disabilities and even back then in the 1990s, we were saying, ‘You’re not paying these people enough,’” Thomson said. “I don’t know what the magic number is; I haven’t found it.”

At least 14 states have passed laws that restrict students’ use of smartphones in schools. Vermont lawmakers are debating whether to follow suit.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Should Vermont ban cellphones from schools?.","Student’s cell phones sit in baskets after they were turned in at the start of the school day in Rio de Janeiro, Wednesday, Feb. 5, on the first day of a national ban that restricts the use of smartphones in elementary and high schools. (AP Photo/Bruna Prado)Ask almost any educator in the country and they’ll tell you: the phones are getting out of hand. “It’s a topic of interest just about anywhere,” Mike McRaith, associate executive director of the Vermont Principals Association, told members of the House Committee on Education last week. “Generally speaking, there’s a more universal understanding that there’s a real risk with digital addiction.” Growing concerns about the emotional and cognitive impacts of chronic smartphone and social media use among children have led to a nationwide movement to ban personal devices in classrooms. Already 14 states have implemented some form of a smartphone ban in schools, with eight more recommending that school boards adopt a policy. The legislatures of 23 other states, including Vermont, are actively weighing whether to follow suit. Also, many countries have put in place different versions of a nationwide school cellphone ban, including in Europe, and, recently, Brazil.In Montpelier, lawmakers are considering H.54, a bill that would require school districts and independent schools to develop and adopt policies prohibiting students from using personal electronic devices, including cellphones and smartwatches, during the school day (the legislation includes exceptions for students who need certain accommodations). As introduced, the bill would also ban schools from using social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram to communicate with students, aiming to discourage the integration of social media into education at all.“I’m in full favor of a bell-to-bell ban,” Rep. Casey Toof, R-St. Albans Town, told fellow committee members Thursday. “I think this is something that’s really important.”The bill doesn’t dictate how schools would implement the prohibition. Some Vermont schools like Harwood Union Middle and High School have already adopted policies requiring students to place their phones in lockable pouches each morning. But advocates of the bill have also pointed to more cost effective methods for collecting and storing smartphones, like using manila folders or bins.“I’m very mindful of the burden of the expense of storage, and that concerns me to some degree,” Rep.

LINCOLN — A bill to reduce contributions to a state teachers retirement plan advanced toward final passage on Thursday despite a stern warning from a former Nebraska lawmaker who once guided state retirement plan policies.
The measure, Legislative Bill 645, is designed to help close the state’s projected $457 million budget deficit over two years by reducing the state’s contributions into teacher retirement plans by about $77 million, thus freeing up that money to help close the budget gap.
Former State Sen. Mark Kolterman, who headed the Legislature’s Retirement Systems Committee for seven years, said that using retirement plan funds to balance the budget doesn’t make financial sense, particularly when it’s uncertain if investments will garner enough revenue to maintain retirement funds.
“You don’t make reductions in contributions when the economy is moving in the wrong direction,” Kolterman said, noting the recent stock “market tumble.”


Turmoil at state retirement systems?
A member of the Nebraska Public Employees Retirement Systems Board resigned earlier this week after Gov. Jim Pillen rejected the “best candidate” to head the agency that oversees state and school retirement plans.
Allen Simpson of Lincoln, a long-time PERB member, had headed the board’s personnel committee, which had recommended the hiring of the current interim director/deputy director of the agency, Tyler Cummings, to fill the vacancy left when former State Treasurer and State Sen. John Murante resigned in December.
“They’re not going to get a better candidate than Tyler Cummings,” said Simpson on Thursday.
Simpson said he resigned from the board on Monday feeling that if the governor did not agree with his committees’ pick, “you probably shouldn’t stay on.”
“I’m trying to say this in the most politically correct way possible,” said Simpson, who, like Pillen, is a Republican.
Pillen’s office did not respond immediately to a request for comment Thursday afternoon.
The search for a new director reportedly has been reopened. The job paid $205,000-a-year.
On Thursday, State Sen. Danielle Conrad said that the “uncertainty” with the director’s job and the vacancy on the PERB board has made it more difficult to decide the best policies when it comes to state retirement plans.


Letter outlines objections
Advocates of LB 645, including Lincoln Sen. Beau Ballard, the current chair of the Retirement Committee, dismissed the concern, maintaining that the state can safely lower its contributions to the school retirement plan because that plan is currently nearly 100% funded, and is taking in more contributions — from teachers, local school districts and the state — than needed.
Ballard has called the bill a “win” for the state budget and for teachers, because they will see about $1,000 a year in additional take-home pay by reducing their contributions via the proposal.
  State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln. July 25, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Kolterman commented after the state lawmakers, on a voice vote, advanced LB 645 to the final stage of debate. Prior to Thursday’s debate on the bill, the former senator sent a letter — obtained by the Nebraska Examiner — to the members of the Retirement Committee outlining his objections.
In the letter, Kolterman said that major changes in the state’s retirement plan contributions are usually not made so hastily, because if a pension plan becomes underfunded, the state has to make up the difference.
“Any changes to retirement benefits in any of the retirement plans must be approached with great caution, study, and examination of the actuarially calculated costs,” he wrote. LB 645, he said, was “kicking the can down the road” and delivering higher costs for taxpayers later.
Kolterman pointed out that during the 2008-09 recession, the state’s retirements plans lost 28% of its assets — about $2 billion — and that it took years of work to make them healthy again.
He cautioned in his letter that Nebraska doesn’t want to find itself in the same situation again —  forced to increase funds toward pension plans. It doesn’t make sense, he argued, to mess with what’s working.
‘Rule of 85’ 
Despite that, and despite similar warnings during floor debate on Thursday from Lincoln Sen. Danielle Conrad, the bill advanced to final reading.
Ballard said that he was “reassured” that LB 645 would not require additional state funds. He quoted from a  projection that even with a 0% increase in state investment income, no additional state contribution would be needed.
On Thursday, he withdrew his amendment that would have changed the state’s long standing “Rule of 85” for teachers that now allows educators, of at least 60 years of age, to retire if they have at least 25 years of service, which adds up to 85. Ballard’s amendment would have allowed younger teachers, of at least 55 years of age, to retire with 30 years of service.
  State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln. Jan. 8, 2025 (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Education groups, during a public hearing on that amendment on Wednesday, had opposed the idea out of concern that its impact — which some feared would increase retirement fund payouts — had not been studied.
Conrad also withdrew a proposed amendment to ensure that the state would not be liable for covering any financial shortages in the Omaha Public Schools retirement plan, a plan that the state recently took over to manage.
The senator said it was a “belt and suspenders” amendment to continue the state’s current policy of not being liable for shortages in that plan. She agreed to let fellow senators have more time to consider her proposal, and that she will reintroduce it during final round debate on LB 645.

,Mississippi Today,2025-04-24 22:21:23+00:00,Mississippi Today,Parents and providers urge state to use unspent TANF grants for child care,Simeon Gates,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/04/24/parents-providers-urge-use-of-unspent-tanf-grants-for-child-care/,Advocates say thousands of Mississippi children might lose child care as state puts hold on assistance program.,"Child care providers, parents, children, legislators and advocates gathered  outside the state Capitol Thursday to call on Mississippi to use unspent welfare funds and resume accepting child care certificate applications.
Last month, the Mississippi Department of Human Services announced it will temporarily stop accepting new applications, redetermination applications and “add a child” applications for the child care certificate program for certain families as the result of the loss of COVID-19 relief funds. The hold, started March 31, will continue indefinitely. The program provides child care vouchers to eligible families, often with a co-payment fee.
MDHS explained that without the COVID-19 relief funding the number of families with child care certificates is more than it can support long term. When asked how long the hold would last, chief communications director Mark Jones explained the hold would end when the number of children with certificates dropped below 27,000 children and $12 million in monthly costs.
The week before the hold began, on March 28, 36,186 children had child care certificates. 25,300 of them fit into one of the MDHS’s priority categories. 10,800 did not.
The Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative, Child Care Directors Network Alliance, Mississippi Delta Licensed Child Care Providers, and Mississippi Black Women’s Roundtable organized Thursday’s gathering and  press conference to implore MDHS to tap into unused TANF funds to book the child care payment program.

“DHS has about $156 million in money from prior grant years that has gone unspent,” said Carol Burnett, MLICCI’s executive director, at the press conference.
The child care payment program gets funding from federal and state sources. It received $127 million from the Child Care Development Fund in fiscal year 2024, as well as $7 million in state appropriations, and $25.9 million transferred from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families grant. 
That $25.9 million is 30% of the state’s annual TANF grant money transferred into funds for child care certificates. It is the maximum amount they’re allowed to transfer under federal law. The state also spends 85% of its money from the child care development fund on certificates, when federal law requires them to use at least 70%. 
MLICCI and others want MDHS to add to that by spending current and carryover TANF funds on child care subsidies for families that qualify for child care certificates. According to a memo MLICCI prepared, this method does not require legislative action, has no  spending limit, and is already used by other states.
Under the current hold, families can apply and get their certificates renewed if they fall in one of the following six categories: on Temporary Assistance for Needy FamiliesTANF or transitioning off of TANF, homeless, with foster children, teen parents, deployed military, orand with special needs. The Division of Early Childhood Care & Development will continue paying for certificates for all families until their certificates expire. 
In a statement, MDHS’ chief communications officer Mark Jones said “MDHS understands these concerns and reaffirms its commitment to support child care, transportation, education, and other needs of families who need to return or remain in the workforce. Our aim is to ensure our approaches are sustainable.”
Burnett, parent KyAsia Johnson, state Rep. Zakiya Summers, D-Jackson, and multiple child care providers talked about the toll the hold has taken on child care centers and families. They also stated the importance of child care to sustain the state’s workforce, keep child care providers afloat, and educate young children. 
They also urged citizens to contact the state’s political leadership to get their attention.
“This decision is putting people like me in an impossible situation,” said Johnson, a child care provider and parent. “What am I supposed to do without child care?”
Each provider spoke about how they had to explain the hold to parents, many of whom have had to pull their children out of day care. Cantrell Keyes, director of Agape Christian Academy World in Jackson, had five families pull their children out of her center. “More than half of my school tuition comes from CCPP,” she said.

Rep. Summers called on MDHS to lift the hold on child care applications, use the extra TANF funds, and communicate better with parents and providers. 
“Right now, thousands of Mississippi children might lose child care, not because the need has disappeared, but because the agency has made a choice,” she said.
The hold on child care certificates comes at a time when many child care providers and parents are struggling to stay afloat amid high costs, high turnover and high demand.

Some people waited over two hours to testify. (Screencap/CapitolTV) Some people waited two hours to speak at Tuesday night’s meeting of the Rhode Island House Committee on Municipal Government and Housing. Some people couldn’t wait and left before they had their chance. 
Rep. Stephen Casey, the Woonsocket Democrat and committee chair, shuffled the six sign-up sheets in his hands, each page filled with the names of Providence residents who wanted to testify at a hearing on a bill that would raise the the city’s levy, or total collected tax revenue, above the statewide 4% cap in fiscal year 2026. The hearing room and overflow area were packed with about 100 people.
As the meeting stretched past 7 p.m., Casey opted for speed over procedure, and told people to leave the microphones on when they came up to testify. 
Smiley puts faith in General Assembly in unveiling $624.1M fiscal 2026 budget

“Don’t anybody touch anything. Just get up there and talk,” he said.
Providence residents had a lot to say about the bill sponsored by Rep. Rebecca Kislak, and three other Democratic reps in the city: Scott Slater, Edith Ajello and Nathan Biah. The bill’s 27-word amendment to the state’s municipal tax law would authorize the capital city to hike its levy on owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied residential properties, commercial properties, tangible properties, and natural growth, or the increase in value of properties over time.
Kislak’s bill would allow Providence to go up to 8% more than last year. Mayor Brett Smiley is proposing a 7.5% increase, announced April 16 in his proposed fiscal 2026 budget.
The impact would hit property owners depending on the kind of home they own and if they live there. The average tax bill for owners who live in their single-family homes or condominium units would go up 4%. But the increase would be 16% for homes with two to five families, whether owner-occupied or not.
“We think that this is, in fact, an extraordinary ask,” Smiley told lawmakers. “But it’s because there are extraordinary circumstances. The last time the city of Providence was at the State House to ask for this was over 15 years ago during the 2008 financial crisis.”
The budgeting maneuver is meant to cushion city finances for fiscal year 2026 against an expensive settlement with the state education department to resolve past underfunding of Providence public schools. But compliance with that November 2024 settlement, which accounts for $11 million in the upcoming fiscal year’s budget and additional investments in subsequent fiscal years, depends on state lawmakers’ approval.
“There are a lot of reasons that Providence has this need to increase the levy,” Kislak said in her introduction of the bill, citing the agreement with the Rhode Island Department of Education as “the most immediate.” 
“We will be fixing…30 years of underfunding of our schools in just three years,” Kislak said. “We should do it. It’s painful, and it’s so important to the city.” 
No Plan B
Without the General Assembly’s approval, Smiley has said his budget will need to return to the Providence City Council and substantial revisions made. The council is still engaged in the budgeting process with a final version emerging in June. Ahead of Kislak’s April 2 introduction of the bill, the council voted to affirm up to an 8% increase. 
Democratic Rep. David Morales of Providence — a 26-year-old lawmaker who’s floated the idea of running for mayor himself one day — wondered why no Plan B was in place.
“Has your administration prepared an alternative budget in the case that the committee does not move forward with this levy proposal?” Morales asked Smiley. 
“No, we have not,” the mayor replied. 










We will be fixing…30 years of underfunding of our schools in just three years. We should do it. It’s painful, and it’s so important to the city. 


– Rep. Rebecca Kislak, a Providence Democrat and sponsor of the bill authorizing the capital city to exceed state tax levy cap


Morales also asked Smiley if he would stay for the entirety of the hearing, “because we have dozens of working people across the city of Providence that are here to share their perspective,” Morales said.
Smiley replied: “I appreciate that. I’ll stay as long as I can.”
In a phone interview Thursday, Morales said Smiley left before residents had their turn to testify but encountered residents outside the committee hearing room. A WPRI-12 report on Tuesday confirmed that Smiley spent time talking to residents for some time in the State House rotunda, explaining his budget in detail.
“Mayor (and also in a different spot I) stayed for hours talking to people in the hallway,” Kislak said via text message Wednesday. “We should pass this bill plus additional revenue bills that will give the city council and mayor additional flexibility in their budget negotiations.”
Some of the additional revenue bills Kislak previously mentioned include taxes on parking lots and Airbnbs.
Josh Estrella, a spokesperson for the mayor, said in a statement Wednesday, “Mayor Smiley has been attending community meetings in every ward of Providence collecting feedback from neighbors and explaining the critical importance of this legislation and he was glad to have stayed at the State House last night to answer every question community members had.”
Morales was disappointed in Smiley’s showing before the committee, he said. “I think he was dismissive…He opted to talk about the complex formula as to how one’s property taxes are calculated, which I think was an easy cop-out from actually answering any questions.”
A threatened ‘speck of green’
Many people testifying Tuesday were addressing lawmakers for the first time, Morales said, and some spoke through Spanish interpreters. Residents worried about tax hikes being passed to renters, making apartments unaffordable and ultimately leading to displacement. 
Charles Pinning, a landlord and part-time writing professor at the University of Rhode Island, explained how the levy hike would affect his tenants: “These people who have spoken, ‘Oh, yeah, when I rent the apartment, I will pass it on to them.’ They’re absolutely correct.”
Providence residents viewed the committee as an important blockade against the tax hike’s passage, arguing that the City Council will likely approve the measure. But the House committee emphasized its role is to merely allow the levy hike to happen. The venue for resisting the hike itself, they suggested, was at City Council hearings instead.
Casey, the chair, at times told public testimonies to stay on track, and not stray into discussions of the city’s housing market or general critiques of Smiley. He told one man his testimony’s content was better suited to a Facebook post. 
“This bill has been held for further study,” Casey said. “Everybody needs to relax. We’re not going to vote on it today.”
Fixed-income homeowners, including senior citizens, said a 25% additional property tax exemption for senior citizens under Smiley’s budget was insufficient. Sandra Lee, a low-income senior citizen and 25-year resident of the Mount Hope neighborhood, said her property assessment went up 100% in the most recent valuation, and her lot 521%. 
“I own a little home there, and I own a little speck of green,” Lee said. “My right to quiet enjoyment is being threatened, and I don’t know what to do. I feel completely powerless.”
City councilors host community meetings
The bill was held for further study, as is standard practice on an initial hearing. Based on conversations with his colleagues before and after Tuesday’s hearing, Morales thinks the committee vote will not be unanimous.
Morales said Thursday he was proud of the people in his city who showed up to be heard, and hoped his fellow committee members were listening closely.
“I hope that they recognize that these stories of hardships are going to become reality if we’re not conscientious about our own decisions when we vote on this,” Morales said.

At the hearing, Rep. José Batstia of Providence told fellow Democrat Smiley that he understands how the city has been wedged between a multimillion dollar rock and the hard place of a tax increase. But he said he would not support the levy hike, because he thinks the city is not doing enough to extract money from the city’s wealthy nonprofits like Brown University.
Smiley, in part, agreed. Nearly half of the city’s property is tax-exempt, he said, adding the city is “burdened with a hugely disproportionate share of the tax-exempt properties in Rhode Island: the colleges, the hospitals, government, churches and certain nonprofits.”
“It is, I know, very popular, and certainly the size of their endowment makes it eye- popping. But it is not just Brown,” Smiley said.
Morales thinks the city has not explored all its options, citing industrial, waterfront properties on the city’s south side. “They can certainly afford to pay more in their taxes,” Morales said, an alternative to what he described as the overly broad taxation in Smiley’s strategy, in which “owner-occupied, multifamily homes…are going to feel the brunt of this increase.” 
Meanwhile the budgeting process chugs along on the city side. In an email Thursday, Marc Boyd, a City Council spokesperson, said individual councilors have been holding community meetings over the past month with residents in their respective wards to hear concerns about “revaluations, property taxes, the levy overall, and the budget process broadly.” 
“Now that the mayor has proposed his budget, the Finance Committee will review, vet, and, if necessary, amend the mayor’s proposal as part of the normal budget process which, as usual, will include public hearings, the first of which is scheduled for May 6th,” Boyd said.
Boyd added that on Saturday, May 3, several Spanish-speaking councilors will be hosting a Latino Town Hall to discuss the same issues with Spanish-speaking residents. English translation will be available, and the event runs from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. at the Providence Career and Technical Academy on Fricker Street.

(Danielle Prokop / Source New Mexico)The Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument in Las Cruces is one of six national monuments Interior Department officials have identified to lose federal protections, two sources told the Washington Post in a story published Thursday. 
Those federal protections prevent private companies from exploiting the monuments for minerals, oil and gas or other commodities. In addition to the monument in Southern New Mexico, the Post names ones in Utah, Arizona and California, including Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon, Ironwood Forest, Chuckwalla, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, on the list.
Being added to the list means Interior Department officials are reviewing geological maps to analyze the potential for mining and oil production and to assess whether to revise their boundaries, one person told the Washington Post, which provided the person anonymity to discuss decisions that had not yet been made.
Members of the state’s congressional delegation also named Organ Mountains Desert Peaks as one of three national monuments in the state — along with Rio Grande del Norte and Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks — potentially on the chopping block in a letter earlier this week to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, which urged him to maintain protections.
NM delegation: Three national monuments could be reduced, eliminated

Patrick Nolan, executive director of the Friends of Desert Mountains-Organ Peaks organization, told Source New Mexico that the Thursday report represents the clearest sign yet that the “extremely popular” monument could lose its protections.
“These rumors have been percolating for a few months, and I think this is the most tangible, real thing that we have seen,” he said in a phone interview. “Right now, I have to assume that it’s real.”
Heinrich, in a post on social media, criticized the Interior Department for the prospect of selling off public lands to the highest bidder. 
“Stripping Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks of its protections would be a reckless abuse of power and a slap in the face to countless New Mexicans. We have a moral responsibility to future generations that supersedes any ultra wealthy executive’s desire to line their pockets,” he wrote. 
The report coincides with a leak of a draft strategy document at Interior first reported on by news organization Public Domain. The strategy document, which Source NM also obtained, lays out the messaging and objectives the department intends to use as it explores things like “releas[ing] federal holdings to allow state and local communities to reduce costs” and “increas[ing] revenues from grazing, timber, critical minerals, gravel and other non-energy resources.” 
Nolan noted that Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks is a relatively new national monument, first granted federal protection in 2014 under President  Barack Obama. During President Donald Trump’s first term, his administration reviewed it and other Southwest monuments to potentially strip their federal protections. 
In that period, Nolan said, no mining or other private interest clamored to extract resources from the land now protected.
“It makes it more confusing,” he said. “Because there is no known, at least to me and the general public, presence of these materials. So it really calls into question, what is the real intention behind these reviews and boundary redrawing?”
Nolan’s best guess? “They don’t like protected public lands,” he said. 
In the decade since becoming a national monument, Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks has become wildly popular and a major economic driver in the region, Nolan said. Businesses like Organ Mountain Outfitters have popped up, and it’s become a national destination for bicycle backpacking, he said. 
According to a study commission by the Las Cruces Green Chamber published last year, the designation of Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks has resulted in a $234 million economic impact over the last decade. Visitation to the area increased from 183,900 in 2012, which was before it became a national monument, to 612,781 in 2022, according to the report. 
The news of Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks moving closer to losing its protected status drew rebukes across New Mexico’s conservation interest groups. New Mexico Wild is one of them.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThe president of the state employees union accused the Vermont Department for Children and Families of retaliating against her after she spoke out about a new return-to-office policy — retribution that, she said, included secretly filming her during a remote staff meeting.Aimee Bertrand, the president of the Vermont State Employees’ Association and an employee of the department’s Economic Services Division, raised the allegations Thursday morning during a meeting of the House Committee on Human Services. “I’ve been a union activist for over 20 years,” Bertrand said in sometimes tearful testimony. “I have suspected being watched, but I have never concretely seen it.”That is, until now, she said. The alleged recording took place amid union frustration over the department’s decision last fall to bring some division staffers back to the office after several years in which they had the option of working remotely. In late October, Bertrand had expressed disappointment about the fact that Commissioner Chris Winters had not addressed the new remote work policy in his weekly email update.“Your failure to recognize and respond to the fears and concerns of your workforce is disappointing,” Bertrand wrote in an emailed reply to that update — in which she copied the entirety of the department staff.In her telling, that started a campaign of retaliation from management. The department lowered her score in a performance evaluation and launched an audit of her use of personal medical leave — something Bertrand said she’d never heard of happening before.Bertrand said she filed an unfair labor practice charge over those actions in March. A week later, she said, she was told that she was under investigation for an alleged breach of confidentiality.READ MORE





 


Vermont department orders some workers back to the office

That alleged breach occurred during an Economic Services Division all-staff meeting conducted on Microsoft Teams in November. During that meeting, staffers were required to have their cameras on, Bertrand told lawmakers, and the meetings were supposed to be confidential.Bertrand said she took the meeting sitting in her kitchen. While there, she said, her partner walked behind her, through the frame of her computer camera, to get a cup of coffee.During DCF’s investigation, she said, she was shown cellphone photos of a computer screen showing her on camera with her partner walking behind her. Later, she said, she viewed a 10-minute cellphone video from which those photos were drawn. That video was filmed by a DCF manager on their phone and focused on the video stream from Bertrand’s computer camera — essentially, a window into her kitchen.“It’s so so, so violating,” Bertrand said in an interview Thursday. “I am so creeped out by it.”Winters, the Department for Children and Families commissioner, said that he was unable to discuss Bertrand’s situation because it is a personnel matter. But he praised the staff of the Economic Services Division, saying in a text message that they do a “tough job under often difficult circumstances.”Those workers have “been asked to do so much with the GA Housing program that is constantly shifting – with more changes than any other state program,” Winters said, adding that the decision to end remote work for some staffers was not made lightly.“I’m glad they have a union to represent them and a forum to speak out,” he said.The investigation ultimately found that the claims of violating confidentiality were not substantiated, Bertrand told legislators Thursday through tears. VTDigger could not confirm the results of the investigation.  Lawmakers in the Human Services Committee room seemed taken aback by Bertrand’s testimony.“I’m not exactly sure what we can do, but it won’t just stop here,” committee chair Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, said. Read the story on VTDigger here:  State employees union president accuses department of retaliation, secretly filming her during meeting.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/public-pensions-4-20250107.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 19:06:59.387921

SPRINGFIELD – Standing on his backyard deck Thursday – the same place where he declared his 1996 candidacy for U.S. Senate – Illinois’ senior Sen. Dick Durbin reflected on his decision to retire after four decades in Congress.

“I’ve done this my way, making decisions based on family needs and personal needs, and what I thought would serve our state well,” Durbin told reporters with a crowd of staff, family and friends listening in the background.

Durbin, a Springfield Democrat who was born in East St. Louis, announced Wednesday he will retire from the Senate when his term ends in 2027 following 44 years in Congress. He has been the No. 2 ranking Democrat in the Senate since taking over as caucus whip in 2005 and chaired the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee during the Biden administration.

Durbin, 80, would be 88 at the end of another term if he won in the 2026 election. Durbin said he still feels up to the job today, but that may not be the case by the time another term would end in 2033.

Durbin is one of six senators who are at least 80 years old. The age of the nation’s leaders became a key issue early in the 2024 presidential election after a poor debate performance by former President Joe Biden, who was 81 at the time. President Donald Trump is 78.



[embed][/embed]



Durbin said he doesn’t believe age has ever gotten in the way of his job.

“I had to project forward,” Durbin said. “The campaign’s going to last two years, and then you’re going to serve six years. So are you ready to make an eight-year commitment? That’s the truth and reality of the United States Senate. I didn’t think at this point it was the right thing to do.”

There’s still more he wants to accomplish as a legislator, Durbin said, despite being in the minority party in Congress. He said Trump’s second administration made his decision more difficult.

“The madder I got about what Trump is doing to this country and to the Constitution, the more I wanted to serve and not step aside,” Durbin said.

Durbin didn’t express any regrets about the job, noting that on a personal level, he flew home from Washington, D.C., every weekend of his career. But in the legislature, Durbin has long sponsored the DREAM Act – an initiative to create a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and could be subject to deportation. Durbin has unsuccessfully pushed the bill for more than 20 years.

“The first time I’d ever met Donald Trump, he had just been sworn in as president. I was at a luncheon and walked up to him and said, ‘I want to talk to you about the DREAM Act,’” Durbin recalled. “He said, ‘you don’t have to say another word. You’re talking about those young kids? I’ll take care of them.’”

The DREAM Act was a basis for DACA, short for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which was established in 2012 under President Barack Obama. Trump tried to phase out the program during his first term. Durbin said that while he continues to push Congress to pass the DREAM Act, he doesn’t believe it will move forward during his final years with Trump at the helm.

Durbin’s retirement is expected to open the door for a dozen or more Illinois Democrats to throw their hat into a 2026 Democratic primary. Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, a Chicago Democrat, became the first person to launch a Senate campaign Thursday morning.

“I’m not planning on endorsing any particular candidate,” Durbin said. “I hope I don’t have to but I’m not ruling out the possibility in an extreme case. I just think it’s up to the voters, the Democratic voters, to make this choice moving forward.”

He acknowledged talking with Stratton and other candidates about running for office, chiefly that no one interested in running for Senate wanted to run against Durbin in a primary.

Durbin represents an old breed in Illinois politics of influential downstate Democrats. He succeeded his mentor, the late former Sen. Paul Simon, who was also a downstate Democrat. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Hoffman Estates in Cook County, will become the state’s senior senator in 2027.

The Democratic nominee for Durbin’s seat could be from the Chicago area. Durbin said the state’s next senator must represent the interests of the whole state.

“Work the entire state. Discover downstate if you don’t know it,” Durbin said. “Discover the suburbs, the surrounding counties and Cook County, the city of Chicago … that’s been one of the real blessings of this job.”

(Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa House sent a bill to the governor Thursday that would allow hard roofs over boat docks, slips and lifts in Iowa. 
House File 710 advanced from the Senate floor Wednesday, with an amendment that swapped the term “enclosed structure” to “roof” in the bill. The House approved the amendment from senators. 
Rep. Josh Turek, D-Council Bluffs, said the legislation would “put Iowa’s boat dock regulations in line with the other 49 states,” which he said do not prohibit hard roofs on docks. 
Current law only allows roofs or siding of “soft-sided” materials over boat hoists. The issue has made regulation difficult on Carter Lake, which is in both Iowa and Nebraska.
Turek said he does not own a dock or a boat on Carter Lake, despite an allegation made the day prior on the Senate floor by Sen. Dave Sires, R-Cedar Falls, that the legislation was sponsored by a “House of Representative person who built an illegal dock on Carter Lake.” 
Sires opposed the bill, saying hard roofs would cause more damage to an area during flooding or high winds and allow gargantuan docks to be built.
The bill would require that docks with roofs be less than 30 feet wide, and no taller than 20 feet above the surface of the water. Dock owners would also be required to maintain dock liability insurance of at least $1 million per occurrence to be in compliance with the bill. 
Rep. Austin Harris, R-Moulton, thanked the people of Carter Lake who he said were “very, very persistent” on the bill. 
HF 710 advanced unanimously from the House.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)The superminority status of the Florida Democratic Party in the state Legislature just got smaller when Democratic Senate Leader Jason Pizzo stunningly announced that he was leaving the party and would become a political independent.
Democrats already had just 11 members in the 40-member chamber, after Orange County Sen. Geraldine Thompson died just weeks before this year’s legislative session began. They are now down to just 10 members.
“The Democratic Party in Florida is dead,” he said while speaking on the floor of the Senate following the conclusion of the chamber’s business for the day. “But there are good people that can resuscitate it, but they don’t want it to be me.”
He went on to say that the Democratic Party that his father volunteered for when John F. Kennedy ran for president in 1960 was not the same party today.
“It craves and screams anarchy and then demands amnesty, and that’s not okay,” he said. “I’ve always been criticized by the far left and the far right,  but you know what the small businesses and the hard-working families and the teachers and the cops and the firemen want us to do?  Be public servants, not politicians.”
A former assistant state’s attorney in Miami-Dade County, Pizzo has had a reputation as a centrist Democrat since his election to the Senate in 2018, and at times has angered the more liberal parts of the party, particularly regarding criminal justice issues.
He’s also one of the wealthiest members of the Legislature, with an estimated worth of $59 million, based on his 2023 financial disclosure forms.
Whether this will affect his putative plan to run for governor is uncertain at this point. He has previously said he was considering the possibility, although he said in January that he would not run as a political independent.
Some of the party’s top leaders reacted with anger to Pizzo’s announcement.
“Jason Pizzo is one of the most ineffective and unpopular Democratic leaders in recent memory, and his resignation is one of the best things to happen to the party in years,” said Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried in a statement.
“His legacy as leader includes continually disparaging the party base, starting fights with other members, and chasing his own personal ambitions at the expense of Democratic values,” Fried continued.
“Jason’s failure to build support within our party for a gubernatorial run has led to this final embarrassing temper tantrum. I’d be lying if I said I’m sad to see him go, but I wish him the best of luck in the political wilderness he’s created for himself. The Florida Democratic Party is more united without him.”
Hillsborough Democrat Fentrice Driskell, the party’s leader in the House, similarly made blistering remarks about her now former Democratic colleague.
“The party needs strong Democrats who are ready to stand up to Trump, not big egos more interested in performative outrage than true leadership. Legislative Democrats will be fine without him,” she said in a statement. “The Democratic Party is not dead, but if it was Jason Pizzo should consider the fact that he has been a party leader and would bear some responsibility.”
Stunned
Pizzo’s Democratic Senate colleagues seemed stunned — and more charitable about Pizzo’s bombshell.
“It’s a surprise to us,” said South Florida Democratic Sen. Shevrin Jones.
“We need to process all this information,” added Palm Beach Sen. Lori Berman. “He is certainly independent and he did what he felt was right for himself, and like Sen. Jones said, I think he’s not going to become a far-right wing Republican by any means, and he will continue to be an effective voice here in the Florida Legislature and hopefully a voice of reason, as he has been.”
Pizzo is the third state Democratic lawmaker to leave the party in the past half-year. In December, Hillsborough County Rep. Susan Valdés switched to the GOP immediately after losing a bid to lead the Hillsborough County Democratic Party. Weeks later, Broward County Democrat Hillary Cassel did the same, saying the party no longer represented her values.
Republican Party of Florida Chair Evan Power responded in a statement that Pizzo could have waited until the end of the legislative session, “but it’s clear he could no longer tolerate the direction of the party.”
Power’s comment does lead into the question of why Pizzo chose Thursday, just eight days before the legislative session is scheduled to end, to make his announcement (although Senate President Ben Albritton announced earlier in the day that the session would go beyond next Friday due to an impasse regarding the state budget).
Earlier in the day, former Florida GOP Congressman David Jolly announced that he was switching from being a non-party-affiliated voter and was now a registered Democrat, fueling speculation that he in fact will run for the party’s nomination for governor in 2026.

A federal grand jury indicted Nasir Ullah, 28, and Naim Ullah, 32, both of Sumter, as well as Puquan Huang, 49, of Burford, Georgia, acting U.S. Attorney Brook Andrews announced Thursday. Each faces a charge of conspiracy to launder money, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
  Nasir Ullah, 28, of Sumter (Mugshot provided by Sumter County Sheriff’s Department)
Lawyers for the men did not respond to messages from the SC Daily Gazette.
The men stand accused of laundering more than $30 million in illegal drug proceeds, taking cash from known drug sales associated with two major Mexican cartels and using it to purchase and ship electronics to Hong Kong, China and the United Arab Emirates to be sold for a profit.
“Money laundering is the backbone of criminal enterprise,” Andrews said. “It enables drug trafficking organizations to purchase and distribute fentanyl and other drugs to devastating effect. When we target those who launder drug money, we strike at the very heart of these operations.”
Law enforcement alleges the men collected money from various locations in York, Richland, Sumter and Charleston counties, as well as from other states across the Southeast. They stored the cash at a pair of business properties in Sumter.
  Naim Ullah, 32, of Sumter (Mugshot provided by Sumter County Sheriff’s Department)
Police and federal agents raided those businesses in late January, as well as two homes, arresting Nasir Ullah, Naim Ullah and one other man in Sumter, multiple television news stations reported.
They seized an estimated $230,000 in cash, three vehicles, 11 guns and hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of jewelry in the raids.
Court documents also reference hundreds of millions of dollars seized during multiple traffic stops in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina between July 2021 and November 2024.
Police traced the money to the sale of fentanyl, cocaine, marijuana and heroin.
Two milligrams of fentanyl, which is roughly the size of the tip of a sharpened pencil, is a lethal dose, said Mike Tooley, an assistant special agent with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency.
By comparison, just one of the seizures involving $177,000 of cash would be enough to purchase seven kilograms of powdered fentanyl. That amount of fentanyl could kill 3.5 million people, or more than half the population of South Carolina.

In an acceptance speech, Bedenbaugh thanked his colleagues and the students he teaches, saying they impart as much wisdom to him as he does to them.
“To every student out there, you are the reason we do this,” Bedenbaugh said. “Your dreams, your resilience and your light fuel our purpose.”
Bedenbaugh initially wanted to become a lawyer, but the prelaw classes he took during his first year at Newberry College didn’t inspire him, he said. At the urging of his college advisor, Bedenbaugh enrolled in education classes with the aim of becoming a history teacher.
Those classes “allowed me to see the true impact (my teachers) had left in me, an impact that I had not really seen prior to thinking about it,” Bedenbaugh said.
Along with teaching, Bedenbaugh founded “Bow Ties with Bedenbaugh,” a mentorship program meant to teach young men life skills. He also coaches a girls’ basketball team and sponsors the school’s student council and Fellowship of Christian Athletes, according to the state Department of Education.
“Corey Bedenbaugh is an outstanding educator who goes above and beyond to inspire his students every day,” his district superintendent, Ashley Atkinson, said in a statement.
Each school district in the state selects its own teacher of the year, which the Department of Education narrows down to five finalists. Each receives $10,000.
On top of an additional $15,000 from the state, Bedenbaugh received $2,000 from the Bojangles Foundation Fund, a BMW to drive for the coming year and the ability to take classes tuition-free toward a graduate degree from the University of South Carolina.
“This award is an honor and acknowledgement, but the real reward is the privilege of teaching,” said Bedenbaugh, who already holds a master’s degree in curriculum and instruction from the University of Phoenix.
The award also comes with extra responsibility. Bedenbaugh will spend the next year mentoring other teachers, working with high-achieving high school students who want to join the profession and leading an annual conference for educators.
While the award goes to one teacher, it’s meant to highlight the work of educators as a whole in helping the next generation of students grow, Weaver said.
“We’re honoring all of those whose lasting influence stays long after classroom lights go out, those who are writing South Carolina’s next chapter, one student, one lesson plan, one incredible breakthrough at a time,” Weaver said.
Legislators in recent years have taken steps toward hiking teachers’ pay and improving their working conditions.
Since 2017, the state-funded minimum salary for first-year teachers has risen from $30,100 to $47,000, with legislators set to provide an additional $1,500 boost for the coming school year. That will bring the minimum pay for a teacher with 12 years of experience and a master’s degree — what’s loosely considered an average — to $58,750.
Gov. Henry McMaster noted that more funding has also provided more mental health professionals and law enforcement officers in schools.
All of that has been to help the state’s teachers, said the governor, who fondly recalled the teachers who have shaped his own life.
“Ladies and gentlemen, if someone doesn’t teach it to you, you’re not going to know it,” McMaster said.
Bedenbaugh called on everyone in the audience to continue supporting educators.
“Together, let’s continue to champion the power of education, because when we invest in our children, we invest in the future of our great state,” Bedenbaugh said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-24-at-5.10.57-PM-1024x546.png,,,2025-04-24 18:07:37.271505

California receives $2.4 billion in federal Title I money for low-income schools, about $1.3 billion for special education and $250 million for after-school programs, among other grants. 


California K-12 schools got a reprieve today when a judge blocked President Donald Trump’s order to eliminate diversity programs or risk losing federal funding.
New Hampshire Judge Landya McCafferty said Trump’s order didn’t sufficiently define diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, limited free speech and went beyond his authority. The Trump administration is likely to appeal the ruling, but for now it means that the federal government must continue to fund special education, after-school programs, services for low-income students and other federal programs.

Advice to California schools on Trump’s DEI crackdown: Do nothing — yet 

by Carolyn Jones 





The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Education Association, the country’s largest teachers union. They alleged that Trump’s DEI order was overly vague and would cause undue harm to students. California had responded to the order by saying its schools were already in compliance with civil rights laws.
California joined about a dozen states in pushing back against the order. Separately, the Trump administration said it would withhold federal K-12 money to Maine over its protections for transgender students, and is investigating California over the same issue.
McCafferty’s ruling only applied to schools that have at least one staff person who belongs to the National Education Association, which is nearly all schools in California.
Politics and Title I
California receives $2.4 billion in federal Title I money for low-income schools, about $1.3 billion for special education, $250 million for after-school programs, and millions more in grants for career education, school meals and other programs.
The Trump administration said they didn’t intend to cut special education funding, but Title I and other programs were potentially at risk. In the current wobbly economic climate, it’s doubtful that the state would be able to backfill the lost revenue, and those programs would almost certainly face steep cuts if not total elimination.
Trump is not the first president to threaten to withhold Title I funds, the largest piece of federal K-12 money. Not long after Congress created Title I in 1965, President Lyndon Johnson threatened to withhold it from schools in the South that refused to desegregate.
Other presidents have occasionally threatened to withhold federal funds to schools, although none have actually done it, said Sarah Reber, a senior fellow in economics policy at the Brookings Institution.
“It’s not unusual to have Title I get caught up in controversies, but it’s never over the value of Title I itself,” Reber said. “It’s usually over a broader political issue.”
Nearly every district in California gets some Title I funding, which schools use to hire tutors and aides, reduce class sizes, and purchase books and other materials. The government requires that schools use the money to help low-income students, who typically don’t perform as well academically as their peers.
The money goes from the federal government to the state to school districts, which distribute it to schools that have a certain percentage of low-income students. The amount of money has mostly been stable year to year, although during the pandemic the government gave schools billions more money in COVID relief grants based on the Title I formula. 
Losing Title I money now would be especially difficult for schools as their emergency pandemic grants are expiring and states are experiencing budget uncertainties, Reber said.
After-school and summer programs
Another significant portion of federal K-12 funding is the 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which funds after-school and summer programs. In California, the money supplements the state’s contributions to those programs and is the only source of funding for high school after-school programs, such as student government or homework help.
“Without 21st Century grants, those programs would be wiped out,” said Heather Williams, director of policy and outreach for the California AfterSchool Network. 
Until 2006, federal funding was the primary source of support for after-school programs, and offerings were scant. But Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Gov. Gavin Newsom both championed the potential for after-school programming as a safe place where children could get healthy snacks, tutoring and a gamut of enrichment activities. During the pandemic, California created the Expanded Learning Opportunities Programming, which last year distributed $4 billion to elementary schools.
Although after-school programs have garnered bipartisan support, Williams is wary of the current administration. During Trump’s first term, he tried to cut 21st Century grants all four years, but was thwarted by Congress.
“We’ve known for a long time that after school programs are important,” Williams said. “But right now it seems people are caught up in a broader political argument that overlooks the value of actual programs.”

As bill sponsors in the Michigan House Government Operations Committee argued Thursday that sanctuary statuses threaten public safety and social welfare and housing funds should go towards only legal citizens, immigration stakeholders argued the proposals are dehumanizing and destructive.
All of the bills presented Thursday cleared the Republican-controlled committee without support from the two Democratic members, though the bills would not likely gain enough support in the Democratic-led state Senate to make it to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, also a Democrat, to be signed into law.
Bills the committee heard testimony for, House Bills 4338 and 4339, would ban local governments and counties from creating or enforcing sanctuary city or county policies, ordinances or laws. Municipalities with existing sanctuary city policies would have 60 days after the bill goes into effect to remove the policy.
Additionally, Rep. James DeSana (R-Carleton) is sponsoring House Bill 4342 to penalize any municipality that doesn’t cut its sanctuary policies by withholding state revenue sharing dollars, which fund local police and fire departments, as well as road repairs and sewage systems.
“My goal in speaking here today is to stress how reckless sanctuary policies are and how they shield criminals and put them before Michigan residents who want to raise their families in safe communities,” DeSana said. “Communities that choose to ignore our federal immigration laws are putting lives at risk and it’s time we hold them accountable.”
Official sanctuary cities are nearly non-existent in Michigan, with some cities like Lansing operating as unofficial sanctuary municipalities, instructing law enforcement not to inquire about a person’s immigration status unless necessary. Some municipalities like Detroit and Bay City have adopted “welcoming” statuses to welcome individuals of all immigration statuses.
Amongst the organizations that wrote in their opposition to the bills was the Michigan Sheriffs’ Association.
With the strains that are already on public safety agencies, Yvonne Navarrete, policy director for We the People Michigan, said the last thing they should be prioritizing is dedicating any time or resources to complying or helping federal immigration officials. And with individuals already being detained and deported without due process under President Donald Trump’s administration, further opening the door to federal agents will only further weaken the systems of justice in the U.S., Navarrette said.
“I’m begging for competence…You can’t even define what a sanctuary policy is,” Navarrete said. “All I’m asking is that if you are so bold enough to take my public tax dollars and be a policy maker, at least be competent and write coherent policies that are efficient, that don’t waste our public tax dollars and actually do the thing you want them to do.”
Other bills the committee considered were House Bills 4340 and 4341, which would amend Michigan’s Social Welfare Act and State Housing Development Authority Act to prohibit non U.S. citizens from receiving services or grants provided under those acts. 
Downriver Reps. Rylee Linting (R-Grosse Ile) and Jamie Thompson (R-Brownstown), who are sponsoring the bills, asserted that these policies would allow limited state services to go to “lawful citizens” who are struggling.
There is a lot of suffering in Michigan, Rep. John Fitzgerald (D-Wyoming) said, from food insecurity, homelessness and in general, barriers to family prosperity. However, the bills before the committee appear to leave the most vulnerable individuals in the state left out of life-saving services, Fitzgerald said, asking if noncitizens who are survivors of domestic violence or children who have experienced violence would still be allowed access.
“They would absolutely be eligible for services if they are legal Americans, if they came here legally,” Thompson said, offering her concern for the people in her district that can’t find affordable housing amidst Michigan’s housing crisis.
“It is important that we prioritize those who are here legally and are actually American citizens before we move on to anything else,” Linting said. “These bills are showing compassion to… the veterans living on the streets who served our country, families that are struggling, and ultimately, it is a slap in the face to immigrants who have come here legally, waited in line and now they are struggling and need help, for us to put someone here illegally, to put them ahead of them.”
There’s a presumption that Michigan’s noncitizen community doesn’t contribute to the state’s economy, Lisa Hile of the Rural Caucus of the Michigan Democratic Party said. But immigrants are the backbone of Michigan’s agricultural industry, a top industry in the state, Hile said, and beyond that, they are valued members of communities all over Michigan.
“They’re not taking anything from you,” Hile said. “You’re turning people on each other for absolutely no reason whatsoever. I’m tired. You’re… trying to get people to believe there’s problems that’s not here.”
A 2024 study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimated that undocumented immigrants in Michigan contributed more than $290 million in state and local taxes in 2022.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Facetune_24-04-2025-17-00-46-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-24 18:07:37.271505

Developers are cheering the so-called CHIP program, which would finance infrastructure to support development, including in towns that weren’t able to take advantage of similar options in the past. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Proposed infrastructure financing program would allow even small Vermont towns to incentivize housing.","This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.Jonah Richard wants to build a new neighborhood in Bradford, an Orange County town of about 2,800. Richard envisions 15 small “starter home” cottages tucked off the town’s main drag. His hope is to sell them at a price point that has become vanishingly rare in Vermont: under $300,000.But it would only work, he says, with water and sewer system financing from an initiative under consideration at the Statehouse – the Community and Housing Infrastructure Program, or CHIP.“Without CHIP, this project doesn’t move forward. With CHIP, it does,” said Richard, founder of the Upper Valley-based developer Village Ventures.If the proposed program can bring in half a million dollars to help cover infrastructure costs – about 10-15% of the project’s total estimated price tag, Richard said – it could make the neighborhood, currently in its pre-development stage, pencil out.CHIP is essentially a small-scale version of Vermont’s longstanding tax increment financing program, or TIF, which allows municipalities to borrow money for public infrastructure like roads, sidewalks, and wastewater projects in an area where they want to see growth – with the expectation that new infrastructure will spur new development. The increased tax revenue from the new development then pays off the debt for the infrastructure.The complexity involved in managing large TIF districts means that only Vermont’s larger cities and towns have used them. CHIP is designed to use the same tax increment financing concept, but at the scale of a single property. “CHIP allows communities – especially, I think, our smaller communities – to say, ‘What’s that one project? What’s that one piece of infrastructure that we could put in, that we would bond for once, that could be a catalyst for housing development?’” said Megan Sullivan, a lobbyist for the Vermont Chamber of Commerce and a former executive director of the Vermont Economic Progress Council, which oversees the TIF program. Developers big and small have voiced their support for CHIP, and the new housing advocacy group Let’s Build Homes, of which Richards is a board member, has thrown its full weight behind it. Gov. Phil Scott’s administration proposed a similar program at the outset of this year’s legislative session and officials have indicated their continued support. The housing package that contains CHIP cleared the Senate last month and is currently making its way through the House. Advocates for Vermont municipalities say the program offers a critical new option for cities and towns to spur housing development and grow their grand lists. Right now, to fund new infrastructure, municipalities have to raise property taxes or water rates, said Samantha Sheehan, a lobbyist for the Vermont League of Cities and Towns. Or municipalities can go to the state for a grant – an option that only exists when funding is made available through the state budget. READ MORE





 


Phil Scott outlines proposal for making it ‘faster, easier and less expensive’ to build housing

The other way municipalities get new infrastructure, Sheehan said, is when housing developers pay for it themselves – and bake the cost of infrastructure into the price of housing.“That raises rents or homeownership for whomever moves into that housing development first,”Sheehan said. CHIP aims to move away from that model. CHIP is not the first “project-based TIF” program to circulate around the Legislature in recent years, Sullivan said. Prior versions haven’t made it to the finish line because of concerns that plague the TIF program more broadly: that development that has occurred in TIF districts would have happened even without the financing mechanism, and therefore hasn’t justified the foregone property tax revenue to the state’s overstretched Education Fund.CHIP has garnered similar critiques. State Auditor Doug Hoffer, a frequent critic of Vermont’s TIF program, has become the CHIP initiative’s most vocal detractor in recent weeks. In an interview, Hoffer emphasized that the Legislature’s nonpartisan financial analysts have not been able to determine the fiscal impacts of CHIP due to a host of unknown factors: the scope of the program’s eventual utilization, the size of future projects, and “the amount of development that would occur absent the program,” according to a Joint Fiscal Office memo from early April.Hoffer also challenged whether the CHIP program as currently envisioned would provide an adequate public benefit, if it ultimately gives an incentive to the builders of market-rate homes. He argued that CHIP should include an affordability requirement for the housing it helps finance.“Otherwise, you’re going to have developers doing what they do. They’re going to seek to maximize profit – and that’s capitalism,” he said. “But if that doesn’t serve a really serious public need, then I’m asking myself, why do we need this program?” Affordable housing funders have echoed the need to incentivize income-restricted housing as part of the program. Because financing capacity would be a function of property value, higher-value homes would bring the largest benefits under the CHIP program, Gus Seelig, executive director of the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board, told lawmakers on Thursday.“It pushes against building more modest homes because it’ll produce a smaller tax base upon which you’d be able to pay off the infrastructure,” he said.But other proponents of CHIP have argued that its flexibility is key to its ultimate success.“The reality is that in order to achieve 36,000 homes in five years, we need policy that is housing-type agnostic,” Sheehan said, referring to a recent statewide housing needs assessment. “We need housing types of all kinds that are built in every community at the density that’s appropriate for that community.” The House Committee on Commerce and Economic Development is currently considering changes to the bill, like honing in on what types of infrastructure improvements can qualify, where CHIP projects will be allowed, and how much housing a proposed project must have, versus commercial space. “We want to make sure that we’re doing due diligence – we have, you know, good guardrails around the program. But not hampering it so much that they won’t be able to do anything,” said Rep. Michael Marcotte, R-Coventry, the committee’s chair.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Proposed infrastructure financing program would allow even small Vermont towns to incentivize housing.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/housing-construction-5-20220531.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 18:07:37.271505

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The activities of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents around the Milwaukee County Courthouse continue to spur controversy. Late last week, ICE agents arrested Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant accused of misdemeanor battery. Flores-Ruiz appeared in Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan’s court on April 18, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. 
Now, the FBI is investigating whether Dugan helped an undocumented immigrant avoid arrest after that immigrant appeared in her courtroom. Although the immigrant hasn’t been identified, Flores-Ruiz, whose immigration status is unclear, “appears to match the description,” the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
On April 23, Dugan declined to comment on the investigation or possible legal proceedings. ICE officials referred questions to the FBI’s Milwaukee office, which also declined to comment. The Journal Sentinel reported that an email sent by Chief Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Carly Ashley said that ICE agents came to the Milwaukee County Courthouse on April 18 with an arrest warrant. Dugan wasn’t mentioned in Ashley’s communication, which went on to say that ICE agents arrived in the morning, identified themselves to security, and went to the sixth floor where Dugan’s courtroom is located.
Ashley said that the agents were asked to wait until court proceedings were over, and that their actions were consistent with draft policies. Dugan responded to the email, however, saying “a warrant was not presented in the hallway on the 6th floor,” the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Instead, unnamed sources in the story said that Dugan didn’t hide a defendant, but rather took the defendant and an attorney to a side door which led to a private hallway into a public area on the sixth floor.
It was the third time since March that ICE agents arrived at the courthouse to conduct arrests. Two arrests were made in March and April, with one of the individuals arrested after appearing  in family court for a hearing on a domestic violence restraining order, which was ultimately dismissed. 
Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) said that Dugan acted in “defense of due process by preventing ICE from shamefully using her courtroom as an ad hoc holding area for deportations.” Clancy added that “we cannot have a functional legal system if people are justifiably afraid to show up for legal proceedings, especially when ICE agents have already repeatedly grabbed people off the street in retaliation for speech and free association, without even obtaining proper warrants.” 
While Clancy praised Dugan, Rep. Bob Donovan (R-Greenfield) said “I have never seen a more irresponsible act by an officer of the court, let alone a judge, if true.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_2397-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 18:07:37.271505

(Photo provided by Louisiana Office of Tourism)A nascent industry for buying and selling restaurant reservations could meet its end soon in Louisiana. State lawmakers unanimously advanced a bill Thursday that forces such trading platforms to officially partner with the restaurants whose tables are going to the highest bidder. So far, the trading has taken place without any input or involvement from the dining establishments.    
House Bill 90, sponsored by Rep. Troy Hebert, R-Lafayette, cleared the Louisiana House of Representatives in an 89-0 vote without debate. It seeks to ban companies such as Appointment Trader, Dorsia and ResX from arranging reservations through their platforms if they do not have explicit contracts with the restaurants. 
Hebert said he doesn’t want to ban the trading apps’ existence; he just wants them to get the restaurants’ permission before operating in Louisiana. 
Reservation trading platforms allow diners with hard-to-get table reservations to sell them online in auction-style transactions similar to eBay. Prospective buyers can also use the platforms as a concierge service, offering a flat fee to anyone who can secure them a table at a particular establishment. 
While the practice of paying for restaurant reservations is more common in places such as New York and Miami, the trading platforms came under scrutiny in Louisiana after the Illuminator reported on the high-dollar trades in the New Orleans market during Super Bowl weekend. They included a $2,138 reservation for a table of four at Antoine’s.
Hebert amended his bill on the floor, adding a provision that would allow the Louisiana attorney general to seek restitution on behalf of anyone who purchases an unlawfully sold reservation. Some diners are buying reservations without realizing the restaurants are not actually selling them, he said. 
Someone paid $2,138 for a reservation at a French Quarter restaurant. Should this be outlawed?

“We’re not talking about Chik-fil-A here,” Hebert said in an interview after his bill was approved. “It’s a select group of restaurants they’re doing this to …They’re profiting off of a restaurant’s brand, and the restaurants don’t even know about it.”
The bill originated from a dispute between online restaurant booking platforms — such as OpenTable and Resy — and the newer reservation trading platforms.  Hebert sponsored the legislation on behalf of the Louisiana Restaurant Association, which modeled it after a state law New York adopted last year with the backing of booking sites.
If trading platforms can secure partnerships with restaurants, they would pose a threat to the established booking apps. The trading apps make money by taking a percentage of the winning bid price for each trade, whereas OpenTable and the other booking platforms make their money by charging restaurants a fee every time someone reserves a table through their sites. 
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey said he is currently offering contracts to restaurants that will give them an equal share of the winning bids for every reservation. It would give dining businesses a new revenue stream from something that currently costs them money, he said. 
The viability of the reservation trading business model depends on whether there is genuine demand for seats at a particular restaurant or whether that demand is artificially inflated just to cash in on wealthy tourists. 
Hebert told his colleagues he believes the trading platforms use software bots to snap up reservations on OpenTable and Resy and then list them for sale on their sites. 
Hebert’s bill heads next to the Senate for consideration.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)North Dakota is poised to be the first state in the nation to implement a law that provides legal protections for pesticide manufacturers — an issue that has been debated in legislatures across the country in the face of large payouts to cancer victims.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Wednesday signed House Bill 1318, which specifies that a label approved by the Environmental Protection Agency acts as sufficient warning to users about the hazards posed by pesticides and herbicides such as Roundup.
Georgia’s General Assembly passed its version of the pesticide protection bill but it has yet to be signed. The National Agricultural Law Center has been tracking the status of similar legislation in Iowa, Florida, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wyoming.
In Iowa, the bill passed the Senate this year but did not have sufficient support to pass the House, House Speaker Pat Grassley told reporters last month.
Elizabeth Burns-Thompson is the executive director of the Modern Ag Alliance, a national group backing the legislation in North Dakota and other states.
“This law sets the standard for states across America to pass legislation similar to HB 1318 and, ultimately, stand up for our farmers,” Burns-Thompson said Thursday in a statement.

Ag groups have lined up behind the pesticide legislation, saying it ensures farmers will have access to chemicals they need to control weeds and insects.
Critics have said the bill will make it harder for people harmed by chemicals to win lawsuits against the manufacturers of chemicals.
Germany-based Bayer, maker of the popular herbicide Roundup, has been ordered to pay out billions of dollars to plaintiffs who claim the product has caused cancer.
The EPA has never determined that Roundup causes cancer. Plaintiffs have still prevailed, in part on the argument that they were not adequately warned.
Brigit Rollins, attorney for the National Agricultural Law Center, wrote earlier this year that almost every pesticide injury lawsuit filed in the past 10 years has included a claim that the pesticide manufacturer failed to warn the plaintiff of the health risks associated with the product.
Rollins was unavailable for comment Thursday, but wrote earlier this month that it was not clear how pesticide laws might affect pending lawsuits, which number in the thousands nationally.
Bayer’s website says it is also hopeful for a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of laws such as the one being implemented in North Dakota.
A Bayer executive said in an April 14 Wall Street Journal article that the company may have to shut down U.S. production of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup.
The pesticide bill in North Dakota sailed through the House of Representatives, where it was introduced, passing unanimously in January.

It faced more debate in the Senate, but was amended and returned to the House. A small group of protesters gathered outside the Capitol the day of the Senate vote, urging members to reject the bill.
Its second vote in the House was much closer, passing 51-40.
As the debate on the bill wrapping up, Rep. Donna Henderson, R-Calvin, said, “If we have learned anything, it is that we don’t know all the answers. We don’t know what this bill does.”
She noted that similar legislation has been pushed in other states.
“If it’s just a simple labeling bill, why did 35 other states vote it down?” she asked.
Leaders of North Dakota farm groups expressed their appreciation for the bill Thursday.
“This monumental step forward helps ensure our farmers have the certainty they need to make long-term planning decisions and stay productive in the field,” Justin Sherlock, president of the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association said.
While the debate focused on Roundup, the law applies to other pesticides registered with the state Department of Agriculture.
The North Dakota law will take effect July 1. If signed, the Georgia law would take effect Jan. 1, 2026.
Armstrong’s office declined to comment on his decision to sign the bill.

Mike Braun full control over the membership of Indiana University’s Board of Trustees.
The nine-member board serves as the governing body for the state’s largest postsecondary institution, overseeing major decisions related to policy, finances and leadership appointments.

That includes budget approvals, setting tuition rates, green-lighting new academic programs and deciding on campus projects. 
Most members are already appointed by the governor, but three are elected by university alumni.
If passed and signed into law, the budget would give Braun the power to make changes to the board’s makeup as early as July 1.
“I think it’s being done because the current process (has) not maybe yielded the proper results on the entirety of how you want that important part of our state to be run — from curriculum to cost to the whole way one of our flagship universities has been operating. I want to get a board there that is going to be a little more rounded, that’s going to produce better results,” Braun said Thursday.
“I think that we’re going to have a different configuration,” he continued. “That doesn’t mean that an alumni won’t be on it as one of the picks that you have to constitute the board. It would just mean that it’s not required for those three spots.”
Changes coming to IU’s board of trustees
House and Senate Republicans unveiled their 215-plus page budget compromise Wednesday afternoon. 
Amendments buried on pages 181 and 182 aren’t related to spending, however.
Instead, the new language stipulates that all nine members are to be appointed by the governor. Another section gives the governor authority to, “at any time,” remove and replace a board member who was previously elected by the IU alumni.
If the governor swaps a member out, the new appointee serves until the expiration of the term of the replaced member. Otherwise, any of the existing members elected by IU alumni are allowed to serve out the rest of their term. 
The bill sunsets those provisions on Jan. 1, 2028, near the end of Braun’s current term.










I want to get a board there that is going to be a little more rounded, that’s going to produce better results.


– Indiana Gov. Mike Braun


Other new rules require that at least five of the members appointed to the board must be alumni, and five must be residents of Indiana.
The provisions did not appear in previous versions of the state budget.
Mark Bode, an IU spokesperson, told the Indiana Capitol Chronicle on Thursday that the university “is currently reviewing the potential impacts of the proposed state budget” but did not comment further or specifically about the board of trustees provision.
The IU Board of Trustees and IU Alumni Association did not immediately respond to separate requests for comment. Indiana’s Commission for Higher Education (CHE) declined to comment.
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, R-Martinsville, said Thursday that “the concept of having elections where alumni choose is good, practically speaking,” but emphasized that “only a fraction” of the university’s 750,000 were voting.
“So, that’s absolutely not working the way I think people originally … hoped that it would,” he told the Capital Chronicle. “The governor has lots of appointments on the IU board and many other boards, and it just made sense to move back to that space.”
How trustees are chosen
Under current law, Indiana’s governor appoints five members to IU’s board and picks one student representative with the help of a student-led committee. Three other members must be IU graduates and are elected by other alumni.
At present, all serve three-year terms, except the student member whose term lasts just two years.
New budget language shortens student terms to one year and sets a three-term limit on appointed board members.
No other university boards were altered by the latest budget language.
How trustees are selected at other Hoosier colleges and universities varies somewhat — but like IU, others have also traditionally allowed alumni to have a say on one or more members.
At Purdue University, for example, three of the 10 board members are elected by the school’s alumni association, one of whom must be a graduate of the College of Agriculture. The governor appoints the remaining seven members, including a student trustee.
At Ball State University, an alumni council nominates two people to its nine-member board. The same goes for Indiana State University’s alumni council, which also gets two nominees to the school’s nine-person board.
Indiana AG, Comptroller want proof of no funds supporting IU’s Kinsey Institute

There’s no alumni input for Ivy Tech Community College’s board, though, which is made up entirely of gubernatorial appointees.
All 10 Vincennes University trustees — one of which is a student member — are also appointed by the governor: one of whom must be a resident of Knox County, and one must be an alumnus.
The governor similarly chooses all 10 trustees at the University of Southern Indiana, but an alumni “screening committee” helps pick one of the members.
In a Thursday afternoon callout, Monroe County Democrats called the budget provisions “absolutely outrageous.”
“This power grab doesn’t stop there — it attacks tenure, undermines faculty recruitment, and threatens the core of academic freedom,” the county party said in an email release, which pleaded for Hoosiers to call on their legislators in the final hours of the session and demand for trustee language to be deleted from the budget. 
“This isn’t just bad policy — it’s authoritarian, anti-democratic, and not right,” the email added. “This isn’t just an IU issue. It’s a warning shot to every public university in Indiana.”
It’s the second time that IU has been “singled out by the Republican Supermajority,” Democrats noted.
In 2023, Republicans opted to strip all state funding from IU’s Kinsey Institute, which studies sex, gender and reproduction. Its founder, Alfred Kinsey, produced ground-breaking research on sexuality, including the Kinsey Scale.

The event came two months after another event at which Abenaki leaders from a First Nation based in Quebec urged state lawmakers to reconsider Vermont’s tribal recognition process.

Photo by Jeb Wallace-Brodeur/VTDiggerMONTPELIER — Two months ago, leaders from an Abenaki nation based in Quebec urged Vermont lawmakers at a panel in the Statehouse to reconsider a contentious past decision: granting state tribal recognition to four groups based throughout the state. On Wednesday, leaders of those four groups — the Elnu Abenaki, Nulhegan Abenaki, Koasek Band of the Koas Abenaki Nation and the Abenaki Nation at Missisquoi — appealed to legislators at an event at the Capitol, too, and struck a defiant tone.“We know who we are,” said Don Stevens, chief of the Nulhegan group, during the evening panel. “We will never stop being who we are — regardless of what people do.”Wednesday’s event brought out about 100 people and took place in the same meeting room in the Statehouse as the panel in February. Among the crowd were members and supporters of the state-recognized groups and at least 15 House or Senate members. Lt. Gov. John Rodgers, the state’s second-highest-ranking official, also attended.Stevens and the other state-recognized tribal leaders urged lawmakers to reject the recent push by Odanak First Nation, the Abenaki tribe centered in Quebec, to revisit the state recognition process, which lawmakers created in 2010. They urged legislators instead to spend time advocating for their own communities’ needs and interests. The latest panel was hosted by the Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs,  the state-established body tasked with advocating for local Indigenous communities and making recommendations either for or against tribal recognition to state legislators.The state recognition process has come under scrutiny in recent years as leaders from Odanak First Nation and its sister Abenaki community, W8linak First Nation, have maintained that Vermont granted tribal legitimacy to groups whose members largely can’t claim continuous ties to historic Abenaki people, or to any Indigenous people.Chief Don Stevens of the Nulhegan Abenaki band. Photo by Jeb Wallace-Brodeur/VTDiggerInstead, the First Nation’s leaders have contended, many members of Vermont’s groups are appropriating Abenaki identity and leveraging state resources that they should have no claim to, and that instead could be directed to Odanak and W8linak tribal citizens.“It is imperative to correct the errors made and restore the truth,” said Rick O’Bomsawin, chief of Odanak First Nation, in a press release sent out Thursday morning in response to the latest event. “By accepting and promoting these unfounded claims, Vermont authorities contribute to legitimizing cultural and identity fraud, which harms the true descendants and guardians of this heritage.”The Vermont groups’ state-level recognition allows them to access college scholarships, get free hunting and fishing licenses and benefit from certain property tax exemptions. The groups also get some funding and benefits from the federal government, including legal permission to label arts and crafts their members make as “Indian produced.”Odanak and W8linak have federal-level recognition in Canada, which gives them access to relatively greater funding and other resources in that country, and, critically, allows them to claim pieces of land as sovereign territory. Both bands have reserves located northeast of Montreal, though also claim Vermont, among other areas, as part of their unceded territory.One of the Vermont groups, the Missisquoi, applied for recognition from the U.S. federal government in the 1980s but was later rejected, with the government finding that less than 1% of its members could show descent from an Abenaki ancestor. A Vermont Attorney General’s Office report in 2002 arrived at similar conclusions.One of Wednesday’s speakers — former longtime Vermont state archaeologist Giovanna Peebles — challenged those government findings. She told attendees that it would be “a grave mistake” to rely on them because they evaluated Vermont’s groups against a standard for historical documentation that, in her view, not all Indigenous communities can meet. Rather, “the indigeneity of all four state-recognized Abenaki tribes is solidly based on powerful family histories, stories and traditions passed along through families,” Peebles said, noting that she had spent “hundreds of hours” hearing such narratives directly from families in her career. “As archaeologists, we know that most of history was never written down,” she added.Margaret M. Bruchac gives a historical presentation. Photo by Jeb Wallace-Brodeur/VTDiggerMargaret Bruchac, a professor emerita at the University of Pennsylvania who is a member of the Nulhegan group, offered a similar assessment at the panel. Bruchac said that “the lack of trustworthy records obscures the continuing presence” of the groups in Vermont, adding that Indigenous families’ identities in the region may have been written down inaccurately by European colonial officials.  Odanak and W8linak leaders have argued, to the contrary, that historical records are critical to establishing ties to legitimate Indigenous communities — saying that they have never received sufficient evidence of that kind from the groups in Vermont.At the same time, research published in 2023 by Darryl Leroux, a University of Ottawa associate professor who spoke at February’s Statehouse panel, found that many members of the Vermont-recognized groups have little connection to Abenaki ancestors, and instead have French-Canadian ancestry.Some speakers Wednesday also drew a distinction between the history and culture of the state-recognized groups and those of Odanak and W8linak. The Elnu chief, Roger Longtoe Sheehan, said there are “Vermont Abenaki” and “Canadian Abenaki.”READ MORE
Referring to the panel earlier this year with the First Nation leaders based in Quebec, Stevens, the Nulhegan chief, asked lawmakers in the room Wednesday: “Why are we entertaining a foreign entity, in a foreign country, over your own constituents?” The first panel was hosted not by the state but by Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington. Headrick has since introduced a bill that would, among a handful of other measures, establish a task force to “review the validity” of the state’s past tribal recognitions.The bill, H.362, had a brief hearing in the House General and Housing Committee earlier this month, though it’s unlikely to advance further this legislative session.During Wednesday’s panel, several lawmakers voiced support for the state-recognized groups, including Rep. Mike Mrowicki, D-Putney, and Rep. Brian Cina, P/D-Burlington. The panel was moderated by former Craftsbury Democratic Rep. Katherine Sims.Perhaps the strongest comments came from Rep. Michael Morgan, R-Milton. “I was at the last presentation, if you want to call it that — maybe I’d call it a hijacking — back two months ago,” he said, before speaking about the Odanak leaders directly.“I don’t know what all their motivations are,” Morgan said. “But they need to leave people here alone.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Leaders of Vermont-recognized tribes defiant at Statehouse panel on Abenaki identity.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Abenaki-evening-9-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C711&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 18:07:37.271505

Frederica Wilson holds a press conference outside of the Krome North Service Processing Center on April 24, 2025. (Photo courtesy of Alvaro Perpuly with Wilson's office)South Florida’s U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson said she saw a “tent city” that could hold hundreds of people at the Miami immigration detention center on Thursday.
Following her visit to the Krome North Service Processing Center, Wilson told reporters she saw a structure that officials at the center told her had been built in 14 days to house hundreds of detained immigrants.
She referred to the structure as a tent city, but said the two-story building was made out of a harder material than cloth and that it had pipes for air conditioning.
“It’s going to get worse, so every time this facility gets crowded, in order to stay in compliance, they’re going to have to build another one, and it only takes 14 days,” Wilson said during a press conference following her visit to Krome.
“And so what they said to us was, as new detainees come in, they try to ship people out, but they can’t keep up with the pace because of the Laken Riley Act.”
The law Wilson mentioned requires immigration officials to detain immigrants arrested or charged with property crimes, among others.
More people could soon enter Krome following the launch this week of a large-scale operation to detain approximately 800 people in Florida in cooperation between federal authorities and state police, according to the Miami Herald.

Democrat Wilson, who vowed to keep visiting the detention center, said she hasn’t seen overcrowding. However, she believes accounts of detainees, their families, and attorneys.
“This is not my first rodeo. I was down at Homestead when the children were there, and I’ve been to Krome before, and I’ve been to prisons all across Florida, especially female prisons,” Wilson said. “So, I know what they do. They take them on a field trip, so you won’t see who is actually in there, but they did admit that they are building a tent city.”
Miami-Dade Mayor Levine Cava wasn’t allowed to join the visit, Wilson said. Cava requested a tour of the detention center in an April 4 letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
Groups such as Americans for Immigrant Justice and the ACLU of Florida have called out conditions at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, citing accounts of overcrowding, people sleeping on floors, poor sanitation, and two detainee deaths this year.
ICE did not respond to the Florida Phoenix’s questions about the structure and whether any detainees had been moved out of the center on Thursday.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-24 21:19:35+00:00,CT Mirror,Judge bars Trump from denying federal funds to ‘sanctuary’ cities,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/24/trump-sanctuary-cities-lawsuit-new-haven/,New Haven was among the plaintiffs suing over Trump's executive order barring 'sanctuary' jurisdictions from receiving federal money.,"A federal judge in California on Thursday barred the Trump administration from denying or conditioning the use of federal funds to “sanctuary” jurisdictions, saying that portions of President Donald Trump’s executive orders were unconstitutional.
U.S. District Judge William Orrick issued the injunction sought by San Francisco and more than a dozen other municipalities that limit cooperation with federal immigration efforts.
Orrick wrote that defendants are prohibited “from directly or indirectly taking any action to withhold, freeze, or condition federal funds” and the administration must provide written notice of his order to all federal departments and agencies by Monday.
One executive order issued by Trump directs Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to withhold federal money to sanctuary jurisdictions. The second order directs every federal agency to ensure that payments to state and local governments do not “abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
At a hearing Wednesday, Justice Department lawyers argued that it was much too early for the judge to grant an injunction when the government had not taken any action to withhold specific amounts or to lay out conditions on specific grants.
But Orrick, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, said this was essentially what government lawyers argued during Trump’s first term when the Republican issued a similar order.
“Their well-founded fear of enforcement is even stronger than it was in 2017,” Orrick wrote, citing the executive orders as well as directives from Bondi, other federal agencies and Justice Department lawsuits filed against Chicago and New York.
San Francisco successfully challenged the 2017 Trump order and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the lower court that the president exceeded his authority when he signed an executive order threatening to cut funding for “sanctuary cities.”
There is no strict definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE enforces immigration laws nationwide but seeks state and local help in alerting federal authorities of immigrants wanted for deportation and holding that person until federal officers take custody.
Leaders of sanctuary jurisdictions say their communities are safer because immigrants feel they can communicate with local police without fear of deportation. It is also a way for municipalities to focus their dollars on crime locally, they say.
Besides San Francisco and Santa Clara County, which includes a third plaintiff, the city of San José, there are 13 other plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which include Seattle and King County, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota; New Haven, Connecticut; and Santa Fe, New Mexico.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25113797609746-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 18:07:37.271505

(Getty Images)A child traveling through Kentucky was diagnosed with measles in March, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services (CHFS) announced Thursday. 
The child isn’t a United States resident, CHFS said. The child’s vaccination status and age were not provided. 
The child was diagnosed while being treated at a “health care facility in Kentucky,” the cabinet said. 
The case did not result in exposures for others, the cabinet said, because “the health care facility adhered to strict safety protocols.” 
This is the second confirmed case of measles in Kentucky this year. The first was reported in February in a Kentuckian who attended Frankfort Planet Fitness. 
Kentuckian has confirmed case of measles

Meanwhile, CHFS reports that amid “the largest outbreak of measles in the United States since measles was declared eliminated in the country in 2000,” not enough Kentucky school children are getting immunizations. 
“Coverage among kindergartners for the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is effective at preventing diseases, including measles, and is legally required for school attendance in Kentucky, has dropped to 86.9%, which is lower than the national average of 93%,” CHFS said. This is a decline from 90% in the 2023-2024 school year. 
Measles is extremely contagious and is spread through the air from coughs or sneezes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One infected person can infect nine in 10 unprotected people around them, the CDC says. 
Measles symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash. The CDC recommends the measles vaccination series at 12-15 months and then at 4-6 years old. 
“These are concerning trends that we are seeing,” Dr. Steven Stack, the state’s public health commissioner, said in a statement. “It is really important that folks are properly informed about vaccines so they can take safe steps to protect their children. Vaccines are safe and effective. We urge all parents to have their children vaccinated to ensure they are protected from preventable diseases like measles.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) A bill to create grocery reinvestment and local food processing grant programs advanced Thursday from the Iowa House of Representatives.
House File 1032 aims to help rural areas of the state retain grocery stores and expand local food systems with the goal of preventing rural food deserts. 
Rep. Shannon Latham, R-Sheffield, said rural grocery stores are often just “one freezer breakdown or one cooler breakdown away from having to close their doors.”
“This bill can help bridge the gap between local producers, processors and consumers,” Latham said. 
Through the grocery reinvestment program, existing or new grocery stores could apply for funds to expand capacity, upgrade utilities, purchase equipment or technology and cover professional costs. 
Recipients must provide matching funds and financial assistance could not exceed $100,000. Grocery chains with 10 or more stores would not be eligible.
The bill also creates a program for local food processing grants that would expand the availability, access, efficiency and capacity of local food processing in a community. 
The local food processing grant program would have $100,000, or 10% of the total allocated fund, annually to award to eligible local processing projects that source goods from more than one Iowa farm.
Earlier versions of the bill, House File 59, and House File 550, included an appropriation of $2 million, from the general fund, to the programs. 
This section was not in the version of the bill that passed on the floor. Advocates of the bill said they have been told by lawmakers that an appropriation is expected, though it likely won’t be the full amount from the initial bill.
Cynthia Farmer, Iowa policy manager with the Center for Rural Affairs, said the group is “excited” to see the bill advance and is hopeful for buy in from Senate appropriators.
“Although we may not receive the full appropriation requested in the initial bill, we continue to ask legislators to invest the $2 million appropriation,” Farmer said in a statement.

Amendments 
The bill had three proposed amendments, the first of which was introduced by Rep. Austin Harris, R-Moulton, to amend the definition of a rural grocery store. 
“The intent of this bill is to make sure that our rural areas, that are more prone to be food desert areas… are able to take advantage of this program,” Harris said. 
The amendment, which was adopted, expands the definition of an eligible rural grocery store to a business where 50% of the retail space, or 30% of revenue, relate to general line food retail. 
Harris said this would account for grocery stores that share space with other businesses, like a fuel stop or a diner, as is common in rural towns. 
The second amendment, brought forth by Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City, did not pass, but would have addressed the “real problem” of price discrimination by distributors who favor corporate stores. 
“For decades, we’ve had out-of-state corporations undercut local grocers — that’s the problem,” Scholten said. 
Scholten said it would stop suppliers from giving preferential pricing to established corporate stores over local grocers. 
“This will allow your local grocer to play on an even field,” Scholten said. 
Latham recommended a “no” vote on the amendment because she did not have an opportunity to speak with the office of the attorney general or other noted offices in the amendment. The amendment failed 58-31. 
The final amendment, brought forth by Rep. Chad Ingels, R-Randalia, moved the local processing element of the bill under the purview of the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, instead of Iowa Economic Development Authority, where the rest of the program is managed. 
The amendment would also prioritize funding for local facilities that process goods from three or more Iowa farms, participate in the Choose Iowa program or sell to a rural grocery store. 
Rep. Ken Croken, D-Davenport, said all of the amendments made the “good bill better and better.” 
HF 1032 passed with no dissenting votes and moves to the Senate.

(Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)North Dakota is poised to be the first state in the nation to implement a law that provides legal protections for pesticide manufacturers — an issue that has been debated in legislatures across the country in the face of large payouts to cancer victims. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong on Wednesday signed House Bill 1318 that specifies that a label approved by the Environmental Protection Agency acts as sufficient warning to users about the hazards posed by pesticides and herbicides such as Roundup. 
Georgia’s General Assembly passed its version of the pesticide protection bill but it has yet to be signed. The National Agricultural Law Center has been tracking the status of similar legislation in Iowa, Florida, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wyoming.
Elizabeth Burns-Thompson is the executive director of the Modern Ag Alliance, a national group backing the legislation in North Dakota and other states.  
“This law sets the standard for states across America to pass legislation similar to HB 1318 and, ultimately, stand up for our farmers,” Burns-Thompson said Thursday in a statement.

Ag groups have lined up behind the pesticide legislation, saying it ensures farmers will have access to chemicals they need to control weeds and insects. 
Critics have said the bill will make it harder for people harmed by chemicals to win lawsuits against the manufacturers of chemicals. 
Pesticide cancer claims at issue in bill headed for North Dakota Senate vote

Germany-based Bayer, maker of the popular herbicide Roundup, has been ordered to pay out billions of dollars to plaintiffs who claim the product has caused cancer. 
The EPA has never determined that Roundup causes cancer. Plaintiffs have still prevailed, in part on the argument that they were not adequately warned. 
Brigit Rollins, attorney for the National Agricultural Law Center, wrote earlier this year that almost every pesticide injury lawsuit filed in the past 10 years has included a claim that the pesticide manufacturer failed to warn the plaintiff of the health risks associated with the product.
Rollins was unavailable for comment Thursday, but wrote earlier this month that it was not clear how pesticide laws might affect pending lawsuits, which number in the thousands nationally. 
Bayer’s website says it is also hopeful for a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of laws such as the one being implemented in North Dakota. 
A Bayer executive said in an April 14 Wall Street Journal article that the company may have to shut down U.S. production of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup. 
The pesticide bill in North Dakota sailed through the House of Representatives, where it was introduced, passing unanimously in January.

It faced more debate in the Senate, but was amended and returned to the House. A small group of protesters gathered outside the Capitol the day of the Senate vote, urging members to reject the bill.
Its second vote in the House was much closer, passing 51-40.
As the debate on the bill wrapping up, Rep. Donna Henderson, R-Calvin, said, “If we have learned anything, it is that we don’t know all the answers. We don’t know what this bill does.” 
She noted that similar legislation has been pushed in other states. 
“If it’s just a simple labeling bill, why did 35 other states vote it down?” she asked. 
Leaders of North Dakota farm groups expressed their appreciation for the bill Thursday. 
“This monumental step forward helps ensure our farmers have the certainty they need to make long-term planning decisions and stay productive in the field,” Justin Sherlock, president of the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association said. 
While the debate focused on Roundup, the law applies to other pesticides registered with the state Department of Agriculture. 
The North Dakota law will take effect July 1. If signed, the Georgia law would take effect Jan. 1, 2026. 
Armstrong’s office declined to comment on his decision to sign the bill.

Senate Bill 25-129 builds on a 2023 shield law that protects out-of-state patients who come to Colorado for care and the providers who treat them. There have been multiple cases this year of states that outlaw abortion pursuing criminal charges against out-of-state doctors who prescribe abortion medication via telehealth. 
The bill allows providers to exclude their names from medication abortion prescription labels to protect their privacy. It also requires any subpoena requests to include an affirmation that it does not pertain to reproductive or gender-affirming care.
“There’s fear from our health care providers about being able to provide the best health care they can and use their skills. There’s fear from patients accessing care, especially if they’re traveling from out of state. There’s fear from parents and counselors. And we hope that this bill gives hope,” said bill sponsor Sen. Faith Winter, a Broomfield Democrat.










There's fear from our health care providers about being able to provide the best health care they can and use their skills. There's fear from patients accessing care, especially if they’re traveling from out of state. There's fear from parents and counselors. And we hope that this bill gives hope.


– State Sen. Faith Winter


Since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned of Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion, Colorado has become an island of reproductive health care as surrounding states criminalize abortion. In 2023, about 29% of people who got an abortion in Colorado were from another state, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. That share was a little over 10% in 2019.
Insurance for abortion
Polis also signed Senate Bill 25-183, which implements Amendment 79, a constitutional update that Colorado voters approved in 2024. It puts the right to abortion into the state constitution and removes a ban on using public funds to cover abortion care. Beginning next year, state employees and people on Medicaid will have the care covered by their insurance. Amendment 79 passed with about 62% of the vote.
“By signing these bills into law, Governor Polis reaffirms Colorado’s role as a national leader for reproductive justice and freedom,” Dusti Gurule, the president of Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights, which co-chaired the Amendment 79 effort, said in a statement. “But this achievement is truly a reflection of community power. Thousands of Coloradans from across the state organized, advocated, and mobilized to fight for these bills that allow them to lead safer, healthier, and more self-determined lives.”
Another bill modeled after federal standards for emergency medical care, including abortion, passed the Senate and has been introduced in the House but does not have a committee hearing scheduled. The legislative session ends on May 7.

The beleaguered Children Youth and Families Department and its embattled leadership are plagued with a shortage of foster parents and high turnover among demoralized, overworked and understaffed caseworkers, according to the blistering conclusions in a scathing report released today.
We know this is what the report will say for a couple of reasons. First, almost (but not quite) all of that is true. Indeed CYFD’s performance is every bit as awful as Torrez says it is. Second, it’s what scathing reports on embattled child welfare agencies all over the country always say, particularly when those issuing the reports show no interest in real solutions.
Real solutions have been in short supply in New Mexico. Instead, there’s an endless appetite for rearranging the deck chairs on the child welfare Titanic: Create an ombudsman office! Take the agency out of the control of the governor! Move some functions to another agency! None of that ever works.
Real solutions involve a single urgent first step: Viewing those who are investigated by CYFD and who lose their children to foster care as fully human — and worth talking to. That’s not for the sake of the parents; it’s for the sake of the children. Because it’s the families needlessly investigated and the children needlessly taken who overload the system. That leads to tragedies ranging from children warehoused in hideous institutions or makeshift spaces to children in real danger overlooked in their own homes.
It’s not easy to rethink the stereotypes. We know the horror stories about brutally abusive or hopelessly addicted parents; but they’re nothing like most of the parents caseworkers see.
In 2022, the most recent year for which data are available, 78% of cases in which children were thrown into foster care in New Mexico did not involve even an accusation of sexual abuse or any form of physical abuse. Nearly two-thirds did not involve even an accusation of parental drug or alcohol abuse. In contrast, more than two-thirds involved “neglect.” Sometimes that can be extremely serious; more often it means the family is poor. Indeed, CYFD admits that in 19% of cases, it took away children because of issues involving housing.
So it’s no wonder study after study finds that in typical cases children left in their own homes typically do better in later life even than comparably-maltreated children placed in foster care.
In part, that’s because of the enormous emotional trauma inherent in tearing a child from everyone loving and familiar. But there’s also the high risk of abuse in foster care itself.  Multiple studies find abuse in one-quarter to one-third of family foster homes; the rate in group homes and institutions is even worse. But when you overload the system with children who don’t need to be there you create an artificial “shortage” of foster homes — so more children are institutionalized, with all the horrible outcomes New Mexicans have seen.
At the same time, all those false allegations, trivial cases and poverty cases overload workers, leaving them less time to investigate any case properly. That’s almost always the real reason some children in real danger are missed.
Real solutions demand doing more to ameliorate the worst hardships of poverty, and providing families with high-quality defense counsel; not to get “bad parents” off, but to provide alternatives to the cookie-cutter “service plans” often dished out by CYFD.
But understanding that requires that first basic step: treating parents as fully human. Attorney General Torrez doesn’t seem ready for that. As Source NM reported:
Torrez’s agency is also calling on current and former case workers, foster families, and youth impacted by the system to come forward with information …
He’s right to do that. But notice who’s missing.  He expresses no interest in hearing from birth parents who have lost children to the system because their poverty is confused with neglect.  He shows no interest in hearing from the lawyers who represent them. He shows no interest in reaching out to anti-poverty organizations to ask them what they see when their clients interact with CYFD. He shows no interest in speaking to civil rights groups about whether they see all races treated equally when they encounter CYFD.
That’s a shame. Because, to paraphrase Torrez, I think we have all grown tired of waking up and hearing about another grandstanding politician holding another news conference to announce another investigation of CYFD that will solve nothing — because it avoids the problem at the root of all the rest: The only way to fix foster care is to have less of it.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CYFD2-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-24 17:07:56.867506

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A few months ago, South Dakota State Librarian George Seamon got an invite to a Pizza Ranch lunch with members of the South Dakota Library Association.
The invite had come at a trying time.  
Weeks earlier, former Gov. Kristi Noem had released a budget that would’ve slashed the State Library to a bare-bones operation. Were lawmakers to go along with the cuts, the lion’s share of the services that flow from the State Library to the association’s member libraries — interlibrary loans, summer reading program assistance, professional development and access to dozens of paid database services for use by local patrons border to border — would have disappeared.
‘After all our hard work’: Federal fallout leads to suspension of interlibrary loan courier service

But something else happened between the budget address and the Pizza Ranch meet-up: Seamon’s organization benefited from a groundswell of support. 
Dozens of libraries had shared news stories of the cuts’ potential impact on social media. Librarians had peppered legislators with letters and calls. Members of the public had done the same.
On Thursday, Seamon held back tears recounting to the State Library Board what had happened when he showed up at the restaurant to connect with some of those supporters.
“As soon as I walked in, everybody stood and clapped,” Seamon recalled about the meeting, which took place after the first legislative hearing on State Library funding. “And that wasn’t for me. That was for the State Library.”
By the end of the legislative session, lawmakers had reached a compromise to spare the library. Four employees would depart, and some services would be pared back. The library board — which had its final meeting Thursday in Pierre — would dissolve. But most of the organization’s services would survive.
Joe Graves, secretary for the state’s Department of Education and overseer of the State Library, worked hard to find that compromise, Seamon told the board. Lawmakers stepped in to back Graves’ plan.
There was a sigh of relief in the library community, but it didn’t last.
State Library faces Trump threat to federal funding after escaping the Noem knife

The path forward had protected enough state funding to preserve about a million dollars in federal matching funds from the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS). But shortly after the legislative session’s end, President Trump issued an executive order designed to pare down IMLS to the greatest extent possible under the law.
Congress had authorized funding for IMLS grants, with enough money to extend the grant the State Library expected for this year. But some opponents of the executive order were concerned that staffing cuts at IMLS would make it impossible for the institute to process grant requests.
“We saw that light at the end of the tunnel, then we were let back down,” Seamon said Thursday.
But this week, Seamon got notice that South Dakota’s grant funding was on the way. The librarian told the board that IMLS had released half the money, and asked for documentation of the library’s operational plans to release the other half.
“Based on those assurances, I strongly believe that we will receive the second half of our grant,” Seamons told the board.
It hasn’t been easy to see State Library staff go, Seamon said, but he reported that each staff member has secured new employment. One will work closely with the library, as she’s taken a position with a nonprofit organization that creates summer reading program materials and helps disseminate them, often through state libraries. Another will work for the public library in Pierre. A digitization specialist took a job at a bank. 
One of the State Library’s longer-term employees will retire. 
“I’m jealous, because I’m a lot farther away in life from retirement,” Seamon said.
He didn’t get a standing ovation from the dissolving board of citizen advisers to whom he reported those details, and details on the library’s current culling of its non-fiction collection, much of which will become the property of the State Historical Society. 
Seamon and his organization weren’t spared from gratitude and compliments, though.
Lawmakers decline to endorse Noem-backed state library funding cut, school safety grant program

Board President Tom Nelson said the state should’ve thought more carefully before targeting an organization that runs “as quietly and efficiently” as the State Library. Board member Kim Borsch, a 20-year member of the local library board in Lead, thanked Nelson for helping her get onto the state board, then thanked Seamon and the State Library staff for the opportunity to peer under the hood of an organization whose work she admires.
Jane Norling of Beresford, the board’s vice president, lamented the loss of the board and reiterated Nelson’s hope that lawmakers consider renewing a smaller version of it to serve as a voice for rural library patrons.
Seamon thanked the board members for their kind words and reiterated his gratitude to Graves and the other departments that showed support to the State Library through the “emotional ride” of the past five months.
He added, “It’s definitely something I don’t want to go through again.”
The future of the State Library is not assured, however. In 2018, during Trump’s first term in office, Congress authorized grant funding for IMLS through the end of September 2025. Its members will soon need to decide whether to authorize another round of the grant funding that props up state libraries across the U.S.

(Aidan Cornue | West Virginia Watch)The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia filed a lawsuit Thursday on behalf of a West Virginia University student whose visa the Trump administration revoked. 
The ACLU-WV filed the suit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia. The complaint names Kristi Noem, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Todd Lyons, acting director of the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. 
According to a news release, Sajawal Ali Sohail, a 25-year-old computer science student from Pakistan, received an email April 10 that his visa had been revoked because he appeared in a criminal database. 
Sohail was never convicted of a crime, the ACLU said, his family was actually the victim of one. According to the complaint, WVU police questioned Sohail in 2023 as part of an investigation into his tuition payments. Sohail’s father had been scammed by someone who offered to pay for Sohail’s tuition, but the person had used stolen cards to make the first payment. 
Sohail was initially charged in the incident but the charges were dismissed, according to the complaint. 
“Our client has been victimized three times now — once by a scammer, then again by police who incorrectly charged him with a crime, and now a third time by the Trump administration for citing that charge as grounds to endanger his legal status in the country,” ACLU Legal Director Aubrey Sparks said in a news release.  
More than 1,000 international students at 160 colleges and universities across the country have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since March, according to a report by the Associated Press. That includes students at colleges and universities in West Virginia. The ACLU-WV filed a similar lawsuit late last week on behalf of a Marshall University graduate student from India whose visa was revoked. A judge on Wednesday issued a temporary restraining order allowing the Marshall student to stay in the country. 
“We’ve heard time and again from the Trump administration that they only want to remove  criminals from the country, but we know that simply isn’t the case,” ACLU-WV Executive  Director Eli Baumwell said in the news release. “It’s obvious the administration has embarked on a policy of mass terminations regardless of the facts. We look forward to a court’s ruling on Mr. Sohail’s case.” 
Sohail, who would be set to graduate next month, said he still wants to pursue job opportunities in the United States. 
“This has been an incredibly stressful time for me,” he said in a news release. “I am losing my hair due to stress, I could not sleep in my own house for fear of getting arrested and deported. I am a good student from a good family, and I don’t deserve this.
“All my family and I have wanted since day one is to do everything the right way, the legal way, and I just want to complete my degree here in the U.S,” he said.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC_2277-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 17:07:56.867506

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Maine Sen. Stacy Brenner introduced a bill during a public hearing Thursday that would allow the state to better financially support farmers during unexpected events and emergencies. 
“This is not a hypothetical concern,” Brenner (D-Cumberland) told the Legislature’s Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee. “Farmers across Maine are facing unprecedented challenges from increasing erratic and extreme weather to the uncertainty of federal support.”
Brenner’s bill, LD 1605, comes after more than 100 farmers and supporters — including U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree — paraded through Augusta last week to protest federal cuts to agricultural grants and programs. In recent weeks, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has cut several programs that have provided millions of dollars and critical support to Maine farms.
Just last week, the federal agency ended the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program, which has provided over $477 million to help Maine farms subsidize projects focused on integrating climate-smart agriculture and forestry practices. 
A cost-sharing program that helps integrate conservation practices into working lands is also under threat as the Trump administration has tried to freeze one of its funding sources: the Inflation Reduction Act.
Beyond these sizable cuts, Maine farmers have expressed concern over President Donald Trump’s back and forth on tariffs that they say could eat away at their already thin profit margins.

LD 1605 would allow the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to use one of its existing funds to grant zero-interest loans to farmers in the event of a disaster or loss of funds due to federal cuts. The proposal is co-sponsored by Republicans and Democrats in both chambers. 
“This is smart, targeted investment in rural resilience, food security and the future of Maine’s agriculture,” said Brenner, who also serves as president and CEO of Maine Farmland Trust and owns Broadturn Farm in Scarborough.
The department is in favor of the bill because it currently lacks a mechanism to distribute rapid emergency funds, said Director Megan Patterson. She told the committee that this legislation could offer that “crucial bridge funding” for farmers during unpredictable times. 
An original version of this bill sought to include food banks, which have also been hit by federal cuts to a program that would have provided $1.25 million to Maine over the next three years for food banks to source fresh produce from local growers. Brenner said she decided to move forward with a proposal that utilized existing funding levers and had to make the hard choice to leave food banks out. 
Good Shepherd Food Bank said it supports the bill even with the changes because of its strong partnership with Maine’s farming community.
Maine Farmland Trust and the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association also both spoke in support of the bill.

(Mark Cornelison/Administrative Office of the Courts) A state law limiting the power of Jefferson County’s elected school board will get a second look from the Kentucky Supreme Court, thanks to its newest member.
In a 4-3 order Thursday, the court granted the school board’s request for a rehearing and withdrew a ruling it issued in December that had upheld the 2022 law.
The court also split 4-3 in December in support of the law which is written in a way that could apply only to the Louisville school district.
A change in justices accounts for the court granting the rehearing.
Justice Pamela Goodwine, elected in November, replaced former Chief Justice Laurance VanMeter who was part of the narrow majority that upheld the law. Goodwine is part of the narrow majority that now wants to hear more arguments.
On Thursday, Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman, whose office is defending the law, said, “We are stunned by the Kentucky Supreme Court’s ruling to undo its own decision. We will redouble our efforts to defend the interests of Kentucky students and uphold the rule of law.”
Jefferson County Board of Education chair the Rev. Corrie Shull said, “We appreciate the Supreme Court’s willingness to take another look at this case.”
In earlier rulings a Jefferson Circuit judge and the Kentucky Court of Appeals both found the law was unconstitutional. The lower court judges said the law violates Kentucky’s Constitution by singling out one school district for special legislation.
KY Supreme Court narrowly upholds law that singles out Jefferson County Public Schools

While the law does not mention Jefferson County by name, “the provisions plainly singled out counties with a certain type of governance that exists only in Jefferson County,” said the appeals court decision.
The Supreme Court disagreed, saying that the legislation is aimed at a class — county school districts with a consolidated local government — not a “particular individual, object, or locale” and that other districts could meet that definition in the future, even if it now applies only to Jefferson County.
The law’s limits on the Jefferson County school board were a priority for Republican lawmakers who are frequent critics of the Louisville schools and the Jefferson County Teachers Association.
Republican Senate President Robert Stivers praised the Supreme Court ruling in December, calling it “a shot across the bow to Kentucky’s largest school district, one which continues to fail its students, particularly low-income and minority students.”
Goodwine’s campaign last year received financial backing from the Kentucky Education Association and Jefferson County Teachers Association, which represent educators, as well as from Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s political action committee. 
Beshear had vetoed the law but was overridden by the legislature’s Republican supermajority.
The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case Aug. 6 in Lexington.

Brian Sandoval, who currently serves as president of the University of Nevada, Reno, is one of 435 university and college presidents and chancellors to sign on to a letter protesting the “unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American education.”
The letter from the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&U), which is clearly directed at President Donald Trump without mentioning him by name, opposes “undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses.”
The AAC&U letter, Sandoval said via email, “refers to the essential role that our colleges and universities play in our society in educating students to sustain our democracy, ensuring that faculty and staff have academic freedom and that our campuses in general remain places where the individual freedoms of all people are not curtailed or used as a means for punishment.”
The message also “affirms the multitude of benefits that further all segments of our world through the work that comes from public research funding,” Sandoval said. 
Last week, Trump froze $2.2 billion in research funding designated for Harvard University, which refused to capitulate to the president’s political demands, “including federal audits of Harvard’s programs, agreements to screen international students for their beliefs, and the installation of administrators who will ensure the White House’s demands are carried out,” the Harvard Crimson reported. Harvard is suing the Trump administration.
And earlier this week Trump signed a slew of executive orders on education, including one that aims to “overhaul” college accreditation. 
During his presidential campaign, Trump pledged to fire “radical Left accreditors,” claiming they “have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist Maniacs and lunatics.”
“We are open to constructive reform and do not oppose legitimate government oversight,” says the AAC&U letter. “However, we must oppose undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses. We will always seek effective and fair financial practices, but we must reject the coercive use of public research funding.”
Four Nevada institutions – UNR, the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV), Nevada State University (NSU), and the College of Southern Nevada (CSN) – are members of AAC&U. 
As of Wednesday, NSU President DeRionne Pollard had not been asked to sign the letter, according to a spokesperson, who says Pollard is “in the process of reviewing the public statement.”

Douglas Burns, former co-owner of an Iowa newspaper that was nearly bankrupted by such a lawsuit celebrated the bill’s passage.
“This is a big day for Iowa, it’s a big day for democracy, it’s a big day for community newspapers,” Burns said in an interview. “And most of all, it’s a big day for the truth.”
House File 472 deals with “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” or SLAPP lawsuits, a term referring to civil lawsuits filed by organizations, businesses or individuals against news organizations or activists because they have published articles or made statements about a topic the plaintiff does not want them to publicize. The entities filing these lawsuits do not necessarily expect to win in court, but aim to stop individuals or groups from continuing to report or talk about the topic by engaging them in a legal battle that costs them significant time and money.
The issue came to Iowa lawmakers’ attention when a Carroll police officer sued the Carroll Times Herald in 2018 for reporting that he had sexual relationships with teenagers, which the officer had confirmed was true. The judge dismissed the lawsuit, but the legal fees, totaling more than $100,000, nearly caused the paper to go out of business.
The bill seeks to prevent similar situations by allowing courts to grant expedited relief in cases involving First Amendment rights, including freedoms of speech and press.
As of January 2025, 35 states and the District of Columbia have similar anti-SLAPP laws in place. Rep. Steve Holt, R-Denison, has been the main proponent of Iowa joining these states. During floor debate on the bill Thursday, he said he began having conversations about anti-SLAPP legislation in 2018.
“This is the fourth or fifth time we’ve passed anti-SLAPP legislation,” Holt said. “… We passed this numerous times, never advanced in the Senate. This year, it did advance in the Senate.”
The measure came back to the House with an amendment removing the ability to grant expedited relief for a “cause of action asserted in a civil action.” The amendment striking this provision would mean anti-SLAPP protections cannot be applied retroactively, a situation Holt said rarely occurs.
“This amendment really does nothing in terms of the fact that were this to be signed into law, it will be on the books going forward, which will be … a tremendous victory in trying to protect our small town newspapers and media outlets from being put out of business,” Holt said.
The amendment was approved unanimously, and goes to Gov. Kim Reynolds for final approval.
Holt said he corresponded with Burns, the former co-owner of the Carroll Times Herald, who he said “spent $140,000 defending himself in court after telling the truth and basically lost his newspaper as a result,” about the bill earlier Thursday.
Speaking with the Iowa Capital Dispatch, Burns said the bill’s passage “proves that the ashes of a business can be the foundation for something durable and meaningful in Iowa.”
He thanked Holt for his “tenacity and determination” in advocating for the bill for years in the Legislature, and praised the bill’s passage with bipartisan support.
“It just shows that sometimes the truth can be apparent to all, and the truth can prevail,” Burns said. “With this legislation in place, assuming the governor will sign it, it should secure more truthful outcomes to a variety of stories and scenarios in our state for generations.”

Laura Kelly on Thursday signed legislation consolidating the state’s early childhood services under one department and supporting creation of more child care openings.
“When I ran for governor in 2018, I often said that, should I leave a legacy, I wanted to leave behind the most comprehensive early childhood system in the nation, so that our children, their families, our businesses and our communities could thrive,” Kelly told a crowd gathered at the Kansas Children’s Discovery Center in Topeka.
Kelly signed House Bill 2045, which creates the Office of Early Childhood, effectively consolidating more than 20 Kansas programs having to do with children, child care and other issues under one banner. In addition, the bill is expected to increase availability of much-needed child care slots, although critics have voiced concerns that it softened licensure requirements. 
The bill allows fewer education requirements for some workers in a child care facility and changes ratios of the number of adults to children. It also matches vaccination requirements to those currently in place for children attending school.
Rep. Kirk Haskins, a Topeka Democrat, said he worked on the bill for three years and that the final product, while not without its costs, was effective and good. 
“We do have a day care gap that we have to address,” he said. “But we have to be careful to make sure we’re not changing so much that it harms our children.”
Kelly said some concerns raised about the bill were misguided because people didn’t understand that much of the language included in HB 2045 was already in statute elsewhere. 
“Some of the concerns, like the wording on certain provisions within that, those are things that were already in statute,” she said. “They were just sort of put into the child care conversation, but were already existing. But I felt very comfortable that what we ended up with addressed a lot of concerns.”
Kelly said objections to the vaccination language in HB 2045 was one of those misunderstood issues. 
“That language already exists in state law, and we just put it into child care regulations,” she said.

Sen. Tory Marie Blew, a Great Bend Republican, spoke to the crowd while holding her 11-month-old daughter, Brynn. She said she and her husband put their names on a child care wait list in 2020, and then it took them longer than expected to have a child. A spot didn’t come open until just after their daughter was born in May 2024, she said. 
“Many folks are not working because either they can’t afford it or they don’t have access to it,” Blew said. “The thing about child care is it’s an issue across every state. Hopefully more states will look to Kansas on what we’re doing here.”
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes, D-Lenexa, equated the legislation to a promise to Kansas families. 
“By establishing the Kansas Office of Early Childhood, this bill takes a transformative step toward making child care in Kansas more accessible, more affordable and more effective,” she said.
“Kansas will now have a centralized, accountable agency with an executive director focused entirely on those early childhood services,” Sykes added. “This means more coordination, less confusion and better results.”
Kelly said it had been clear for some time that the current system in Kansas wasn’t meeting the needs of providers, communities and businesses. This legislation ensures a stronger, more comprehensive and flexible system for providers, she said. 
“We know the earliest years of childhood are crucial in determining the trajectory of one’s entire life, including economic health and social outcomes,” Kelly said. “A robust, flourishing early childhood system not only benefits our children, but it’s also critical to our state’s economic growth and well-being.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/4-24-25-Kelly-HB2045-1024x745.jpg,,,2025-04-24 17:07:56.867506

(John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Hecklers interrupted a speech Thursday by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at a conference on opioid addiction in Nashville.
The Rx and Illicit Drug Summit 2025 drew law enforcement officials, addiction prevention counselors, social workers and public health officers to the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center for the three-day event.
For years, Kennedy has drawn ire and disapproval for his anti-vaccine messages and, more recently, for belittling comments about people with autism and budget cuts in his department.
“Believe science!,” shouted a protester before security rushed him from the room. Another protester held aloft a sign that read, “Vaccines save lives.”
Kennedy’s speech was apolitical and focused on his own history in recovery from an addiction to heroin and his recommendations for dealing with the nation’s opioid crisis — many of which focused less on medical or treatment solutions and more on the need to build community, embrace spirituality and take personal responsibility.
After touting a $4 billion budget at HHS, Kennedy said that “money alone won’t fix this.”
“We have a whole generation of children who have lost faith in our country and their future,” Kennedy said. “Policy should reestablish hope for the future.”

Pleus, who came to Nashville with other members of a group called Moms United to End the War on Drugs, lost her son to a drug overdose and said budget cuts at HHS spurred her attendance.

The Trump administration — and Kennedy — have proposed to restructure HHS, including dismantling the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), cutting research funding and funding for addiction treatment and mental health care.
“All these changes are impacting people on the ground,” Pleus said. “People who are struggling with addiction can’t get help already and now they’re going to have an even harder time.”
The conference was sponsored by HMP Global, which provides continuing medical education.
Past speakers have included former Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. President Donald Trump spoke to the group in 2019 during his first term in office.
In addition to Kennedy, 2025 speakers included U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Tennessee senior U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn and Dr. Ralph Alvarado, commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Health.

File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThis story by John Lippman was first published in the Valley News on April 20.CHELSEA — A 74-year-old Newbury man who shot and killed his 38-year-old daughter when she came to his home for a welfare check has been found insane and will not stand trial.James Perry is “not guilty by reason of insanity” following a psychiatric evaluation, according to a court order by Judge Daniel Richardson in Orange County Superior Court. Doctors concluded that Perry was “floridly psychotic with paranoid delusions and hallucinations” when he shot his daughter at point-blank range with a shotgun four years ago.Upon review of Perry’s psychiatric evaluation, the judge on April 4 said the conclusions met the defendant’s burden to show that at the time of shooting he “lacked the capacity” to understand the criminality of act and that Perry was suffering from a “paranoid and psychotic state.”Perry was charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and reckless endangerment for shooting his daughter, Karina Rheaume, on May 3, 2021, at his home on Deerfield Lane in Newbury.She had come to visit with cookies to check on his well-being.Rheaume’s boyfriend later called police to report that when he went to Perry’s home after she did not return from the visit that Perry had pointed a rifle at him and told him Rheaume was dead. He told the boyfriend “if he took one step closer, he’d be dead, too,” according to a police affidavit.Following his arrest, Perry was diagnosed with mental delusions lasting longer than a month but he nonetheless was deemed competent to stand trial, with a court-appointed psychiatrist concluding that he had the “capacity to assist … in the preparation of a defense.”Perry’s attorneys retained the right to hire their own forensic examiner to assess his mental health under an insanity defense. It was that second evaluation — with which both defense attorneys and prosecutors stipulated they agreed — that the judge relied upon in his ruling earlier this month.A self-employed carpenter, Perry’s family is well-known in the Newbury and Bradford area, including owning the Perry’s Oil Fuel and propane business.Perry never denied shooting his daughter, according to police and psychologists who evaluated him afterward.“In the months leading up to the shooting, (Perry) had become disconnected from reality and was occupying a paranoid and delusional space marked by hallucinations and disordered thinking,” Richardson wrote in his order.Although Perry’s psychiatric evaluation remains under seal, Richardson referenced eight “contributory factors” cited in the evaluation that led to his psychosis, including a long period of self-isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, malnutrition, hearing loss, a prior psychotic event, cognitive decline and “information reverberations” created by watching TV news of political turmoil, including the U.S. Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021.“The facts show that (Perry) acted out of a belief that he was being pursued for assassination by Seal Team 6 and his daughter was working in collusion to poison him and expose him to the assassins,” Richardson wrote.Perry’s documented state of mind at the time of the shooting met the burden of proof under Vermont law that he lacked “adequate capacity” to understand the criminality of his conduct or conform to the law, Richardson said.Perry has been held without bail at Southern State Correctional Facility in Springfield.The judge’s order notes that the forensic psychologist reported that Perry continued to exhibit psychotic “symptoms and issues” while in prison. Only recently, due to “several years of regular nutrition, the socialization that resulted from being lodged with other inmates and a regime of pain management have these mental illnesses begun to recede and (allow Perry) to connect with reality again.”Perry is next scheduled for a hospitalization hearing on Tuesday in Orange County Superior Court.The purpose of the hearing, which will be attended the county prosecutor, a representative from the state’s Department of Health, Vermont Legal Aid and the victim’s advocate, is to assess Perry’s current mental condition, treatment program and the appropriate place for him to reside.Depending on the outcome of that hearing — which typically comes in a follow-up order by the judge — Perry could face anything ranging from confinement to a mental health facility to release back into the community.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Judge rules Newbury man who killed daughter ‘not guilty by reason of insanity’.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/orange-county-court-2-20240822.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 17:07:56.867506

In this image, Lane joins with Blake Flanders, president of the Kansas Board of Regents, in a 2024 Kansas Reflector podcast interview. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The 2024 Kansas Legislature’s commitment to intervene on behalf of 33% of Kansas students not meeting fundamental levels of reading and to elevate literacy as an economic imperative throughout the state was celebrated as a bipartisan achievement.
There was $10 million in the state budget to develop instructional expertise through the Blueprint for Literacy. The idea was to enroll all Kansas elementary school teachers in graduate courses in the science of reading. Public and private universities would offer new classes to equip undergraduates with skills to implement a structured literacy curriculum useful to all students. The bottom-line objective: Significantly improve language arts skills of students in 3rd through 8th grades.
Senate Bill 438 roared through the Legislature on votes of 34-3 in the Senate and 98-22 in the House.
Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who signed the bill in April 2024, said the legislation placed Kansas at the “forefront of nationwide efforts to reform reading instruction.”
“By aligning the efforts of K-12 and higher education to train our educators in the science of reading, we intend to end the literacy divide for our students once and for all,” said Melanie Haas, a member of the Kansas State Board of Education responsible for K-12 schools.
Cynthia Lane, a member of the Kansas Board of Regents with oversight of state universities, said the Blueprint for Literacy would prove to be one of the most important bills enacted by the Legislature and governor in 2024. She felt so strongly about the cause that she took a job as the first director of the literacy initiative.
And then, as the 2025 legislative session unfolded, the Republican-led House budgeted $2 million in next year’s budget to the literacy program. The GOP-controlled Senate deleted that earmark by sweeping all House appropriations of interest earned on one-time federal funds. The state budget bill eventually passed with bipartisan support and signed by Kelly contained no new funding of Blueprint for Literacy.
That financial setback won’t close the book on Blueprint for Literacy — at least not now while the program remained in its infancy.
“The blueprint is not ending,” Lane said. “We’re not done.”
 In the beginning
Lane said several million dollars unspent from the original $10 million allocation would be relied upon to stick with plans to enroll certified teachers in a pair of three-credit-hour graduate courses on the science of reading. State funding was allocated to cover tuition costs of teachers in graduate-level courses and to provide each with a $500 stipend.
Kansas college students seeking degrees in education must enroll in two new courses in reading instruction. Those courses should be available this fall at seven public universities and at least five private colleges in Kansas.
She said the original plan to establish literacy centers of excellence at universities to bring instruction closer to teachers would be idled due to financial restraints.
The decision by the Legislature not to allocate additional resources for the Blueprint for Literacy was associated with skepticism the initiative had yet to show results or might not deliver on its promise, Lane said. Some critics of the Blueprint for Literacy also suggested it might be duplicative of a program developed by the Kansas State Department of Education with federal grants issued in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Under the 2024 state law, the Blueprint for Literacy would take all elementary teachers through a graduate curriculum to attain a micro-credential in reading instruction by 2030. Student academic goals in Senate Bill 438 would have 90% of 3rd through 8th graders achieving Level 2 on the state’s four-level assessment scale. In addition, 50% of 3rd through 8th grade students would achieve Level 3 or Level 4 on the state assessment by 2033.
“It’s going to be hard to do when funding is removed and teachers can’t get trained,” said Lane, who was a superintendent of public schools in Kansas City, Kansas. “This is about our children. It’s about supporting our teachers.”
 ‘Easy chop’
Rep. Troy Waymaster, a Bunker Hill Republican and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the $2 million offered by the House would have been derived from interest income on the state’s share of American Rescue Plan Act allotments from the federal government’s economic stimulus program in 2021.
Waymaster said the offer by the House was a reduction from earlier projections of what might be needed to operate Blueprint for Literacy, but would have made certain the initiative had financial support to continue on a limited basis.
He said advocates of the literacy program came to the Capitol to object to pulling the funding after less than one year of implementation. Critics of the Blueprint for Literacy countered the spending hadn’t turned the dial on student achievement in reading, he said.
“Senate pulled it out, because they had different ideas on what they wanted to do with the ARPA interest,” Waymaster said. “I also heard, around the halls, the results were not there. Some didn’t like it last year and, so, where we were at as far as looking at the budget, I think it was a easy chop.”
 ‘Eager, hungry, interested’
Molly Baumgardner, who championed the Blueprint for Literacy before leaving the Kansas Senate after not seeking reelection in 2024, said success of the initiative was vital to the future of Kansas school children as well as the state’s economy.
“We have too many kids in our state that can’t read,” Baumgardner said.
She said the $10 million originally invested in the program wasn’t available to organizers of the reading blueprint until July 1, 2024. A task force responsible for managing the initiative nevertheless meet program development deadlines set by the Legislature. Literacy instruction courses open to college students were in operation by August 2024 as mandated, she said. The state law had attached an unusual financial penalty for noncompliance — $1 million for three state universities and $500,000 for three regional state universities.
A Washburn University pilot program started in March to extend literacy-education instruction to teachers in Topeka proved popular enough to expand to three sections of 30 educators each, Baumgardner said.
“That’s how eager, hungry, interested our teachers in the classroom were,” she said. “There is tremendous interest.”
Baumgardner said the 2024 elections added members to the House and Senate unfamiliar with the reading blueprint. The compressed 2025 legislative session and changes to how the budget was prepared limited opportunities for literacy advocates to speak with lawmakers about how the state could benefit of additional funding, she said.
Baumgardner said she looked forward to sharing with the 2026 Legislature in January emerging evidence of how the Blueprint for Literacy influenced teachers and students.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/P6050104-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-24 17:07:56.867506

The man who pleaded guilty to a mass shooting in 2022 in Highland Park that left seven people dead and prompted the passage of a ban on assault-style weapons in Illinois, has been sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences.

Robert Crimo III pleaded guilty on March 3, the day his trial was set to begin in Lake County, to 69 counts of murder and attempted murder stemming from that shooting. His attorneys informed Judge Victoria Rossetti that he wanted to change his plea just before what was to be the start of a three-week trial.

Crimo was accused of firing into a crowd of people from a rooftop in Highland Park during the city’s annual Independence Day parade using a semiautomatic rifle equipped with three 30-round magazines. He reportedly fired approximately 80 shots in about two minutes, killing seven people while injuring dozens more.

Rossetti on Thursday sentenced Crimo to consecutive life sentences for each of the seven victims who died. He also received 50 years for the 48 counts of attempted murder to which he pleaded guilty.

Victims of the shooting include Katherine Goldstein, 64; married couple Irina McCarthy, 35, and Kevin McCarthy, 37; Stephen Straus, 88; Jacki Sundheim, 63; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; and Eduardo Uvaldo, 69.

Survivors and witnesses shared stories with the court during the sentencing hearing on Wednesday and Thursday, which Crimo did not attend.

The Highland Park shooting in part prompted Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker to call for bans on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines at both the state and national levels. State lawmakers took up the issue during a lame duck session the following January and passed what is now called the Protect Illinois Communities Act.

It prohibits the purchase, sale, transfer or ownership of hundreds of types of firearms that it classifies as “assault weapons,” although people who owned such guns before the law’s enactment are allowed to keep them if they obtain a special endorsement on their Firearm Owner’s Identification card.

It also bans large-capacity magazines and various kinds of firearm attachments, including those that increase the rate of fire of a semiautomatic weapon to simulate the rapid fire of a fully automatic weapon.

‘Venue shopping’ law upheld

The Illinois Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a 2023 state law that says constitutional challenges to certain state actions may only be filed in Cook or Sangamon County circuit courts.

In a 6-1 ruling, the majority overturned a lower court ruling and said the law did not pose an unreasonable burden to the plaintiff in the case, a gun dealer in Madison County, and that the state had a legitimate reason for consolidating certain kinds of cases in certain counties.

The case involved Piasa Armory, located in East Alton, which filed a suit in 2023 challenging the state’s ban on assault-style weapons and large capacity magazines.

Although the case was filed in Madison County where the store is located, Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s office filed a motion to move the case to Sangamon County under a new law the General Assembly had passed, and Gov. JB Pritzker had signed, earlier in 2023.

That law requires lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of a state statute, administrative rule or executive order be filed in the circuit court of either Cook County or Sangamon County.

Democrats pushed the legislation through the General Assembly in response to numerous lawsuits filed in multiple counties throughout the state challenging the assault weapons ban, as well as other cases that had been filed earlier challenging Pritzker’s executive orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The law was intended to prevent what lawyers sometimes refer to as “venue shopping,” or the practice of filing cases in specific jurisdictions where the political climate is such that judges and juries are more likely to side with one side of a case.

The law came in response to challenges to the state’s COVID-19 response, a state law ending cash bail and the state’s ban on assault weapons, among others.

These lawsuits – often filed in jurisdictions with sympathetic judges – became a way for some conservatives to make a name for themselves at the state level. Former Republican governor candidate and state Sen. Darren Bailey and former Republican attorney general candidate Thomas DeVore both backed high-profile lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of state laws.

“We conclude that the State has some interest in consolidating actions in certain counties, especially in light of recent statewide litigation asserting duplicative constitutional claims,” Justice Elizabeth Rochford wrote in the majority’s opinion.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahomans may get to vote to legalize sports betting after years of failed attempts to get it through the state Legislature.
A Senate panel on Thursday passed two sports betting bills, including one that potentially sets the stage for a public vote. 
The panel’s decision marked the first time sports betting legislation has advanced out of a Senate committee, said Sen. Bill Coleman, R-Ponca City, the measures’ Senate author.
House Bill 1047 would allow tribes the ability to exclusively offer sports betting with a 10% fee to the state.  
It would require a supplement to the Model Tribal Gaming Compact which gives tribes the exclusive right to offer gaming.
Through the compacts, the state receives exclusivity fees in exchange for giving tribes the sole right to conduct certain types of Class III gaming, including slots, roulette and craps.
Coleman said the measure could bring in $14 million to $142 million to the state.
In Kansas, sports betting last year brought in $165 million in revenue, he said. Kansas Lottery records show the state received about 10% of the total.
The measure passed the Senate Business and Commerce Committee by a vote of 8-1.
A companion measure, House Bill 1101, also passed by a vote of 6-3.
If the first fails or is vetoed by Gov. Kevin Stitt, then House Bill 1101 would send the issue to a vote of the people, Coleman said.
Stitt has said he would not support a sports betting bill that gives exclusivity to the tribes and indicated he would veto any measures.
“This procedure was used in 2003 when members did not want to take a vote on the lottery,” Coleman said.
The Oklahoma Legislature in 2003 put two state questions on the ballot, 707 and 706, to create the lottery. Both passed. 
The Oklahoma Lottery began settling tickets in 2005.
It has contributed more than $1.3 billion to education.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said he is not a big fan of gambling, but Oklahomans are already engaging in sports betting.
“And since it is happening anyway, we should figure out a way to put out the regulatory framework and do it in a way that makes sense, working with our tribal partners,” Hilbert said.

(Photo via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the State of Iowa) In the wake of a resident death caused by an untreated bed sore, an Iowa nursing home is continuing to accrue daily fines for failing to comply with federal regulations.
So far, those fines total more than $139,707, with an additional $2,200 in fines added each day the home remains out of compliance, according to state and federal regulators.
State inspection records show that in January, the staff at Sanford Senior Care in Sheldon, a 70-bed nursing home affiliated with the Sanford Medical Center, found that a male resident of the home had developed a reddened area on his coccyx, or tailbone. The staff failed to assess and treat the situation or notify the man’s family or physician — even after it developed into an open sore in February, according to inspectors.
The resident died on March 6. According to state inspectors, the immediate cause of death was MRSA cellulitis — a dangerous skin infection that stems from staph bacteria — caused by the open wound.

“There was bloody skin on both sides of the buttocks and continuing down it looked like hamburger,” a nurse aide reportedly told inspectors. The facility’s director of nursing allegedly informed inspectors that certain employees were disciplined as a result of the death, adding, “We are trying to do everything possible to prevent this from occurring again.”
Administrator Richard Nordahl referred all questions on the matter to Sanford Health, which then issued a written statement, attributed to Nordahl, that said, “Due to privacy laws, we are unable to provide any comment on this inquiry.”
No state fines were imposed as a result of the death, although the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing’s website indicated a federal fine of some sort was imposed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
When asked, DIAL initially declined to disclose any information about the fine and referred the Iowa Capital Dispatch to CMS. A CMS spokesman then referred the Capital Dispatch back to DIAL. On Tuesday, a DIAL spokesman said the state agency had conferred with CMS and had obtained the federal agency’s “permission” to release the information.
DIAL now says that after it was determined that regulatory violations had placed residents of the home in immediate jeopardy, a fine of $12,130 per day was imposed for the six days the jeopardy existed. The penalty totaled $72,780, but was reduced 35% by CMS, to $47,307, presumably because the home didn’t appeal the fine.
After the immediate-jeopardy situation was resolved, other issues still remained and so the daily fines continued but at the rate of $2,220 per day beginning March 12, 2025, according to DIAL. That particular fine will continue to accrue, DIAL says, until the facility “has made the necessary corrections to achieve substantial compliance” with regulations.
As of Tuesday, April 22, that $2,200 daily fine would have totaled $92,400. Combined, the two federal fines totaled $139,707 as of that date — although the second set of daily fines, like the first, remains subject to a 35% reduction if the home chooses to forgo an appeal.

Nobody was arrested in the course of fulfilling the warrants, which were executed in Ann Arbor, Canton and Ypsilanti, Nessel’s office said in a statement, which added that law enforcement forcibly breached the entryway of one home after more than an hour of efforts to negotiate entry.
The search warrants were part of an ongoing vandalism investigation, including at the homes of University of Michigan President Santa Ono and University of Michigan Regent Jordan Acker.
U of M regent says home was vandalized in an antisemitic attack using ‘Klan-like tactics’

“In all cases, the crimes were committed in the middle of the night and in one case upon a residence wherein children were sleeping and awoken,” the Michigan Department of Attorney General’s statement said. “In multiple instances windows were smashed, and twice noxious chemical substances were propelled into homes. At every site, political slogans or messages were left behind.”
Liz Jacob, an attorney at the Sugan Law Center for Economic and Social Justice, said in a statement on behalf of the TAHRIR Coalition, a pro-Palestinian group at the University of Michigan, that Nessel is aligning herself with the administration of President Donald Trump “to intimidate protestors and attack their constitutional right to freedom of speech.”
“Dana Nessel frames herself as a democratic bulwark against the Trump Administration, yet has demonstrated continuous collaboration with Trump’s federal government to repress the popular movement for Palestinian liberation,” Jacob said. “Nessel’s irresponsible conduct has already endangered Michigan residents, putting them in the crosshairs of the Trump Administration’s anti-immigrant and anti-democratic assaults.”
No charges have yet been filed as part of the investigation, which remains ongoing.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Two high-ranking state government officials are leaving to serve in the federal Department of Homeland Security under former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, and Noem’s successor has chosen a replacement for one of them.
State Department of Tribal Relations Secretary David Flute will serve as senior tribal adviser on Indian affairs for Noem, who now leads Homeland Security. Bureau of Information and Technology Commissioner Madhu Gottumukkala will serve as the deputy director of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. 
Gov. Larry Rhoden said the two played key roles in state government, saying they’ll “add tremendous value” to the federal department.
Flute is an enrolled member of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate and served as tribal chairman before he was appointed tribal relations secretary by Noem in 2018. The department works to foster relationships with the nine tribal nations in the state. 
Algin Young, who was appointed as the state’s tribal law enforcement liaison last year, will assume the role of secretary for the Department of Tribal Relations on Friday.

Young served in the Marines before working in law enforcement for 23 years with the Oglala Sioux Tribe. He was appointed to the liaison position by Noem, who alleged he “found himself without a job” for speaking up about drug cartels on the Pine Ridge Reservation.
Young said he’s keen to build relationships between South Dakota and tribal communities.
“As Governor Rhoden so often says, we must focus on turning challenges into opportunities,” Young said in a news release.
The current salary for the tribal relations job is $138,911.98.
Gottumukkala will remain BIT commissioner until May 16. The Dakota State University graduate was appointed to the position in September after working with Sanford Health. The bureau manages information and technology-related needs in state government.
“I look forward to continuing to protect and strengthen the nation’s digital and physical infrastructure at a time when it matters most,” Gottumukkala said in the release.
Interested applicants for the commissioner position can apply online. The job’s current salary is $184,805.29.

Patrick Morrisey | Courtesy photo)West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said he plans to call a special legislative session to address the rising costs of state employee health insurance coverage. 
Speaking during a press conference Wednesday, Morrisey said he’d bring lawmakers back to Charleston to tackle issues including the Public Employees Insurance Agency. 
“That’s important. I thought that would be best for a special session, to be honest,” Morrisey said. “Because you can bring everyone. You can focus it. It’s a complicated issue. We want to get it right. 
“That was kicked down the road for many, many years,” the governor said. “I don’t intend to kick it down the road. We have to bring everyone together, all the stakeholders: listen, learn and then you’ll be seeing some activity.”
Morrisey’s news conference, which he held in Wheeling, marked his first 100 days in office. 
More than 200,000 state employees and thousands of local government workers rely on PEIA for their health insurance. 
Beginning in July, PEIA premiums are increasing by 14% for state employees and by 16% for local government employees. Out-of-pocket and copay costs are also increasing. The agency will also raise premiums by 12% for retirees.
PEIA leaders have said that the rising cost of health care, particularly inflation for prescription GLP-1 drugs that treat obesity and diabetes, are a major driver of the rate increases.
Following the regular session, union leaders reiterated calls that the program be stabilized.
“It’s a good benefit. We need to keep it at a good benefit,” West Virginia ALF-CIO president Josh Sword told West Virginia Watch. “We also know that public sector workers generally make less than those in the private sector, and one of the reasons that it’s attractive, therefore, to work in the public sector is because you’ve generally had access to PEIA, which is a good health care benefit for the employee and their family. 
“You take that away, or you destroy a pretty good benefit program so that it is not what it used to be, then you’ve lost that incentive to attract and retain qualified individuals in the public sector,” he said. 
This year’s state budget included $64 million more in spending for PEIA than last year’s budget. The appropriation is in line with the funding Morrisey level requested for the agency, according to a spokeswoman for the Senate. 
Senate president Randy Smith and House of Delegates Speaker Roger Hanshaw were not available for comment on Thursday. Senate communications director Jacque Bland said Smith would not be surprised by the governor’s remarks indicating a special session, which Morrisey has talked about before. 
Ann Ali, communications director and deputy chief of staff for the House of Delegates, said Hanshaw’s reaction would likely depend on what specific proposals the governor has. Morrisey did not outline any specific ideas for PEIA during his press conference Wednesday.  
“Extraordinary sessions for various reasons have become commonplace, but Speaker Hanshaw’s response when asked for potential reaction or feedback to any general proposal from the previous governor was usually that the House would have to see the bill(s) for how that proposal would be structured,” Ali said. 
House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, said lawmakers need to go beyond allocating money to PEIA and consider structural changes. He said finding solutions should involve bringing various stakeholders together.
“We need to look at serious, what I would call long-term structural enhancements to the program to make sure that the promise that we made state workers many, many moons ago isn’t eroded, and we follow through on that,” Hornbuckle said. “That’s very important to me, from a state perspective.”
He added that he would have preferred that time during the regular session were dedicated to PEIA and not to vaccine exemption bills and legislation ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
“The priorities of the supermajority Republicans are not in line with everyday West Virginians,” he said.

Jerry McAfee during a Senate Rules Subcommittee on Ethical Conduct meeting for an advisory opinion regarding a possible conflict of interest concerning legal work Senate President Bobby Joe Champion did for Rev. Jerry McAfee Tuesday, April 22, 2025. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Senate ethics committee on Thursday recommended that Senate President Bobby Joe Champion in the future disclose “any appearance of a potential conflict of interest” to Senate committees when he chief authors a bill, following Reformer reporting that he’d spearheaded a lucrative legislative grant for a legal client.
Champion requested an advisory opinion from the Subcommittee on Ethical Conduct after the Reformer reported that Champion in 2023 spearheaded a $3 million grant to violence prevention nonprofit 21 Days of Peace, run by north Minneapolis Rev. Jerry McAfee, but didn’t disclose that McAfee was his legal client. Champion says he did the work pro bono.
The committee also found that Champion had no financial conflict of interest when he advocated for an additional $1 million in funding for 21 Days of Peace earlier this year.
Champion has insisted that because his legal work for McAfee was pro-bono and concluded just prior to the start of the 2023 legislative session, he didn’t need to disclose it.
The committee Thursday made no findings of Champion’s ethical conduct for his spearheading of the $3 million grant to McAfee’s group in 2023.
The ruling is unenforceable. Under Minnesota law, legislative conflicts of interest are narrowly defined and only exist when the official does something to benefit themselves financially. Minnesota’s part-time Legislature creates many opportunities for conflicts of interest, as most lawmakers have another job.
In a final written statement to the ethics committee, Champion said recent media coverage about him was an attack on his integrity.
“We have had media outlets go from saying there was a conflict of interest requiring disclosure without reading the conflict-of-interest statute,” Champion wrote. “Unfortunately, there has been loose use of facts that attempts to erode Senator Champion’s integrity.”
After the hearing Thursday, Champion criticized reporting about his connections to McAfee.
“I am always a high integrity person,” Champion said. “I’ve been a committed community person … I hope that when you all are reporting these things that you take a different approach.”
He disputed the characterizations of the $3 million grant to 21 Days of Peace.
“You report it as if there’s a direct appropriation that is presented and then we as legislators sign a check,” Champion chided reporters. “That’s unfair and that’s untrue.”
McAfee received funding through the practice of legislatively named grants, meaning lawmakers directly named the nonprofit in legislation. That means the nonprofit doesn’t have to go through an onerous bidding competition run by a state agency. The Office of Legislative Auditor has repeatedly found that agencies failed to provide adequate oversight for these legislatively named grants compared to competitive grants. The OLA has recommended lawmakers refrain from allocating funds through legislatively named grants since 2007.
Sen. Sandy Pappas, DFL-St. Paul, who chairs the ethics subcommittee, said that the committee’s guidance could be applicable for all senators, not solely Champion.
“If it’s of interest to the committee for us to reveal that we did some volunteer work, or we served on a board in the past, I think that’s a very positive thing,” Pappas said.
Senate Republicans Thursday attempted to remove Champion as Senate president, but Democrats moved the motion to the Senate Rules Committee for further consideration.
Senate Republicans also filed an ethics complaint against Champion, and the ethics subcommittee will meet on May 5 to discuss it.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250422_0180-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-24 16:09:13.400571

(Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Stadnard)Lawmakers in the Washington House and Senate have struck an agreement to provide up to six weeks of unemployment insurance for striking workers.
Both chambers approved Senate Bill 5041 this year to open the safety net program to striking workers, but they set different limits for the amount of time people could receive benefits. The Senate approved a 12-week limit, the House four weeks. 
Sen. Marcus Riccelli, D-Spokane, said the six-week compromise hits a “sweet spot,” addressing concerns from businesses while leveling the playing field for low-wage workers. 
Labor unions and Democratic lawmakers have pressed for the bill, arguing the benefits will help striking workers afford necessities such as food and rent when negotiating for better wages and working conditions. 
When the bill passed the Senate last month, an amendment that would have restricted unemployment benefits to four weeks failed by one vote. Then, in mid-April, the House amended the bill ahead of a floor vote to add the four-week limit. 
Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, has not publicly taken a position on the bill.
Under the bill, workers would become eligible for unemployment benefits on the second Sunday after a strike begins, plus a one-week waiting period. Typically, unemployment insurance is offered for up to 26 weeks a year. 
If a strike is determined to be prohibited by state or federal law, benefits would have to be repaid. 
Workers affected by employer-initiated lockouts would also be eligible for the benefits. Labor advocates point to lockouts as a tactic businesses can use to put pressure on workers during contract negotiations.
New Jersey and New York are the only states that provide unemployment insurance for striking workers.
Republicans opposed the bill. 
They, along with business groups, argue it could incentivize workers to strike and result in higher costs for businesses that could spill over onto employers not involved in labor disputes.
“If employers aren’t healthy, you don’t have workers and when we don’t have healthy employers, we’re not going to have a healthy economy,” said Rep. Suzanne Schmidt, R-Spokane Valley. 
The bill would also require the state’s Employment Security Department to submit annual reports to the Legislature with data on the prevalence of strikes in the state and the cost of benefits for striking workers for Washington’s unemployment insurance trust fund. 
If passed, the bill would take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, and is set to expire Dec. 31, 2035. 
Both chambers have to wait 24 hours before putting the bill up for a vote, which means it could gain final approval from the Legislature as early as Friday.

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)New legislation signed Wednesday by Gov. Kelly Armstrong aims to protect patients from care-delaying snags in the health insurance prior authorization process.
Prior authorization refers to when someone must obtain approval from their insurance company before they can undergo a procedure, obtain medication or receive some other health service.
The process allows insurance companies to review whether the service or medication is necessary for the patient. Insurers say prior authorization helps control costs and make sure that patients are getting the best care they can.
But some doctors, patients and advocates say the process can be misused in a way that prevents people from accessing necessary services, or that leaves patients and hospitals to foot the bill for expensive treatments.
Insulin caps bill headed to North Dakota governor

Susan Finneman, a Bismarck resident who testified in favor of the bill, said 10 years ago her insurance company refused to authorize medical scans needed to treat her spine infection, leading her to put off health care and for the infection to fester.
She ultimately needed spinal reconstruction surgery — which she said her insurance company took so long to authorize that she nearly had to reschedule the procedure. 
Finneman said she had to personally call the highest-ranking doctor working at her insurance company to get the surgery approved.
“It’s not right that people have to figure out how to navigate it on their own,” she said at a Wednesday ceremonial signing of Senate Bill 2280. 
The new law sets guidelines for how insurance companies must handle the prior authorization process, including mandatory deadlines for responding to authorization requests and requirements that denials are reviewed by medical professionals. 
The law does not cover all state-regulated insurance markets, according to testimony from Sanford Health. State employee health insurance plans, for example, are excluded.
Other sections direct insurance companies to publicize information about how its prior authorization process works, and to give advance notice to patients and health care providers when the company plans to change this process.
Andrew Askew, vice president of public policy for Essentia Health, said in testimony on the bill most large insurers in North Dakota don’t cause issues with their prior authorization procedures. 
But that’s not the case with every company, he said.
“There’s a lot of insurance companies that are completely unreasonable,” Askew said.
States try to rein in health insurers’ claim denials, with mixed results

In 2024 survey results published by the American Medical Association, 93% of doctors reported the prior authorization process had resulted in care delays to patients that posed significant health risks.
Doctors occasionally must provide an emergency procedure on short notice without time to send a request to an insurance company. The prior authorization process in those instances must happen retroactively. 
Askew said in some cases, the insurance companies don’t give medical providers enough time to send this retroactive claim and to supply the backup documentation showing the procedure was necessary.
When prior authorization cannot be obtained after a procedure is provided, the patient or hospital may be forced to cover the full cost, he said.
“That’s extremely burdensome for hospitals that are trying to make a margin, trying to get patients care when they need it,” Askew said.
The new law says that prior authorization may not be required for a patient to receive emergency health care. It also says patients and health care providers have at least two business days after an emergency procedure to notify insurance.
North Dakota House approves change to state health insurance plan

Insurance companies must also ensure that when they deny health care to someone, that decision is made by a medical doctor or pharmacist, the statute states.
The law also mandates that appeals to prior authorization decisions are reviewed by medical doctors.
In both cases, the medical professionals must have active, specialized experience in the field of medicine relevant to the health service in question.
Several other provisions in the law are intended to prevent patients from being abruptly cut off from their health care.
For example, the law states that if an insurance company changes its prior authorization coverage requirements for a medication or health care service, the change generally may not impact those receiving the medication or service until those patients’ insurance plans turn over. 
If an insurance company violates the requirements outlined in the law, any health care services under prior authorization review are automatically granted, it states.
A prior authorization decision does not determine whether the insurance will cover something. A patient can be granted pre-authorization for a procedure but then still have to pay for part or all of it, in other words.
Some insurers testified in opposition to the law.
Megan Hruby of Blue Cross Blue Shield testified that prior authorization only impacts a small number of procedures, and said the requirements would create more bureaucratic barriers, not remove them.
She said the law would also increase insurance costs for taxpayers.
Hruby noted that the Legislature’s Health Care Committee studied prior authorization during the 2023-2025 interim session and didn’t end up making any policy recommendations.
The law will take effect Jan. 1, 2026.
It also requires that covered insurance companies report annual data to the state related to prior authorizations, including the number of approvals and denials, and the reason requests were denied.
The statute directs the Legislature to consider two prior authorization-related studies during the interim legislative session.
The first will study prior authorization requirements under state employee health insurance, and how those requirements impact patients and health care costs. The study would the require insurance plans to submit data by July 1 to the North Dakota Insurance Commissioner detailing the previous years worth of prior authorization requests granted, denied and appealed. The data would also have to include why any requests were denied, and how many denials were reversed.
The second study tasks legislators to research ways to send prior authorization requests electronically, as opposed to through the mail.
Any policy recommendations to come out of the studies will be forwarded to lawmakers to consider for the 2027-2029 legislative session.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)When he was in second grade, Krystal Emerson’s son was physically restrained by a staff member or put in a small, isolated room at least 18 times over seven months during the 2023-24 school year at Ellsworth Elementary Middle School. He no longer attends school in person after the trauma of those experiences deepened his anxiety and emotional dysregulation, Emerson told Maine lawmakers during a public hearing on Wednesday. 
A mother of five, Emerson has been speaking out for months against the practices of restraint and seclusion, which can include immobilizing students, dragging them down hallways, and confining them in closet-sized rooms. These measures remain legal in Maine, but under specific conditions.
But four years after the state passed a law limiting their use, some educators and administrators are now pushing to loosen those restrictions in order to give staff more flexibility to address what appears to be an increase in student behavioral crises. 
Encouraging lawmakers to reject a proposal that would lower the legal threshold for restraint and seclusion, Emerson told members of the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee that her son is still reeling from his experiences. Even driving past the school building or hearing it mentioned visibly unsettles him.
“It broke me, and it broke him,” she said.
Districts, teachers back changes to law
The proposal before the Legislature, LD 1248 introduced by Rep. Holly Sargent (D-York), would make several changes to the text of a state law passed in 2021. 
For example, in the section outlining when a restraint may be used, the bill would change the threat level from “imminent danger of serious physical injury” to “imminent danger of injury.” 
Research suggests state not doing enough to help Maine districts manage student behavior

It also removes the word “voluntary” when describing how staff can move a student. Under the proposal, involuntary movement of a student would no longer count as a physical restraint that would need to be reported, according to Audrey Bartholomew, associate professor and coordinator of Special Education Programs at the University of New England, who said she was drawing from her experience as a substitute teacher in Portland-area schools in testifying against the bill.
Proponents, which included several teachers, administrators, and the Maine Education Association, the state’s largest teachers union, framed the bill as a minor but necessary change that will provide, as Sargent put it, “clarity and flexibility for educators.”
Teachers and support staff “are under siege from violent, out of control students,” said Rep. Will Tuell, (R-East Machias), who co-sponsored the bipartisan bill.
One district leading the push is MSAD 11 in the Gardiner area, whose administrators met with lawmakers to ask for the more flexible language, arguing it would give them more tools to be able to handle increasingly frequent violent outbursts. 
After consulting with attorneys from Drummond Woodsum, MSAD 11 Superintendent Patricia Hopkins told Maine Morning Star she was concerned by their interpretation of the statute, which they took to mean that school staff could only restrain a student if they are about to cause harm dire enough to send someone to the hospital. 
During the hearing, lawyers from Disability Rights Maine and Lives in the Balance, a Maine-based national nonprofit working to reduce restraints and seclusions, argued that’s an extreme interpretation of the law.
“That is a striking interpretation. It is not one that I have seen case law support, especially in Maine,” Disability Rights Maine staff attorney Jeanette Plourde told the committee.
“I have not seen that interpretation being followed by schools, by the mere virtue of the fact that we continue to receive calls from parents of children…who have been subjected to restraint and seclusion,” she added.
Ellsworth Superintendent Amy Boles declined to comment on Emerson’s testimony but said she believes relaxing the statute’s language will help protect her staff.
“Our staff are getting beat up on the daily now, and it is getting harder and harder to find people that are willing to put themselves at risk,” she said in an interview with Maine Morning Star. “Changing the language from ‘serious physical,’ which is very narrow, to a broader ‘imminent danger,’ I believe we’re supportive of, because we have to protect our staff.”
Ben Jones, director of legal and policy initiatives for Lives in the Balance, told the committee that the key to reducing violent events is providing school staff with more training to deescalate those behaviors.
A recent report released by the Maine Policy Research Institute about student behavior said fewer than half of the 3,400 educators surveyed reported receiving classroom management training. 
“It’s very difficult for me to understand why more restraint and seclusion would lead to more safety for either party,” Jones said. “But I’ve heard the pleas from the schools, saying we need something. And I’m saying that something doesn’t have to be more force. It can be more training.”

[…]","Mike Norton, right, tours a Citi Cargo facility in Eagan as part of a listening tour in Minnesota's 2nd Congressional District. Photo courtesy Mike Norton. Former Minneapolis DFL vice chair, prolific X poster and business owner Mike Norton is considering a run for the south metro seat held by U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, Norton said Thursday. 
Craig, who has represented Minnesota’s 2nd Congressional District since 2019, has been signaling a run for governor or the Senate seat held by Sen. Tina Smith, who is retiring at the end of her term. Craig has not yet officially announced anything but has said she’d make her intentions known this month and is in the middle of touring Minnesota congressional districts that aren’t her own.
She appeared to stop accepting donations on her CD-2 fundraising page this week despite her reputation as a relentless fundraiser, and a fundraising page for a Senate run appeared to be briefly live Thursday morning before donations were turned off, according to a Minnesota DFL activist who posted it to X.
“Congresswoman Craig has said that she will make an announcement by the end of April about her intentions for 2026,” a spokesperson for Craig said.
  A webpage hosted by ActBlue, Democrats’ fundraising website, displays “Fundraiser: Angie Craig, MN-Sen,” though the fundraiser is not accepting donations.
Since the district’s longtime Republican Rep. John Kline announced his retirement ahead of the 2016 election, the 2nd District has been purple. Craig lost in 2016 before winning narrowly in the Democratic wave year of 2018 and adding to her margins of victory ever since. 
Redistricting following the 2020 census made the district slightly bluer, but even in a good year for Republicans, Craig won by more than 13 percentage points in 2024 after staking her claim to traditionally GOP issues like border security and support for law enforcement.
Norton said the district’s changing demographics mean the area is now more blue than purple — and that’s why he thinks he’d have a good chance of winning despite more a more progressive agenda than Craig. He wants to legalize marijuana at the federal level, eliminate daylight saving time and expand public school programming, including making public schools year-round.
Norton isn’t a resident of the district, but the U.S. Constitution only requires residency in the state of Minnesota to be elected to Congress. Other candidates would surely accuse him of carpetbagging were he to continue to live in Minneapolis.
“I’m not going to pull a Curtis Johnson,” Norton said when asked about his residency, referring to the DFL candidate for the state Legislature who was ruled ineligible for office last year because he didn’t live in the district. “I think what matters to CD-2 constituents is that they’re represented by somebody that can be effective in Congress — and I think I would be highly effective in Congress.”
Norton has been at times a vocal critic of his own party, and resigned from his post as vice chair of the Minneapolis DFL in 2023, citing concerns with the caucus and convention process.
Norton could face a crowded Democratic-Farmer-Labor field. A website touting the congressional candidacy of state Sen. Matt Klein was briefly up recently before it was taken down. State Sen. Erin Maye Quade could also be up for contention, should Craig run for higher office.
Norton is the founder of a logistics company that has twice been named one of the 50 fastest growing privately-held firms in Minnesota. He’s also something of an internet celebrity for promoting Minneapolis, capturing scenes of the City of Lakes — always referred to as “lovely” in his X posts — while riding his bike. He’s attracted legions of anti-Minneapolis trolls but has also sought to build bridges, including a bike ride with conservative state Rep. Walter Hudson, R-Albertville. 
If Craig opts to run for Senate, she will face a tough primary against one of the state’s other top Democrats in Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, who presents a more progressive option for voters who are wary of Craig’s moderation. 
Ahead of any expected Craig announcement, Flanagan released a list of endorsements from state legislators in Craig’s district, including DFL state Sens. Lindsey Port and Erin Maye Quade, and Reps. Kristi Pursell, Jess Hanson and Mary Frances Clardy.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-24-at-2.35.18 PM-1024x610.png,,,2025-04-24 16:09:13.400571

Some former inmates said they fixed his personal vehicles. One even said she gave his wife back massages.
Read their answers below and read the full story here.
Some questions have been edited for length and clarity.
Q: Was there any point in your investigation when you felt concerned for your personal safety? Did any of the former inmates express concern about their safety as a consequence of sharing their stories?
Click for Mukta Joshi’s answer.
Almost every single former inmate we spoke to (except the few who were happy to go on the record about their positive experiences) were worried about their safety and preferred to remain anonymous. Especially those who still live in Rankin County. Keep in mind that the law is not kind to repeat or habitual offenders of any kind, and all of these folks had at least one felony on their record, making them very worried about getting in any sort of trouble again. 
We definitely noticed a culture of fear. Multiple male former trusties told us they try their best to stay out of Rankin County at all times. 
For us, it wasn’t so bad. I will say it was a difficult story to report, especially as the press is increasingly perceived and treated with animosity by public authorities that ought to be transparent and answerable to the people. But we made every effort to be safe, responsible, and most importantly fair to the subjects of our reporting. It definitely helps to know that you’re doing everything in your power to dot your i’s and cross your t’s.  

Click for Steph Quinn’s answer.
More than one male former trusty said they avoid Rankin County because they’re concerned officers will find any reason to pull them over – if they’re going 10 over the speed limit on the highway, for example. I remember when we asked one former trusty if he’d be willing to have his hands photographed for the story – keeping him anonymous, but still featuring a photo of him – he suddenly sounded so scared, and it really hit home for me the fear of retaliation that some former inmates feel, often after having really horrific experiences in the jail. Sometimes I imagine an alternate reality where it would be safe for them to openly tell their full stories – everything they’ve been through, how much they’ve grown – alongside their photos.

Q: In your article, there was a quote from one of the supervisors which claimed that they had no authority over the Sheriff’s budgets.
In your reporting for this story, were you able to review the specific budget documents, invoices, purchase orders etc? If so, whose name was on these documents as signing off on them being approved purchases? Is there any evidence that these purchases were made with seized drug money? If so, what would the evidence be for that?
Click for Steph Quinn’s answer.
I wish I had a better answer to this question! We had really, really hoped to be able to sit down with members of the Board of Supervisors and talk about the purchasing process, who from the Board of Supervisors has to approve what and when, and whether there’s a review process of sheriff’s department purchases after money has been budgeted for the department. 
In short, the documents we have don’t show anyone in particular signing off on purchases. And yes, there is clear evidence that some of the purchases – such as the skid steer that Sheriff Bailey allegedly stored on his mother’s farm that was used to clear land – were made with seized drug money. We know that because the sheriff’s department’s budgeted funds are in a different “pot” of money from seized drug money. We had to request the documents separately, and some of the drug seizure purchases are explicitly labeled as such in the description column for the purchase. We also confirmed about the skid steer with a source who’s a former deputy.
And we tried hard to talk with supervisors, to no avail. When Mukta emailed one of the supervisors asking for an interview, the sheriff’s department’s lawyer replied to the email, saying no one from the county would talk with us. We showed up in person to the supervisors’ office, called and even asked the supervisors for an interview during a monthly BoS meeting. The answer was always the same.

Q: Do you think it will be more difficult in the current political climate to hold Bailey accountable for his misuse of actual people?
We seem to be okay with some pretty questionable behaviors from government officials, and Bailey is still sheriff after several other heinous allegations have been made public.
Click for Mukta Joshi’s answer.
Don’t mean for this to sound like a cop-out (no pun intended) but it seems like only time will tell. You are correct that it has gotten way more difficult to hold law enforcement accountable as the Department of Justice under this administration has deprioritized police reform. But the response this story received from within the Rankin County community was something that none of us had expected. People seem really, really angry. And sometimes, that’s the best part of local reporting: even if it doesn’t trigger reform at the very top, it can change minds within the community, and that can sometimes end up being even more impactful. 

Click for Steph Quinn’s answer.
Quite possibly. There’s what’s happening at the federal level. The state auditor’s office has opened an investigation into the allegations from our story, but that office can’t prosecute. In addition to the allegations that the sheriff used inmates to work on the chicken farm, there are also the allegations that he used county property and resources, such as gravel and the skid steer, for his personal benefit. It’s possible that some of those allegations are more actionable from a legal standpoint than others, but I can’t really say. Time will tell!

Q: Were there ever reports of inmates being injured or ill after working for them, especially at the chicken farm? I cannot imagine and PPE being used and chicken barn dust is no joke. As an aside, it’s sad that the only thing the female inmates seem to be allowed to do is clean and office work. Did they ever produce the rules of the program for men or disciplinary policies for either sex? I don’t understand how you can have such a program without thoroughly planned out and documented policies.
Click for Mukta Joshi’s answer.
That is a GREAT question and something we will definitely start looking into. I will say, chicken farm-related  injuries and illnesses didn’t come up while we were reporting for these stories, but we did certainly hear that it was not pleasant work at all. It involved, like Christian Dedmon said in that text to his then-wife, being “covered in chicken shit.” Which I personally have not experienced before but does not sound fun. 
About the female inmates being relegated to cleaning (with the occasional exception of secretarial work) – man, we noticed that too! It was interesting because you would think at least partially, the idea behind working in jail would be to build skills for post-release life. And while the men had the opportunity to practice a bunch of different trades – which some of them continue to do in the “free world,” such as electric work and auto repair – some female trusties who started working after jail are doing just that: cleaning. Nothing wrong with cleaning, obviously, but it is undeniably very gendered work. 

Click for Steph Quinn’s answer.
Seconding that this is an awesome question. I can’t speak directly to the availability of PPE on the farm, but I was struck by how former trusties we spoke with sort of shrugged off the nastiness and difficulty of the annual cleanout. I can’t speak for them, but I think it points to the thorniness of trusties’ relationships with sheriff’s department officials, and how trusty work – even work that (allegedly) broke the law – could be a survival strategy for inmates. I think it can be true that trusties were allegedly being used for the sheriff’s benefit AND that being one of the most trusted trusties, who was allowed to work outside the jail under looser supervision, was desirable. One of our sources said something like, even when you’re in jail, there’s some degree of choice. Another source talked about wanting to impress the sheriff to become a “blue suit” – the highest rank of male trusties – and said that part of the reason he wanted this was that it could make his life in the jail easier. 
And I hear you about the cleaning. If I were a trusty, I would want to learn how to fix cars!

Q: Is it “trustees” or “trusties”?
Click for Mukta Joshi’s answer.
Thank you so much for this question – so many people responded to the story correcting this spelling and it’s great to get to clear up the confusion once and for all. 
In a nutshell: it’s “trusties,” with “trusty” being the singular form, in the context of inmates. Basically it means trustworthy. Think, “I drove my trusty car!” But it is very confusing, because the word “trustees” also has a similar meaning. We were thrown off by this too!!

Click for Steph Quinn’s answer.
This is a question a lot of people have had, and it’s a good one! Everyone we talked with says “trustees” (with the emphasis on the second syllable). So in people’s everyday speech, it’s absolutely “trustees.” And I think there’s kind of an interesting slippage between the formal, Merriam-Webster spelling – “trusties” – and how it’s pronounced, since in the financial world, “trustees” are entrusted with valuable assets. And trusties are, too. We went with the dictionary spelling because of our organization’s style guidelines.

Q: How long has this practice been ongoing in Rankin County? Did any other sheriff predecessor know or take part in it?
Click for Steph Quinn’s answer.
We focused on Sheriff Bailey’s time in office, so I can’t speak definitively on what happened before. We know that the trusty system is old, in Rankin County and across the state. After civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer was arrested in June 1963 for riding in the “white” section of a Greyhound bus in Winona, Montgomery County jailers ordered two Black trusties to torture her. In 1972, a federal court found that at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman, the use of armed “trusty shooters” to oversee inmates’ work in the fields resulted in dozens of inmates suffering gunshot wounds and beatings. And incarcerated farm labor itself – for instance, at Parchman Farm – was a successor to the convict leasing system, which sought to address labor shortages and reinforced white supremacy after the end of the Civil War.

Click for Mukta Joshi’s answer.
Also, former Simpson County Sheriff Lloyd “Goon” Jones, someone Sheriff Bailey considered a mentor, was killed when he was shot along with a jail trusty in his front yard.

Q: Have you faced threats of retaliation?
Click for Mukta Joshi’s answer.
Words like “defamatory” have certainly been thrown around, but besides that, not really. It’s our sources we’re more concerned about – many of them still have to live in Rankin County and for that reason were really scared to speak up. 

Click for Steph Quinn’s answer.
Luckily, no. Aside from the “defamatory” language, there’s just been unpleasantness and some foot-dragging on our public record requests. I worry about our sources, though! I have such respect for them for speaking out at risk to themselves.

Q: In this investigation did you find any additional info on Rankin County’s “goon squad”? (Not sure if that’s super relevant here)
Click for Mukta Joshi’s answer.
Short answer: Yes. Long answer: We’re working on it. Our larger team, which includes our incredible colleagues Nate Rosenfield, Brian Howey and Jerry Mitchell are currently continuing reporting on the Goon Squad. Brian & Nate’s work in 2023 showed us that the Goon Squad wasn’t limited to the 6 officers who got sentenced in the Jenkins & Parker case, and that it was going on well beyond those two incidents, for nearly two decades. Many people told us that it was an open secret. Which means that story is far from over!

Click for Steph Quinn’s answer.
This is a really important point. The torture and abuse that have come to light through our colleagues’ Goon Squad reporting wasn’t limited to the officers who are in prison. We can’t say much here at this point, but there’s a lot more work to do!",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/24090640/ama-4-17-25-ask-steph-quinn-and-mukta-joshi-about-their-v0-1oxrk40xz7ve1.webp,,,2025-04-24 16:09:13.400571

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Providence Democratic Sen. Frank Ciccone III says he’s seeking the Senate president spot as a way to pay tribute to his friend and “brother,” the late Sen. President Dominick Ruggerio.
Other senators say Senate Majority Leader Val Lawson is drumming up votes for her own presidential bid, with Ciccone as her No. 2. And Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, isn’t talking.
Amid much confusion and closed-door conversations, one thing is clear: The forthcoming leadership contest has deepened longstanding tensions between progressive and conservative Rhode Island Democrats.
Progressive group Indivisible Rhode Island is publicly urging residents to tell their state senator not to support a ticket that includes Ciccone in either leadership role, referring to Ciccone as “Trump Lite” in a post on BlueSky.
Meanwhile, even senators who support Lawson are reluctant to vote for her if she aligns herself with Ciccone due to his voting history opposing abortion rights, gun restrictions, and gay marriage.
Another option: Sen. Ryan Pearson, a Cumberland Democrat who already gathered the backing of one-third of Senate Democrats when he unsuccessfully challenged Ruggerio for the president spot during the party’s November caucus. Pearson confirmed his candidacy Thursday, but declined to comment when asked about Lawson and Ciccone.
“This is a time for us to bring the Senate together and have us work as a unified team for the people of Rhode Island,” Pearson said in a text message Thursday. “I am seeking my colleagues’ support based on my past record working with each of them as Finance Chair and Majority leader, delivering on their priorities and meeting the diverse needs of their districts.”
Ciccone also said he wants to bring harmony to a divided chamber. That’s what prompted him to start calling lawmakers for support on April 21, following Ruggerio’s death earlier that day.
“I even feel bad talking about this to you right now,” Ciccone, 77, said Thursday morning. “I don’t think we should do anything, make any statements, cut any deals, go public until after the funeral.”
Ruggerio’s funeral Mass will be celebrated on Monday, April 28. The Senate has been on hiatus since his death, but is expected to reconvene following his funeral, at which time a simple majority of the sitting 37 senators will vote for a new president.

– Sen. Frank Ciccone III, a Providence Democrat, regarding Senate leadership elections 


There’s little daylight between Pearson and Lawson on policy issues: Both support stronger reproductive rights and gun restrictions, champion education issues and want to strengthen the state’s health care landscape. But Ciccone, first elected in 2002, represents a much different brand of Democrat, making his alliance with Lawson surprising, and potentially, damaging to her candidacy.
“I like Val, and would absolutely support her on the leadership team,” said Sen. Tiara Mack, a Providence Democrat. Mack is the youngest, and one of the most progressive members of the chamber.
Referring to Ciccone, Mack continued, “But I cannot stand behind someone who is, in this state of the world, not going to give us a firm commitment to what 75% of Rhode Islanders believe we need: an assault-weapons ban.”

Gun rights under fire 
Ciccone is a licensed federal firearms dealer and gun rights supporter with an “A” rating by the National Rifle Association. He sells guns out of the basement of his Silver Lake  home, no more than one per year to “someone I know,” he said Thursday.
He plans to seek an advisory opinion from the Rhode Island Ethics Commission regarding whether his gun sale business conflicts with a potential leadership position in the Senate, he said Thursday.
Ciccone has routinely voted against stricter gun protections throughout his 22 years in the Senate, including the safe storage bill signed into law in 2024. And he doesn’t support an assault-style weapons ban, at least as currently proposed.
“The fact that someone owns a semi-automatic shotgun, or rifle they hunt with, or a pistol, I don’t define that as an assault weapon,” Ciccone said.
Companion bills introduced by Sen. Lou DiPalma and Rep. Jason Knight would ban the sale of various types of semi-automatic shotguns and rifles. The legislation also requires residents who already own assault-style weapons to register them with a police department, which Ciccone contends is unconstitutional.
Ciccone said he would be open to an alternative proposal that eliminates the registry and narrows the definition of assault-style weapons to machine guns, similar to what the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has considered as assault weapons absent a formal federal definition. Gun rights advocates expressed similar views during a March 26 hearing on Knight’s bill in the House Judiciary Committee. The Senate Committee on Judiciary has not yet held an initial hearing on DiPalma’s companion bill.
DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, said Thursday he was open to amending the language of his bill, including the registry component and the definition of an assault-style weapon.
“I am still focused on getting this over the goal line,” DiPalma said. “We need to get it done, and get it done this session. But ‘done’ does not mean the bill we have is the exact bill we are going to pass.”
DiPalma has decided, but declined to say, who he would be supporting in the Senate leadership elections. DiPalma had spoken with Ciccone and Lawson, but not Pearson, as of Thursday morning,
Listening to voters 
Ruggerio and Ciccone share similar politics, ages and union backgrounds. Their shared history spans four decades, dating back to when Ciccone was business manager of the Rhode Island Judicial, Professional, and Technical Employees Local Union 808.
The pair would bicker constantly — just like brothers —  Ciccone said, but always worked it out in the end.
Ciccone, who chairs the Senate Committee on Labor and Gaming, said his union experience translated well to Smith Hill.
“You have to listen to everyone, hear them out, and try to work out an agreement,” Ciccone said. “I enjoy the fact everybody [in the Senate] has a different opinion. They represent different constituencies.”
Ciccone cited his constituents’ viewpoints as the reason why he voted against legalizing gay marriage in 2010. 
“I represent a district with five Catholic churches and a large Hispanic population,” Ciccone said. “They were not in favor of it. What do I do? Go against my constituents?”
Little comfort to Sen. Meghan Kallman, a Pawtucket Democrat. 
“As a member of the LGBTQ caucus, I cannot vote for someone who is not in full-throated support of the rights of my community,” Kallman said in an interview Thursday.
Ciccone also opposed the state’s 2019 law codifying Roe V. Wade, and the 2023 law expanding insurance coverage for abortion access. 
“That issue has come and went and now it’s decided,” he said.
Ciccone is a co-sponsor on a Republican-backed proposal introduced this year that would repeal the state’s 2021 Act on Climate Law, which set decarbonization mandates with the goal of reaching net-zero by 2050.
Ciccone said the purpose of his support was to “start a discussion” around the state’s ability to meet the incremental decarbonization benchmarks laid out in the existing law.
“I want to be realistic,” Ciccone said, who voted in favor of the original bill in 2021.
But Kallman called Act on Climate “the single-most important and ambitious piece of legislation” passed since she was elected in 2020.
“The Act on Climate is key to my generation and anyone younger than me being able to survive,” she said. 
Rebuilding the bench
Kallman, 41, and Mack, 31, both pushed for new blood in leadership — in age and political philosophy.
“We need a Senate chamber that is also going to have a bold vision, maybe not the boldest, but someone who’s not going to just copy and paste what our Senate president did,” Mack said.

– Sen. Tiara Mack, a Providence Democrat and co-chair of the Rhode Island Black, Latino, Indigenous, Asian-American and Pacific-Islander Caucus


Mack, who co-chairs the Rhode Island Black, Latino, Indigenous, Asian-American and Pacific-Islander Caucus, also highlighted the lack of diversity in a Lawson-Ciccone ticket.
Pearson is 36, and openly gay — the first member of the Senate leadership team to identify as such when he was chosen to be majority leader in 2022.
“This is a chance to have an LGBTQ+ leader, a millennial leader, a different path,” Mack said.
Her comments come hours before David Hogg, vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, is set to headline a Rhode Island Democratic Party fundraiser at Fish Co. in Providence Thursday night. Hogg has been vocal about his efforts to unseat long-time party incumbents in Congress and “rebuild the bench” with new, younger representation.
Liz Beretta-Perik, state party chair, did not immediately return requests for comment Thursday about Hogg’s position on incumbents.
Ciccone said he was in good health and his age should not be a factor. He remained focused on “restoring” the chamber, noting the need for fiscal responsibility amid a projected deficit in fiscal 2026 and uncertainty over federal funding. 
“My door, similar to Dominick’s, is going to be open,” Ciccone said.

Federal government appeals ruling ordering detained Tufts student’s return to Vermont 

by Alan J. Keays 
April 23, 2025, 1:40 pmApril 23, 2025, 3:38 pm 



Attorneys for Öztürk filed a lawsuit alleging her detention was unlawful. In the suit, they argue she was wrongly targeted in violation of her free speech rights. Öztürk had co-authored an op-ed in Tufts’ student newspaper last year that called on the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel and to “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide.” Sessions, the Vermont federal judge, last week ordered the federal government to transfer Öztürk from Louisiana to Vermont. “Ms. Ozturk has presented viable and serious habeas claims which warrant urgent review on the merits,” he wrote, scheduling a bail hearing for May 9. Acting U.S. Attorney for the district of Vermont Michael Drescher, representing ICE and other federal agencies and officials in the case, appealed the decision earlier this week. He has signalled that the administration will seek “emergency relief” from the appeals court in an effort to halt Öztürk’s transfer.This story will be updated.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Judge rejects federal government’s attempt to halt detained Tufts student’s return to Vermont.",https://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/rumeysa-ozturk-8-20250414.jpg?fit=1024%2C676&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 16:09:13.400571

Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville, defends a compromise provision shifting teaching scholarships named after Black former lawmakers to five teacher-strapped counties on Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A bill to limit diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in schools, state government and health profession licensing advanced to the governor Thursday following a 64-26 vote in the House and a 34-16 tally in the Senate.
Senate Bill 289 — authored by Republican Sens. Tyler Johnson of Leo, and Gary Byrne of Byrneville — was tweaked in the final days of the session to specifically outlaw “discrimination” in state education, public employment and licensing settings that is “based on a personal characteristic of the person.”
Lawmakers also made last-minute changes to characteristics outlined in the bill, removing “disability and status as a veteran” from the list. The “personal characteristics” remaining in the bill are “race, religion, color, sex, national origin, or ancestry.”
“You can’t fix discrimination with discrimination,” Byrne said. “This bill is good for Indiana, and everybody should be judged by how hard you work — and that’s what this bill is about.”
The latest draft exempts “employment action(s) concerning participation in a public contract by a minority business enterprise, women’s business enterprise, or veteran business enterprise, if the employment action is authorized by law.”
A carveout also exists for colleges and universities. Schools can also make decisions around grants, scholarships or fee remissions on the basis of “personal characteristic(s)” as long as those awards do not include any “state funds or resources.”
But state offices and universities would not be allowed to require employees to complete training — or licensing — “asserting that, or endorsing the theory that,” a person with a certain personal characteristic:

is inherently superior or inferior to a person with a different personal characteristic;
should be blamed for actions committed in the past;
or has a moral character that is determined by a personal characteristic of the person.

Opposition remained
Democrats remained opposed to the bill on Thursday — particularly in the Senate, where debate lasted nearly two hours.
“In a utopia, every human should be treated equally and should not be discriminated against based on their race, their gender, their creed, their nationality, their political identity,” said Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis. “But this legislation is extremely harmful because it gives a blind eye to historical injustices by which generations of communities have been discriminated against.”
“It flips the script by saying we have no discrimination, we have no racism, and we should treat everybody equally. It ignores historical facts that continue to occur until this moment,” he continued. “This legislation ignores that people have different starting points in their lives, and in most of our history as a country, it was our government that pushed people behind the starting line.”
The legislation’s passage comes on the heels of Gov. Mike Braun’s executive order to replace DEI throughout state government policies and programming with “merit, excellence and innovation,” or MEI.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida Senate President Ben Albritton dropped the news Thursday afternoon that the 60-day legislative session will not as end as scheduled at the end of next week.
That’s due to an impasse between the House and Senate’s respectively passed budgets, specifically regarding their competing sales tax packages.
“At this time, I am disappointed to report we have not yet reached an agreement on allocations with the House,” Albritton told senators shortly after 2 p.m., when he acknowledged that the biggest hurdle remains the discrepancy between what type of package to present and how significant those tax cuts would be.
There is roughly a $4.4 billion gap between the proposed budgets of the two chambers.  The Senate’s proposed budget appropriates $117.36 billion, while the House’s proposal totals $112.95 billion.
House Speaker Daniel Perez announced last month a state sales tax rate cut from 6% to 5.25%, which would save taxpayers’ approximately $5 billion annually.
Albritton followed up with a more modest $2.1 billion tax plan, centered around a permanent elimination of the sales tax on clothing and shoes costing $75 or less. Other parts of the plan included a permanent reduction in the business rent tax from 2% to 1%, a one-time credit for vehicle registration fees, and several sales tax holidays.
His proposal included authorizing an analysis of the potential effects of eliminating property taxes, a proposal first floated by Gov. DeSantis, with the possibility of putting that idea before the voters via a constitutional amendment in 2026
Albritton said Thursday that his preference remains to focus “on a responsible level of targeted, broad-based sales tax relief this session, leaving room for voters to consider a more comprehensive reduction in property taxes at the next general election.”
He said that he and Senate Appropriations Chair Ed Hooper had spent “countless hours” with staff considering the House’s sales tax cut proposal and long-term budget assumptions “from every angle we can think of.”
“I understand their perspective and applaud their resolve to pursue better government, and I have immense respect for the Speaker and his entire team,” he said — adding, however that, “at the end of the day, I’m just uncomfortable with a proposal I believe will likely lead to shortfalls, if not substantial shortfalls, in the out-years.”
“Make no mistake about it, I am committed to passing historic, unprecedented tax relief. However, it won’t be at the expense of the long-term financial stability of our state.”
Albritton did say that the Senate is moving with alacrity when it comes to passing legislation — so much so that he was cancelling Friday’s scheduled floor session. He ended his briefing by saying that legislators “can head home for the weekend,” leading to a standing ovation from the senators in the chamber.
The  Legislature is constitutionally required to pass a balanced state budget before the  2025-2026 fiscal year starts on July 1. The 60-day legislative session was scheduled to end on Friday, May 2. There have been no additional details whether the Legislature will continue to immediately work past that date, or opt to return later in May or June.

Senate Bill 25-304 now heads to the Senate Appropriation Committee for consideration.
“What our criminal legal system needs — and what, more importantly, our survivors need — is for things to get done quickly,” said bill sponsor Sen. Mike Weissman, an Aurora Democrat. “The reason that we should care about quickly turning around sex assault evidence kits, to use that bloodless term, is because we owe one survivor justice, and maybe if we do that quickly enough, we can catch somebody and the next one or two or 10 survivors don’t have to become survivors in the first place.”

The bill is partially modeled on legislation from the Colorado Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee that was never introduced.
It would create a coordinator position at CBI to oversee the agency’s process and progress of completing the sexual assault kits, which include DNA samples and other evidence from survivors to aid in a criminal investigation. Colorado’s forensic services are facing a historic backlog of the kits due to reduced staff capacity and ballooning fallout from the discovery that former CBI forensic scientist Yvonne “Missy” Woods manipulated more than a thousand DNA test results over her career.
As of March, there were 1,424 kits in the backlog with an average turnaround time of 558 days, according to a recently implemented data dashboard. The backlog means delayed justice for survivors, as DNA evidence can often be critical for a criminal conviction.
“The impact of this growing delay in turnaround time for sexual assault evidence kits to be processed and analyzed is devastating for individual survivors, as so many of you have heard this spring, but it’s also destructive to public trust in our institutions and systems,” said Elizabeth Newman, the policy director for the Colorado Coalition Against Sexual Assault.
The coordinator considered under Weissman’s bill would report annually to the Legislature on data including the number of kits completed, the number of cases in the backlog, the capacity of state crime laboratories and the amount of additional DNA collected from crime scenes not captured in a kit. The coordinator would also assess and make recommendations on the efficiency of the testing process. That would ultimately bring a “cross-silo awareness” of what is happening at the state level lab and various local labs, Weissman said.
He said the coordinator position’s roles and responsibilities will likely change through the amendment process as he speaks with stakeholders.
The coordinator position would be paid for with a $150,000 grant using state general fund money.
The bill would also create a new notification requirement under the Victim Rights Act that would require a law enforcement agency to update a survivor on the status of their kit every 90 days.
It also sets a turnaround goal of 60 days. The agency’s current goal is 90 days, which it expects to achieve in 2027.
“To be real clear, I don’t think that we’re going to get there next month, but I do believe that we can build up our system to where we can get here, and I believe that we should make that promise to the impacted people in our state and to our future selves by putting it in statute,” Weissman said.
Lance Allen, CBI’s deputy director of forensic services, told lawmakers that he does not think the bill as written would reduce turnaround time for rape kits. He outlined recent actions from the agency, including using $3 million of repurposed funds to outsource processing for about 1,000 kits and hiring a third-party contractor to assess best practices.
“We have a plan to get rid of the backlog and fortunately have received funding to address a good portion of that, and then with the training that we are doing at the state level, we will be increasing our resources and be able to handle that capacity at the state level,” he said. “I wholeheartedly acknowledge that CBI is in the process of rebuilding trust. We know that.”
CBI currently has 16 scientists working at the state lab and is training 15 more.
So far, Weissman is the only sponsor on the bill. If it passes the Senate Appropriations Committee, it will move to the entire Senate for consideration, and then the House. The lawmaking term ends on May 7.

The letters from HHS referenced only “possible violations.”",,,,2025-04-24 16:09:13.400571

Free.,Federal judges pause U.S. Education Department enforcement of DEI ban,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judges-pause-us-education-department-enforcement-dei-ban,,"A federal judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration Thursday to pause enforcement of a new U.S. Education Department ban on diversity, equity and inclusion practices.The order came as another federal judge in New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction temporarily blocking the Trump administration from yanking federal funding from many schools.The New Hampshire order, though, only applied to schools that employ members of the National Education Association — the country’s largest labor union, which brought the case challenging the ban — or the Center for Black Educator Development.The rulings used different legal logic but arrived at the same conclusion: The administration’s ban on race-conscious practices is not valid.In Maryland, U.S. District Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher said she ruled not on the merits of the policy, but the way the Trump administration developed it.“This Court takes no view as to whether the policies at issue here are good or bad, prudent or foolish, fair or unfair. But this Court is constitutionally required to closely scrutinize whether the government went about creating and implementing them in the manner the law requires,” she wrote. “The government did not.”Gallagher’s order pauses the enforcement of a Feb. 14 letter to school districts from Craig Trainor, the department’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, that threatened to rescind federal funds for schools that use race-conscious practices in programming, admissions, scholarships and other aspects of student life.In New Hampshire, U.S. District Judge Landya McCafferty wrote that “the loss of federal funding would cripple the operations of many educational institutions.”McCafferty’s order has a nationwide effect, but McCafferty limited it to schools that employ NEA members, rejecting the union’s attempt to completely halt the policies outlined in the letter.Teachers unions suedThe Feb. 14 letter drew swift legal action, and the National Education Association brought the suit in New Hampshire against the administration alongside the Center for Black Educator Development. The American Federation of Teachers — one of the largest teachers unions in the country — filed a complaint in February alongside its affiliate, AFT-Maryland. The American Sociological Association and a public school district in Oregon also sued over the letter.“Today the court confirmed the importance of our job as educators to foster opportunity, dignity, and engagement,” Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said in a statement after the Maryland ruling.“The court agreed that this vague and clearly unconstitutional requirement is a grave attack on students, our profession, honest history, and knowledge itself,” she added. “It would hamper efforts to extend access to education, and dash the promise of equal opportunity for all, a central tenet of the United States since its founding.”NEA also celebrated the preliminary injunction granted in its case Thursday, and the union’s president, Becky Pringle, said in a statement “today’s ruling allows educators and schools to continue to be guided by what’s best for students, not by the threat of illegal restrictions and punishment.”The statement said President Donald Trump, billionaire head of the U.S. DOGE Service Elon Musk and Education Secretary Linda McMahon were responsible for an “attack” on public education.“The fact is that Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Linda McMahon are using politically motivated attacks and harmful and vague directives to stifle speech and erase critical lessons to attack public education, as they work to dismantle public schools,” Pringle said. “This is why educators, parents, and community leaders are organizing, mobilizing, and using every tool available to protect our students and their futures.”The Education Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.Letter raised questionsIn the February letter, Trainor offered a wide-ranging interpretation of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2023 involving Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, which struck down the use of affirmative action in college admissions.Trainor wrote that though the ruling “addressed admissions decisions, the Supreme Court’s holding applies more broadly.”The four-page letter raised a slew of questions for schools across pre-K through college over what fell within the requirements, and the department later released a Frequently Asked Questions document on the letter in an attempt to provide more guidance.Earlier this month, the Education Department gave state education leaders just days to certify all K-12 schools in their states were complying with the letter in order to keep receiving federal financial assistance. The department and the groups suing in the New Hampshire case later reached an agreement that paused enforcement.",,,,2025-04-24 16:09:13.400571

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Money was on the mind of the Iowa Board of Regents and the faculty and staff who spoke during its April meeting, with members discussing potential tuition changes, contracts for union members and salaries for non-union university employees.
Board President Sherry Bates, in remarks to the board, addressed the “difficult balance” of weighing the costs to students and the funds universities need to provide a quality education when determining tuition, assuring those present the board takes the responsibility very seriously.
Bates also announced a new committee that will conduct a study of potentially offering students a tuition guarantee, meaning their tuition costs won’t increase after their first year of undergraduate education. The committee, comprised of Regents David Barker and Christine Hensley, should have the study complete and ready to present to the board at its November meeting, Bates said.
“Setting tuition rates is one of the most important things the board does,” Bates said. “I have served on the board for a decade, and we have always been thoughtful and deliberative when considering tuition rates.”

Legislation awaiting Gov. Kim Reynolds’ signature would direct the board of regents and state universities to complete such a study, as well as set an April 30 deadline for the board to approve tuition rates for the upcoming academic year.
This year, the board will consider final approval of 2025-2026 tuition rates at its June meeting. The proposal for tuition, including 3% increases at the University of Iowa and Iowa State University and a 2.7% increase at the University of Northern Iowa for in-state undergraduate students, saw its first reading Thursday with no discussion or questions from the board.
Board ratifies union contracts
The board also ratified contracts for unions operating on state university campuses, including the Campaign to Organize Graduate Students (COGS), United Faculty and Service Employees International Union (SEIU). United Faculty and SEIU represent UNI faculty and tertiary health care employees at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, respectively.
Each of the unions will receive a 3% increase to base wages and minimum salaries in 2025 and 2026, according to contract summaries, with returning COGS and SEIU members set to earn additional 3% increases both years.
For university staff and faculty not organized under a union, representatives from the UI faculty senate and staff council, ISU faculty senate and professional and scientific council and UNI professional and scientific council spoke to the board Thursday about their work and the need for salary increases.
Caroline Sheerin, UI faculty senate president and law professor, said when adjusted for inflation, what she makes as a professor 20 years into the role is less than half of what she made in her first year of practicing law.
“You’ll just have to believe me when I say that the reason we do this work is not because we are looking to be heavily compensated,” Sheerin said. “The doctors, lawyers and engineers who draw a paycheck from this institution could be making far, far more money in the private sector.”
Faculty members work year-round, despite having nine-month contracts and the summer supposedly off, because they love teaching, researching, treating patients and more. Any increases to compensation the board can implement for faculty and staff would be “very welcome,” she said.
UNI Museum Director and Chief Curator Nathan Arndt spoke to the board on behalf of the 631 members of the professional and scientific council, of which almost half work in academic advancement as teachers or teaching support, he said.
All professional and scientific staff are essential to maintaining UNI as a “robust and healthy living learning community,” he said, and by better supporting them, the board would help both the students, institution and state as a whole.
“While it often goes unnoticed or unmentioned, many in this group feel they are often ignored, written off or overworked,” Arndt said. “Their drive to our student success is what keeps us passionate about our work, and I encourage you, the board of regents, to pay more attention.”
Jason Follett, ISU academic advisor and president of the professional and scientific council, concurred that the people he works with have been feeling “undervalued for some time.” While he applauded the work of the board and its staff, including the formation of a legislative committee, he said universities are still facing flat or lessening funding from the state, students are still dealing with rising tuition and outdated facilities and salaries are not keeping pace with costs.
Follett issued a challenge to members of the board on behalf of his team — work with lawmakers in both parties and advocate for ISU and employees of other state universities in order to show their importance to their institutions and the state.
“Just as we expect our elected officials to be responsive and engaged, the professional scientific council humbly requests that regents themselves be more active and visible beyond these meetings and through staff and press releases,” Follett said. “Get out and be proactive versus reactive and inactive.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Researchers at the University of Utah recently published a first-of-its-kind study that measures the impact dust has on melting snow in the Colorado River basin.
Dust has long been credited to accelerating snowmelt in the Intermountain West. Blowing from arid regions and settling in the mountains, the dust darkens the snow, lowering its albedo — essentially, darker snow doesn’t reflect the sunlight as well, leading to more heat absorption and speeding up the melting process. 
It’s particularly prevalent in the Colorado River basin, with large mountain ranges like the San Juans, La Sals and Maroon Bells pushed up against dry expanses of desert. As drought continues to impact the region, dust events have worsened, depleting the snowpack at faster rates and complicating an already precarious situation for the Colorado River and the 40 million people who get their drinking water from it. 
And while previous papers have recorded the impact dust has on snowmelt, University of Utah researchers are the first to study an area as large as the Colorado River headwaters, which spans multiple states. According to the university, there are no snowmelt models — streamflow forecasts in mountain basins essential for areas that rely on snowpack for water — that take dust into account.

“The degree of darkening caused by dust has been related to water forecasting errors. The water comes earlier than expected, and this can have real world impacts — for example if the ground is still frozen it’s too early for farmers to use. A reservoir manager can store early snowmelt, but they need the information to plan for that,” said McKenzie Skiles, associate professor at the university’s School of Environment, Society and Sustainability. “If we can start to build dust into the snowmelt forecast models, it will make water management decision-making more informed.”
Stiles is a co-lead author of the study, which was published in the scientific journal Geophysical Research Letters in March. 
Stiles and other researchers analyzed 23 years of satellite images, from 2021 to 2023, to observe snow darkened by dust in the spring months. They found that dust accelerated snowmelt in the Colorado River Basin every spring, even during less-dusty years.
During runoff season, typically between April and May, the snowpack melts about 10 to 15 millimeters each day. According to the study, dust deposition can accelerate snowmelt by 1 millimeter per hour during peak sunlight — during a “high-dust” year, that can factor out to about 10 extra millimeters each day. 
“It’s not just how much dust gets deposited over a season, but also the timing of dust deposition that matters,” said Patrick Naple, doctoral candidate of geography at the University of Utah and lead author of the study. “Dust is very effective at speeding up melt because it’s most frequently deposited in the spring when days are getting longer and the sun more intense. Even an extra millimeter per hour can make the snowpack disappear several weeks earlier than without dust deposition.”
One of the most comprehensive analyses of dust and snowmelt yet, the university says this research could improve water forecasting and allocation for communities that rely on the Colorado River.

Others remain in a holding pattern as they decide the future of some services.,"The walls inside the Middletown Library Service Center are lined with books — reading materials for summer and book club programs, books for the visually impaired and more, as well as some puppets of characters in children’s books. 
It’s a resource hub for other libraries and schools in Connecticut, and about half of its employees are paid with federal money. But with the recent loss of federal funding for the state library, those resources and services that schools and other libraries have come to depend on could be at risk.
The Middletown center is among the Connecticut libraries and museums facing funding cuts from the Institute of Museums and Library Services, part of a larger effort driven by the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to curtail government spending.
And just down the street is a stark reminder of the existential threat facing the librarians and programs.

Two tall wooden beams hold up a large sign that reads “Department of Government Efficiency.” It portrays President Donald J. Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, wearing sunglasses, against an American flag backdrop, in an apparent nod to the work of DOGE that has reshaped the federal government.
Through IMLS’ Grants to States program, the Connecticut State Library received $2.1 million a year. Every state gets money allocated through a population-based formula. As of last week, State Librarian Deborah Schander said Connecticut was one of three states, along with Washington and California, that had current fiscal year grants terminated midyear. That loss will amount to almost $1 million.

Seven grantees in Connecticut were set to receive a total of nearly $3 million in IMLS funding, with most of it to be doled out over a few years. Some of that money had been spent this year, but the vast majority of it is now gone for grantees like the state library and the Mark Twain House & Museum in Hartford.
The cuts are leaving many of these educational and cultural hubs in limbo. Some of these Connecticut institutions need to lay off workers or consultants, while others remain in a holding pattern as they decide the future of some services and see if they can fill in the gaps.
The Institute of Museum and Library Services is among the federal agencies caught in the Trump administration’s push to remake the federal government, though IMLS is smaller than most and its grants made up a tiny fraction of all federal spending. Trump signed an executive order in late March dramatically paring back that department and six others that he deemed “unnecessary.”
That prompted IMLS to place staff on administrative leave. Within days, libraries and museums that received funding were informed of the immediate termination of their grants.
The order to dismantle IMLS and other agencies is tied up in a lawsuit backed by a coalition of state attorneys general, including Connecticut’s William Tong.
Every recipient received a letter in early April about the termination of federal funding, saying the grant is “unfortunately no longer consistent with the agency’s priorities and no longer serves the interests of the United States.” The letter goes on to say it’s repurposing funds in a new way to support the president’s agenda.
This caught many recipients off guard, leaving some angry and confused. They are currently dealing with tough decisions about how to make up that funding.
“This is libraries. This is cultural heritage. This is who we are. It’s just appalling,” said Sam Quigley, director of the Lyman Allyn Art Museum in New London. “When do museums and libraries not serve the interest of the United States?”

A group of affected library and museum grantees recently met by Zoom to discuss the funding cuts, though many of them had already been in contact with one another since receiving their grant termination letters. Grantees have had different experiences with making last-minute requests to draw down funding after the termination letters. Some were denied, while others were able to get their final reimbursements.
They recently received another letter, requiring grantees to submit a report by May 12 detailing what progress they achieved under the grant as well as itemized charges.
The termination of federal funding has put a financial strain on some of the arts and humanities nonprofits. Many of them will not be able to make up the loss in funding. That has put added pressure on them to consider fundraising from elsewhere to fill in the gaps and tap into the private sector.
The Connecticut State Library was the biggest recipient in the state of IMLS funding, which it has received since the agency was created in 1996. The state library also got two other awards in one-time funding this year through the same agency. 
The larger grant — $2 million to support 13 staff members in the Division of Library Development — provides resources to boost local libraries and build capacity. It also supports the CT Library for Accessible Books, which helps provide audio and braille books. That program benefits about 5,500 patrons in Connecticut, including around 300 veterans.

Schander said the federal funding is tailored to certain state needs and gives them a framework to make local decisions.
“It is possible that we will have to make some hard decisions about the library services we provide,” Schander said. “We are in active conversations and considering what to do moving forward. We’re currently operating as usual. We know we will need to make decisions in the near future about what to do.”
The Middletown Library Service Center, which is part of the CT State Library, is likely to feel the ramifications of the funding loss, though most of its programs are mandated by state statute.
It is waiting to see what funding cuts mean for the state budget and how state lawmakers might adjust the budget to account for federal losses. In the meantime, Dawn La Valle, director of the Division of Library Development for the state library system, said they’re carrying on with the work.
“We’re still operating as is. It’s a difficult situation,” La Valle said. 
La Valle said by offering training for librarians, larger bundles of books, access to technology and reading guides for kids, the library center saves local Connecticut libraries millions of dollars each year. For example, the center provides the software that allows kids to count books and pages read for their summer reading program.

Kymberlee Powe, the children and young adult consultant at the division, just finished putting together a summer reading list for libraries. And Monday, other staff were busy preparing dozens of copies of the state’s Nutmeg Book Awards for distribution.
Libraries or classrooms that want a large group of kids to read a book often get multiple copies from the Middletown center. They also provide books for schools participating in the Battle of the Books reading competition, and offer “bundles,” for classrooms exploring topics such as Connecticut history or social-emotional learning, Powe said. 
The center trains librarians in new technologies and ways of managing programs. They also operate the Connecticut Library for Accessible Books. The Middletown center has technology and books available for people to check out if they are visually impaired or otherwise disabled and need an accessible device for “talking books,” or books read aloud.
They also have devices that offer electronic books in braille. On Monday, one of the reader consultants spoke with a patron who was running low on books. He asked for more of his favorites, which she was able to look up.
“The usual?” she asked. “OK, we’ll get a cartridge out to you tomorrow.”

That program is federally funded through the Library of Congress. While it’s not immediately at risk, Matt Geeza, the Middletown program’s director, said he still doesn’t know what the future looks like in federal funding.
Museums too
Connecticut museums that get federal money are also feeling the squeeze. 
The Mark Twain House & Museum in Hartford received federal funding through IMLS’ Museums Empowered program. The museum was in the middle of the first year of their grant, which was $228,000 over three years. The award was terminated mid-year, and they spent about a third of it. The loss will amount to about $180,000.
The money helped them train staff in engagement and audience evaluation and hire consultants to do focus groups and surveys to inform how they prepare for new programs and exhibits. They will not have any staffing cuts but will lose all of their consultants — some of whom were based in Connecticut or the northeast.
Jessica Neuwirth, deputy director for strategic initiatives and development at the Mark Twain House & Museum, noted there is “no other funding out there for this kind of work.”
“It’s crucial that we learn about and engage with the community around us,” Neuwirth said. “We need to figure out how to go forward. The path is not clear at the moment.”
“I think we all know that a vibrant arts and culture scene improves every community that it’s a part of,” she added. “To lose that is to lose the glue that keeps us together.”

It was the museum’s first Museums Empowered grant. The Mark Twain House & Museum was hopeful it would get funding through the National Endowment for the Humanities, but that now seems unlikely after major NEH cuts from the Trump administration.
Other museums in Connecticut have used IMLS funding for years.
Now the director of the Lyman Allyn Art Museum in New London, Quigley said the museum has received those federal dollars for the past nine years. The most recent grant of $151,000 started last September and was intended to last for three years.
This one helped the museum hire a full-time staffer who would specifically work on the museum’s fiber and textile collection this year. But without that money, they cannot keep up that role. Quigley said they are trying to give that employee some buffer time and will keep her on until May 17.
The museum hoped to image and rehouse 3,000 objects. Over the past eight months of having the grant, they got through close to 500. Quigley said the employee covered by federal funding helped move from paper-based to digital records and improved access so people interested in art all over the world can have virtual access to their collection.
“We don’t know if there will be somebody who can come to our rescue,” Quigley said. “Given the economic turmoil of this time, people are getting nervous about making gifts of this magnitude.”
For Quigley, the federal funding has been about better accessibility to the public, in Connecticut and beyond.
“It’s depriving the public of information about collections that they rightly should have. It’s all about accessibility. We can’t possibly show a large percentage of our collection at any given time. To provide digital access is the next best thing,” Quigley said.
The loss of that funding leaves a big question mark about the future of some priorities.
“They kind of help keep the lights on. They do all the back-end work,” he said about IMLS funding. “Nobody else pays for that.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_0421_SR_Libraries_273-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 15:15:52.595620
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-04-24 19:10:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Judge blocks Trump push to cut funding to schools over DEI,Erica E. Phillips and Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/04/24/dei-education-funding-trump/,CT education leaders hailed a federal judge's ruling that blocked directives that threatened to cut funding for schools with DEI programs.,"A federal judge on Thursday blocked Trump administration directives that threatened to cut federal funding for public schools with diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by the National Education Association and the American Civil Liberties Union, which accused the Republican administration of violating teachers’ due process and First Amendment rights.
“This is exactly what we want to see,” Kate Dias, president of Connecticut Education Association, the state’s largest teachers union. “A lot of the actions by the Department of Education under the Trump administration have been intentionally vague, trying to confuse, and get compliance based off the lack of clarity.” 
“Those efforts need to be questioned,” Dias said.
In February, the U.S. Education Department told schools and colleges they needed to end any practice that differentiates people based on their race. Earlier this month, the department ordered states to gather signatures from local school systems certifying compliance with civil rights laws, including the rejection of what the federal government calls “illegal DEI practices.”
Last week, Gov. Ned Lamont and Connecticut Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker said the state responded to the request and would not be submitting signatures.
The Trump administration’s directives do not carry the force of law but threaten to use civil rights enforcement to rid schools of DEI practices. Schools were warned that continuing such practices “in violation of federal law” could lead to U.S. Justice Department litigation and a termination of federal grants and contracts.
The lawsuit argued that the orders were “unconstitutionally vague,” an issue underscored in the ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Landya McCafferty.
She said the April letter does not make clear what the department believes a DEI program entails or when it believes such programs cross the line into violating civil rights law. “The Letter does not even define what a ‘DEI program’ is,” McCafferty wrote.
The judge also said there is reason to believe the department’s actions amount to a violation of teachers’ free speech rights.
“A professor runs afoul of the 2025 Letter if she expresses the view in her teaching that structural racism exists in America, but does not do so if she denies structural racism’s existence. That is textbook viewpoint discrimination,” McCafferty wrote.
The lawsuit filed in March argues the Feb. 14 memo, formally known as a “Dear Colleague” letter, would limit academic freedom by dictating what students can be taught.
The memo said schools have promoted DEI efforts at the expense of white and Asian American students. It dramatically expands the interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision barring the use of race in college admissions to all aspects of education, including, hiring, promotion, scholarships, housing, graduation ceremonies and campus life.
Steven Hernández, executive director of education advocacy group ConnCAN, said the federal guidance “fundamentally misunderstands the very purpose of good diversity, equity and inclusion policy and initiatives.”
DEI is about “understanding the value that every human being brings into a space,” he said. “When you mandate DEI initiatives that are shallow on their face — or exclude them writ large — what you’re doing is exacerbating the disconnect and closing the door on meaningful conversations and relationships.”
The memo faces another challenge from the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, which has asked a federal court in Maryland to stop the department from enforcing it.
Both lawsuits argue that the guidance is so vague that it leaves schools and educators in limbo about what they may do, such as whether voluntary student groups for minority students are still allowed.
CEA’s Dias said she’s hoping a similar ruling in the Maryland case comes soon, “that says, ‘Listen, you cannot make vague threats. That does not work.'”
President Donald Trump’s education secretary, Linda McMahon, had warned of potential funding cuts if states did not return the form by Friday.
In a Tuesday interview on the Fox Business Network, McMahon said states that refuse to sign could “risk some defunding in their districts.” The purpose of the form is “to make sure there’s no discrimination that’s happening in any of the schools,” she said.
The April directive asked states to collect the certification form from local school districts and also sign it on behalf of the state, giving assurance that schools are in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Schools and states are already required to give assurances to that effect in separate paperwork, but the new form adds language on DEI, warning that using diversity programs to discriminate can bring funding cuts, fines and other penalties.
The form threatens schools’ access to Title I, the largest source of federal revenue for K-12 education and a lifeline for schools in low-income areas.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25113784490343-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 17:07:56.867506

Mar-Jac Poultry was named one of the “Dirty Dozen” in a Thursday report by the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health. It made the list last year, too. Other companies on the list are in areas including agriculture, retail, health care, fast food, strip clubs, food manufacturing and private prisons. 
“These companies have failed to eliminate known, preventable hazards – risking lives through negligence, and in at least one case, actively opposing stronger worker protections,” the report states. 
Themes of the “Dirty Dozen” report are sudden workplace trauma, heat exposure and immigrant labor. The report’s release coincides with Workers Memorial Week, which is from April 23 to May 1.
Three workers have died in Mar-Jac facilities since 2020, including 16-year-old Duvan Pérez at its Hattiesburg processing plant in 2023. 
While cleaning a deboning machine, he was caught in a rotating shaft and pulled in, according to an investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Federal labor laws don’t allow those under the age of 18 to work in meat processing because of dangerous machinery. 
A February 2023 wrongful death lawsuit filed by Pérez’s family alleges that a temporary staffing agency assigned him to complete work that he was legally unable to do due to his age. The suit also alleges Mar-Jac had a history of worker safety issues. 
In a statement after the teenager’s death, Mar-Jac said staffing companies are responsible for verifying employee’s age and identification, and an attorney for the company told NBC News last year that Pérez used identification of a 32-year-old man to get the job. 
A jury trial for the lawsuit is scheduled for March 11, 2026, in Forrest County. 
Last year, OSHA cited Mar-Jac for over $212,000 in penalties for multiple safety failures, including failure to protect from hazards like falls, machine entanglement and electrocution. Last summer, Mar-Jac settled with OSHA and agreed to pay nearly $165,000 in fines and implement safety measures. 
At one of Mar-Jac’s Alabama plants, investigators from the U.S. Department of Labor found children working on the kill floor deboning poultry and cutting carcasses – some who had been working there for months. 
Again, the company said the minors were hired with documents showing they were over 18 years old.
“Mar-Jac will continue to vigorously defend itself and expects to prevail in this matter,” the company said in a statement to ABC News. “Mar-Jac is committed to complying with all relevant law.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06073833/IMG_7037-scaled.jpg,,,2025-04-24 15:15:52.595620

Ned Lamont said the new solar panels at prisons in Enfield, Cheshire and Somers are 'greener, cleaner and more affordable.'","Standing in front of an array of 4,500 Canadian solar panels and across from a wall topped with barbed wire, Gov. Ned Lamont today announced the completion of seven solar projects at prisons located in Enfield, Cheshire and Somers. 
The solar panels now bring power to parts of Cheshire Correctional Institution, Manson Youth Institute, Willard Correctional Institution, Carl Robinson Correctional Institution and Enfield Correctional Institution. 
“It’s greener, cleaner and more affordable,” Lamont said at a press conference at Cheshire Correctional Institution on Thursday — blanketed in springtime sun.
All together, the solar panels are estimated to save $11 million in energy costs to the Department of Correction over 25 years, according to the governor’s office and the Connecticut Green Bank.
The more than 15,000 panels across the seven facilities are also expected to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide the facilities produce by about 5,000 metric tons per year — the equivalent of 5.4 million pounds of coal, officials said. 
Nikki Dow, a solar project manager with the CT Green Bank, told The Connecticut Mirror that the project broke ground in 2023 and was completed at the end of 2024. She said the panels had been operating for the last few months. 
The project was a partnership between the CT Green Bank and the company TotalEnergies.  The state of Connecticut didn’t cover any of the cost.
Alex Sarly, Associate Director of Development for TotalEnergies, said the company had invested $20 million in the project, and will charge the state 7.5 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity. The rate will remain fixed for 25 years. 
Lamont praised the public-private partnership. Referencing a CT Mirror article from earlier this week, which reported New England’s demand for power hit an all-time low on Easter weekend, Lamont partially attributed that energy efficiency to the solar panels. 
“This is the way that we can reduce load upon our grid, hold down peak usage, hold down peak pricing, and make a difference for each and every one of you in your lives,” he said. 
Chris Iwanik, director of engineering for the Department of Correction, said the portion of energy use the solar panels replace varies among facilities and depending on the time of year. But he added that at Cheshire Correctional Institution, the solar panels could supply as much as 85% to 90% of the facility’s needs at its peak times. 
The state Department of Administrative Services has a power purchase agreement with the quasi-public Connecticut Green Bank, allowing state agencies to place solar cells on their properties. Michelle Gilman, Commissioner of the Department of Administrative Services, said the state is also working on solar projects at some of the state’s technical high schools, three state properties in Hartford and the Department of Labor headquarters in Wethersfield. 
Lamont said the state is also looking at partnering with TotalEnergies to provide solar panels to residences at a lower cost.

(Photo via Google Earth) A new national study has found that private equity firms continue to purchase and then bankrupt nursing homes around the nation.
According to a report issued this week by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit organization that focuses on the impact of the private equity industry on people and the planet, the percentage of American nursing homes now owned by private equity forms ranges from 5 to 13%, with the upper range of that estimate more likely due to the complex manner in which a facility’s true ownership is sometimes camouflaged.
That finding is consistent with a 2023 report from the Government Accountability Office, which reported that while federal data shows at least 5% of nursing homes nationwide are owned by private equity firms, the data is flawed and the true number is likely higher.

In recent years, the acquisition of nursing homes by private equity investors has come under scrutiny by regulators, the media and members of Congress, with critics suggesting too many profit-minded investors are targeting care facilities for acquisition, starving them of cash while collecting a reliable stream of income from Medicare, and then cashing out, in some cases by filing for bankruptcy protection.
In its report, PESP examines six private equity-backed nursing home deals that occurred within the past three years. PESP found that at least three nursing home companies owned directly or indirectly by private equity firms have filed for bankruptcy in recent years: LaVie Care Centers/Consulate Health Care in 2024, Goldner Capital Management in 2024, and Gulf Coast Health Care in 2022.
One private equity firm buys 29 Iowa homes
One acquisition detailed in the report involves the private equity firm Cascade Capital Group, which in September 2024 acquired one of Iowa’s largest nursing home chains, ABCM Corp., for $85 million. The deal included 326 assisted living units as well as 29 nursing homes with 2,346 skilled-nursing beds.
The sale led to 7% of Iowa’s 410 nursing homes being handed over to a private equity firm. A Cascade Capital affiliate, Legacy Healthcare, now manages the homes.
Last year, the non-profit Center for Medicare Advocacy compared federal data from the Iowa homes with data on other Legacy-managed nursing homes and found that the Cascade/Legacy facilities had, on average, considerably lower ratings for overall performance and for their inspection outcomes. They also had lower nurse-staffing ratings, more abuse citations, higher federal civil money penalties, and more denials of payment for new admissions, the center found.
The federal data indicates the Cascade Capital facilities performed more poorly than homes under ABCM’s management, with the Cascade Capital facilities being fined 17 times as much as their ABCM counterparts.
Each ABCM facility had, on average, incurred $4,815 in federal fines over the past three years, while the Legacy-managed facilities averaged $83,994 in federal fines.
In October 2024, a month after Cascade acquired the Iowa nursing homes, a 45-year-old resident of the chain’s Harmony House Health Care Center in Waterloo died. Inspectors reported that the resident, who had special dietary restrictions that limited her food intake to soft, bite-sized items, choked after “stuffing an entire peanut butter and jelly sandwich in her mouth.”
The state alleged that “staff at Harmony House failed to develop and put in place an effective behavioral intervention plan that might have discouraged such behavior” and on Nov. 6, 2024, it imposed a $10,000 fine on the facility. State records show that fine has yet to be paid, with the full amount still owed.
Ownership not always revealed to regulators
The new report also highlights Gulf Coast Health Care’s acquisition of a nursing home chain that operated 28 skilled nursing facilities in Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. In 2021, Gulf Coast was facing 167 personal injury or wrongful death claims and filed for bankruptcy.
“Multiple studies confirm the harmful effects that private equity ownership has on nursing homes, and the increased risk placed on residents and workers,” the report states. It cautions that the Trump administration may do little to address the issue, noting that during the president’s first term, federal protocols were revised “to discourage regulators from levying fines against nursing homes,” even in cases of resident deaths.
According to the New York Times, that effort was part of a broader plan to relax regulations and reduce bureaucracy and government oversight of business. For example, a requirement that every care facility employ at least one specialist in preventing infections was replaced with a requirement that an anti-infection specialist spend “sufficient time” at the facility.
The report recommends that federal and state agencies be given the authority to approve or reject mergers and sales involving nursing homes based on factors that include the potential impact on quality of care.
The report also calls for greater transparency in nursing home ownership. While homes are now required to report information about their owners, including private equity firms and real estate investment trusts, government authorities should be coordinating efforts to ensure that all facilities comply fully with such requirements.
Some ownership data kept secret by State of Iowa
The report also recommends that nursing homes be required to file public, consolidated cost reports that would detail the owners’ payments to themselves through affiliates and related parties, an amount now thought to be in the billions of dollars.
Under a state law that was approved in 2023, nursing home buyers in Iowa must submit to the state documentation of relationships to any related corporations and provide details of their projected revenue and expenses.
When asked whether the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing imposed such requirements on the buyers of the ABCM facilities, a department spokesperson said only that it followed the requirements of Iowa law, “which includes a robust financial analysis.”
The spokesperson noted that under state law, all of the information a buyer provides to the state that is related to their business relationships and compliance with the new financial regulations are treated as confidential and are not subject to public disclosure through the state’s Open Records Law.
Earlier this year, Sen. Claire Celsi, a West Des Moines Democrat, introduced Senate File 533, which would have barred the state from approving any change of ownership that results in a nursing home being acquired by a private equity fund or real estate investment trust.
That bill, as well as Senate File 536, which would have required the Office of Long-Term Care Ombudsman to prioritize on-site visits to homes taken over by private equity firms, failed to advance.
The nursing home industry’s main lobbying organization, the American Health Care Association, has argued that with private equity firms owning as few as 5% of all homes, the issue is “distraction” from the real threats faced by facilities and their residents, such as workforce shortages.
In a written statement to McKnight’s Long-Term Care News, the AHCA said “the reality is that owners of long-term care facilities are extremely diverse and are often run by Main Street, not Wall Street.”

,California,2025-04-24 18:53:39+00:00,CalMatters,Biden let California get creative with Medicaid spending. Trump is signaling that may end,Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/04/medicaid-waiver-calaim/,"California uses Medicaid to pay for a range of nontraditional health care services, including housing. The Trump administration wants to scale back those programs.","In summary
California uses Medicaid to pay for a range of nontraditional health care services, including housing. The Trump administration wants to scale back those programs.


In 2022, California made sweeping changes to its Medi-Cal program that reimagined what health care could look like for some of the state’s poorest and sickest residents by covering services from housing to healthy food. But the future of that program, known as CalAIM, could be at risk under the Trump administration. 
In recent weeks, federal officials have signaled that support for creative uses of Medi-Cal funding is waning, particularly uses that California has invested in such as rent assistance and medically tailored meals. Medi-Cal is California’s name for Medicaid.
The moves align with a narrower vision of Medicaid espoused by newly confirmed Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services head Dr. Mehmet Oz, who said during his swearing-in ceremony that Medicaid spending was crowding out spending on education and other services in states with the federal government “paying most of the bill.”
“This one really bothers me. There are states who are using Medicaid — Medicaid dollars for people who are vulnerable — for services that are not medical,” Oz said.
It also fits with broader GOP calls to slim down the federal government. Medicaid is under scrutiny as part of a GOP-led budget process in the House of Representatives that calls for $880 billion in cuts over 10 years to programs including Medicaid.
“The messaging that we want to go back to the basics of Medicaid puts all of these waiver programs in jeopardy,” said John Baackes, former chief executive of L.A. Care, the state’s largest Medi-Cal health insurer.
CalAIM is authorized under a federal waiver that allows states to experiment with their Medicaid programs to try to save money and improve health outcomes. Under the waiver, California added extra benefits for high-cost users to help with food insecurity, housing instability,  substance use and behavioral health challenges.
Roughly half of all Medi-Cal spending can be attributed to 5% of high-cost users, according to state documents.
But in March, the federal government rescinded guidelines supporting Medi-Cal spending for social services. It also sent states a letter in April indicating that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would no longer approve a funding mechanism that helps support CalAIM, although that money will continue until 2026.
Together, these moves should worry states that operate programs like CalAIM, said Kathy Hempstead, senior policy officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
“Under the Biden administration states were encouraged to experiment with things like that: To prescribe people prescriptions to get healthy food, to refer people to community-based services,” Hempstead said. “This administration is not receptive at all to … that vision of the Medicaid program.”
In a press release, CMS said it is putting an end to spending that isn’t “directly tied to health care services.”
“Mounting expenditures, such as covering housekeeping for individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid or high-speed internet for rural healthcare providers, distracts from the core mission of Medicaid, and in some instances, serves as an overly-creative financing mechanism to skirt state budget responsibilities,” the press release states.
These signals from the federal government apply to future applications for Medicaid changes, and do not change California’s current programs or funding. The state’s CalAIM waiver expires at the end of 2026, and another similar waiver that supports California’s efforts to improve behavioral health care expires in 2029.
According to a statement from the Department of Health Care Services, the agency that oversees Medi-Cal, all programs “remain federally approved and operational.”
“We appreciate our Medi-Cal providers and community partners, and together we will push full steam ahead to transform our health system and improve health outcomes,” the department said.

Paul Shafer, co-director of the Boston University Medicaid Policy Lab, said decades of public health research show that people have worse health outcomes that require more expensive treatment when their social needs aren’t met.
“We’ve spent the last few decades in public health and health policy, arguing that so much of health and medical costs is driven by environmental factors — people’s living conditions, income, etc.” Shafer said.
But, Shafer said, programs like CalAIM are relatively recent and the research hasn’t had enough time to show whether paying for non-traditional services saves money.
For example, California’s street medicine doctors who take care of people who are homeless say that their patients often cycle in and out of the emergency room — the most expensive point of service in the health care system. They have no place to recover from medical procedures, no address to deliver medications, and the constant exposure to the elements takes years off of their lives, doctors say. 
CalAIM gives them options to help their clients find housing. 
The federal government’s decision not to fund programs like this in the future is a “step backward,” Shafer said. 
“I think we can all read the tea leaves and say that that means they’re sort of unlikely to be renewed,” he said.

The Trump administration wants to scale back those programs.","In summary
California uses Medicaid to pay for a range of nontraditional health care services, including housing. The Trump administration wants to scale back those programs.


In 2022, California made sweeping changes to its Medi-Cal program that reimagined what health care could look like for some of the state’s poorest and sickest residents by covering services from housing to healthy food. But the future of that program, known as CalAIM, could be at risk under the Trump administration. 
In recent weeks, federal officials have signaled that support for creative uses of Medi-Cal funding is waning, particularly uses that California has invested in such as rent assistance and medically tailored meals. Medi-Cal is California’s name for Medicaid.
The moves align with a narrower vision of Medicaid espoused by newly confirmed Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services head Dr. Mehmet Oz, who said during his swearing-in ceremony that Medicaid spending was crowding out spending on education and other services in states with the federal government “paying most of the bill.”
“This one really bothers me. There are states who are using Medicaid — Medicaid dollars for people who are vulnerable — for services that are not medical,” Oz said.
It also fits with broader GOP calls to slim down the federal government. Medicaid is under scrutiny as part of a GOP-led budget process in the House of Representatives that calls for $880 billion in cuts over 10 years to programs including Medicaid.
“The messaging that we want to go back to the basics of Medicaid puts all of these waiver programs in jeopardy,” said John Baackes, former chief executive of L.A. Care, the state’s largest Medi-Cal health insurer.
CalAIM is authorized under a federal waiver that allows states to experiment with their Medicaid programs to try to save money and improve health outcomes. Under the waiver, California added extra benefits for high-cost users to help with food insecurity, housing instability,  substance use and behavioral health challenges.
Roughly half of all Medi-Cal spending can be attributed to 5% of high-cost users, according to state documents.
But in March, the federal government rescinded guidelines supporting Medi-Cal spending for social services. It also sent states a letter in April indicating that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would no longer approve a funding mechanism that helps support CalAIM, although that money will continue until 2026.
Together, these moves should worry states that operate programs like CalAIM, said Kathy Hempstead, senior policy officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
“Under the Biden administration states were encouraged to experiment with things like that: To prescribe people prescriptions to get healthy food, to refer people to community-based services,” Hempstead said. “This administration is not receptive at all to … that vision of the Medicaid program.”
In a press release, CMS said it is putting an end to spending that isn’t “directly tied to health care services.”
“Mounting expenditures, such as covering housekeeping for individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid or high-speed internet for rural healthcare providers, distracts from the core mission of Medicaid, and in some instances, serves as an overly-creative financing mechanism to skirt state budget responsibilities,” the press release states.
These signals from the federal government apply to future applications for Medicaid changes, and do not change California’s current programs or funding. The state’s CalAIM waiver expires at the end of 2026, and another similar waiver that supports California’s efforts to improve behavioral health care expires in 2029.
According to a statement from the Department of Health Care Services, the agency that oversees Medi-Cal, all programs “remain federally approved and operational.”
“We appreciate our Medi-Cal providers and community partners, and together we will push full steam ahead to transform our health system and improve health outcomes,” the department said.

Paul Shafer, co-director of the Boston University Medicaid Policy Lab, said decades of public health research show that people have worse health outcomes that require more expensive treatment when their social needs aren’t met.
“We’ve spent the last few decades in public health and health policy, arguing that so much of health and medical costs is driven by environmental factors — people’s living conditions, income, etc.” Shafer said.
But, Shafer said, programs like CalAIM are relatively recent and the research hasn’t had enough time to show whether paying for non-traditional services saves money.

Amid deteriorating conditions in the current Statehouse, Alabama is pursuing what would be the nation's first new State Capitol in nearly 50 years. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Senate passed a bill Thursday authorizing the demolition of the Alabama Statehouse.
SB 279, sponsored by Sen. Sam Givhan, R-Huntsville, gives the Alabama Legislature permission to tear down the current building after relocating to the new Statehouse, anticipated in 2026. The bill passed unanimously and heads to the House for consideration.
“This is the one that deals with the destruction of this fine building right here,” Givhan said to the Senate body.
Givhan said the legislation provides processes for liquidating property that won’t be used in the new Statehouse. The bill states that parts or materials of the current building “may be reused, recycled, upcycled, sold, or disposed of, as determined by the Legislative Council in a manner that is fiscally responsible.” 
The bill would also allow the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate to sell furniture that won’t be used in the new building to “members and employees of the Legislature.”
“It just deals with that,” Givhan said.
The bill passed without discussion.
Lawmakers have used the current Statehouse, the old Highway Department building originally intended as a temporary space during Capitol renovations, since 1986. Problems like mold led to the 2023 decision to build a new facility, which will be the nation’s first new statehouse since 1977.

(Photo by Bim/Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished without a Getty subcription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — House lawmakers advanced a bill on Thursday creating English-language proficiency and citizenship requirements for commercial drivers utilizing Oklahoma roads. 
Critics said the bill was “drastically” changed from its original topic of the legality of ATVs on some U.S. highways and could harm businesses.
Senate Bill 20, authored by Rep. Jonathan Wilk, R-Goldsby, moved through the House committee along a party line vote. The new language would require anyone operating a commercial motor vehicle in the state to have a “sufficient proficiency” in the English language and a valid commercial license from the United States, or from Canada and Mexico with a valid work visa. Drivers must also carry proof of citizenship for the country that issued the license. 
It also prohibits people who hold certain tourism and business visas from operating commercial motor vehicles in the state. Penalties for violations of the bill range from $2,000 to $5,000 fines and vehicles being impounded. 
A commercial driver’s license allows a motorist to operate specialized vehicles like buses or semi-trucks. A commercial motor vehicle refers to any motor vehicle used in interstate commerce to transport property or passengers, with specific weight and passenger limits. 
Rep. Arturo Alonso-Sandoval, D-Oklahoma City, said the new language was a “drastic change from the original bill and the original intent” of the measure.
This bill could be a burden on businesses and force them to drive around Oklahoma rather than travel through the state, Alonso-Sandoval said. 
Wilk, the bill author, said it’s a “due burden” to ensure businesses operate “right” with “qualified and safe drivers.”
He said this is a “public safety” bill that is intended to protect residents and anyone using Oklahoma’s roads. Traffic fatalities had increased since federal rules were amended to allow states to waive some commercial driver testing requirements, he said. A National Safety Council analysis shows the number of large trucks involved in fatal crashes has increased slightly since 2016.  
A 2016 memo from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration removed the requirement to “place drivers out of service” who have “English Language Proficiency violations,” and changed the agency’s standard for determining non-compliance.
An Arkansas-based trucking association has been backing a measure in Arkansas similar to Wilk’s and attributed a rise in fatal crashes involving large trucks partly to the 2016 federal policy change. They said more nondomiciled commercial licenses are being issued to drivers with lower qualifications. 
While Wilk said he hasn’t spoken to any Oklahoma-based trucking associations, he said truckers in his district requested the measure. 
The bill doesn’t prohibit licensed drivers from other states from coming through Oklahoma, he said. 
Rep. Annie Menz, D-Norman, said the language changes still “merit” more consideration and asked Wilk to stall it. 
“You should still feel empowered to want to work on it more if you want to, because like I said, your name is on it,” she said. “It’s something that your name is on. The people of your district, their name is on it through that. So would you be willing to, no pun intended, park it here in this lovely committee … to be able to work on the language?”

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)The Senate voted Thursday to codify Gov. Ron DeSantis’ faith and community initiative amid scrutiny of the initiative’s former leader’s involvement in campaigning against the unsuccessful abortion-rights amendment.
Senators’ 27-9 vote to ensure that an office of faith and community would remain in the executive branch after DeSantis’ term ends came a week after it became known that the initiative’s liaison had stepped down to lead an anti-abortion policy council.
Although all Republicans voted for the bill, SB 820, two also supported an amendment from Boca Raton Democratic Sen. Tina Polsky prohibiting the liaison from participating in political campaigns while on duty and using the office to influence people’s votes.
Polsky read emails from Erik Dellenback, the former liaison, sent to faith leaders across the state advocating against the amendment to protect abortion access under the governor’s masthead. Polsky brought up Dellenback’s remarks framing the abortion-rights amendment as a biblical issue during an event held by Florida Family Voice, the group he’s now CEO of.
“We’ve seen the abuse in this last election cycle of using the governor’s office, using state agencies, and using this office of faith and community to promote a particular viewpoint, and you can’t say it’s not political,” Polsky said. Her amendment failed.
Former Senate President Don Gaetz and Miami Republican Sen. Alexis Calatayud voted for Polsky’s amendment.
Dellenback left both his role with the faith and community initiative and as executive director of Hope Florida. News of the resignation emerged as the House deepened its probe into the Hope Florida Foundation, the charity associated with First Lady Casey DeSantis’ initiative.
Jacksonville Republican Sen. Clay Yarborough, who’s sponsoring the proposal, said that the Florida Supreme Court dismissed a complaint over state officials’ involvement against the abortion-rights amendment. The court said the attorney who filed the suit lacked standing to do so as a civilian.
“My opinion on the issue is not relevant to the bill that’s before us,” Yarborough said regarding how he felt about the emails Dellenback had sent.
However, Senate Democratic Leader Jason Pizzo said that DeSantis’ influence makes it impossible for Floridians to file complaints against government officials, pointing out that the governor appointed his former chief of staff, James Uthmeier, as the new attorney general.
“There’s not even a lieutenant governor to try to reason with,” Pizzo said. “Right now, in the four corners of Florida, where is the ability to redress or have recourse of your grievance?”
The House bill, HB 293, has cleared all of its committee stops but has not been scheduled for a House vote.

Gov. Gavin Newsom reset his relationship with President Donald Trump after the Los Angeles fires, but he has yet to secure the disaster aid he wants. Now new political pressures are pushing California’s governor back into confrontation with Trump.


Three months into President Donald Trump’s second term and the recovery from the firestorm that devastated Los Angeles, Gov. Gavin Newsom finds himself at a precarious juncture.
The olive branch that Newsom extended to Trump in January, as Los Angeles reeled from multiple fires and the president threatened to withhold disaster aid, has yet to deliver on its early promise.
Once a leading voice in the anti-Trump resistance, Newsom traveled to Los Angeles and then Washington, D.C. to meet with the president and lobby for federal assistance. Trump rewarded his outreach with a détente — ceasing reference to the governor as “Newscum” and publicly promising that an “L.A. fire fix” was coming.
But amid ongoing battles over government funding, Congress has to date ignored Newsom’s request for $40 billion to rebuild Los Angeles.
Meanwhile, new political pressures are mounting. Increasingly furious with Trump’s dismantling of the federal government, Democratic voters are agitating their leaders to speak out — and even Newsom can no longer hold his tongue.
He made his most pointed criticism of the president’s agenda since before the fires when he sued last week to stop Trump’s sweeping tariffs scheme, calling it the “poster child” of stupidity. It appears to have unleashed Newsom’s confrontational side again, in a semi-profane announcement of another lawsuit to stop cuts to AmeriCorps and a commentary blasting the Trump administration for defying court orders that followed in the days after.
The stakes are incredibly high, not only for the future of Los Angeles but also for his gubernatorial legacy.
A policy shift that is ‘beyond alarming’
Newsom has sought to strike a balance that can protect his relationship with the president, whose backing will be critical to get any aid package through the Republican-controlled Congress. As he leans anew into the opposition, Newsom is training his ire on the Trump administration while largely avoiding mentioning Trump himself.
“We never want to make this personal. This is about protecting our values,” said Bob Salladay, the governor’s senior communications adviser.
But Salladay said the threats from the president, particularly the tariffs that could upend California’s entire economy, have reached DEFCON 2. Newsom can no longer sit out the fight, despite his ongoing prioritization of securing disaster aid for Los Angeles.
“There’s been a tone shift because there has been a policy shift from D.C. that is beyond alarming,” Salladay said.
It’s not the first time Newsom has had to find a way to set aside differences with his political nemesis for a state in turmoil.
Two days after Newsom won the governorship in 2018 with a campaign that made Trump his primary foil, the deadliest wildfire in California history tore through the town of Paradise. In between filing dozens of lawsuits against the federal government, Newsom also worked closely with Trump to guide California through the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.
But working with the president has become more complex than ever, said Mark Ghilarducci, who served as director of the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services from 2012 to 2022. While Trump always struggled to understand the complexities of disasters and provide an empathetic response, he’s become “very extreme in his second term,” Ghilarducci said.

In his first term, Ghilarducci said, Trump’s impulses were tempered by other high-ranking officials who were reasonable and experienced — experts with authority whom California could engage to ultimately to get what it needed.
When Trump rejected a major disaster declaration request in October 2020 for six wildfires burning across California, Ghilarducci said the Newsom administration made the case that the decision mostly hurt counties that supported the president and he promptly reversed himself.
“Now it’s really just slash and burn and destroy,” Ghilarducci said. “He’s surrounded by people who are much more enablers and sycophants.”
Ghilarducci said the political environment is the most challenging he’s seen in his four-decade career in disaster response. As Trump gleefully punishes his political enemies, his administration is eliminating departments and programs that would facilitate Los Angeles’ recovery, and Congress can barely pull together enough votes to keep the government funded.
“It’s something where you need a lot of savvy, strategic, thoughtful tradecraft to be able to navigate all the twists and turns,” he said.
Wildfire funds in the hands of Congress
The Newsom administration remains hopeful that Congress will approve a supplemental disaster relief package by this summer. Its $40 billion wish list includes money for debris removal, public infrastructure repair, housing reconstruction, economic development grants and small business loans.
The governor’s office could not provide a comprehensive list of disasters for which California has previously received supplemental disaster relief and how long it took to get the money. But a funding bill that furnished money to recover from the Camp Fire passed in June 2019, about seven months after the blaze ignited.
The bipartisan team of Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla and GOP Rep. Ken Calvert of Corona, with California’s entire congressional delegation behind them, is leading the push on Capitol Hill. Early demands to condition aid to Los Angeles on unrelated policies such as water management and voter identification appear to be waning, especially as discussions around a funding bill have broadened to incorporate subsequent disasters in red and purple states, including floods in Kentucky and wildfires in North Carolina.   
“From wildfires in California, to hurricanes in the Southeast, natural disasters do not distinguish between red states and blue states, and neither should our support for fellow Americans in their time of need,” Padilla said in a statement. “I will continue to push for additional disaster funding at every possible opportunity. I will also do everything I can to maintain bipartisan support for delivering additional relief for our state.”
Until then, California has a few more months of fiscal runway, because of a generous major disaster declaration that then-President Joe Biden signed immediately after the Los Angeles fires in January. That order authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency to reimburse 100% of the costs for cleanup, hazard mitigation and financial assistance for survivors for 180 days. After that, 75% of eligible emergency response costs are reimbursed.
But that account will eventually run out of money, requiring Congress to act to fund a longer-term recovery for Los Angeles.
“Just as all disasters are unique, requests to Congress and timelines are too,” Monica Vargas, a spokesperson for the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, wrote in an email. “Helping survivors and communities recover remains California’s priority.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021825-LA-FIRE-NEWSOM-JG-AP-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 15:15:52.595620

Delaware officials are working to fast-track the distribution of $14 million in federal funding to small businesses before the end of 2025, as part of the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). 
Governor Matt Meyer and Division of Small Business (DSB) Director CJ Bell announced the push during an event Thursday at The Mill in Wilmington, which has benefited from the program.
Delaware received $60.9 million from the U.S. Treasury Department under SSBCI, to be released in three stages. The first $20 million allocation must be at least 80% spent by the end of 2025 to unlock the next round. With only about $2 million distributed so far, state officials say they must move quickly to meet the target.
“To create quality jobs, small businesses and startups need access to critical funding,” said Governor Meyer. “I have repeatedly said that we will leverage these federal funds to support entrepreneurs, and we’re determined to get this money into the hands of Delawareans as fast as possible.”

DSB is branding the campaign “The Race to $14M” and unveiled a meter at its offices tracking funds distributed to date. The money is being deployed across four SSBCI-backed programs: two supporting loans and two focused on venture capital investments.
“This funding is key to empowering small business owners on two fronts,” said Bell. “The loan programs are best for small business owners who have credit challenges. These are what I call the ‘missing middle’ who still struggle to grow and scale. The venture capital programs will help us establish Delaware as a leader in the Innovation economy, where high impact startups bring the future to life.”
The loan programs—Loan Participation and Capital Access—aim to support businesses that may lack collateral or have limited credit histories, especially those in underserved communities. Rather than issuing funds directly, the state partners with local lenders like Del-One Federal Credit Union, True Access Capital, and Community Bank in Sussex County. The goal is to reduce risk for lenders and expand access to capital.
Business owners are first screened by DSB’s Regional Business Managers, who assess eligibility and connect qualified applicants with participating lenders. Entrepreneurs not yet ready for a loan are referred to the Small Business Development Center for technical assistance.
The Mill, one of the event’s hosts and a Capital Access program recipient, was highlighted as an example of the program’s impact.
“When Robert Herrera and I had the shared dream and Vision to create The Mill in Delaware, it was to create a home for entrepreneurs in this economy, a launchpad for them to take off, and a center for the entrepreneurial ecosystem,” said The Mill Co-Founder Chris Buccini.
So far, DSB has supported 21 loans under the SSBCI initiative, but officials say that won’t be enough to meet their $14 million goal. Attention is now turning to direct investments through the Delaware Accelerator and Seed Capital Program (DASCP), which offers up to $1 million to high-impact startups with fewer than 100 employees.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Former Pinellas County Republican U.S. Rep. David Jolly is making moves indicating that he is close to entering the Democratic race for Florida governor in 2026.
As first reported by Politico Thursday morning, Jolly, a political independent for the past seven years, registered as a Democrat Wednesday and simultaneously launched a state political committee, enabling him to begin raising money for a potential candidacy.
A former aide to Pinellas GOP Congressman C.W. “Bill” Young, Jolly served for nearly three years in Congress (2014-2017) before becoming a national figure as a cable news analyst for MSNBC.
As an indication of his intentions, Jolly has hired Democratic campaign strategist Eric Hyers as an adviser. Among the successful campaigns Hyers has been involved was Montana Gov. Steve Bullock’s re-election victory in 2016. That was the same year Donald Trump won that state by more than 20 percentage points.
“Eric Hyers has proven that he can help elect Democratic candidates in gubernatorial races in either red states or red-wave elections,” Jolly said. “And he may be the most talented political professional in the country today, so I’m excited that he’s agreed to advise on the entire 2026 cycle, and that includes whether I become a candidate or not.”
Jolly has been attending Democratic town-hall meetings since he announced that he was considering a run for governor a month ago, and he says those meetings have encouraged him to step back into the political arena. The intensity displayed in these events in reaction to the first months of the second iteration of a Trump presidency shows that Democrats have a chance to win back voters disaffected by the party in recent years, he said.
“Democrats are turning out and they’re showing up and they want to be active,” he said, adding that he has been asking for a show of hands of people who have never previously attended such events.
“Usually about a third of the audience is a first-time attendee, which shows that new voters and new converts, if you will, are excited about the Democratic Party. I will tell you that it is an enthusiastic Democratic party right now,” he said. “We talk openly about my prospects of running for governor, and I am incredibly encouraged by the kindness and the support that I get at these town halls, and obviously that goes into my decision making.”
Praise for Donalds
Republicans around the country have faced hostile crowds when they’ve hosted town halls this year, leading top GOP officials such as House Speaker Mike Johnson to advise that they don’t attend them.
One Republican member of Congress who hasn’t shown a reluctance to engage with his voters is Byron Donalds, the biggest name so far to enter the 2026 sweepstakes for governor in Florida. Jolly says that’s admirable.
“I commend Bryon Donalds for holding town halls,” he said. “I saw [Southeast Florida Republican Congressman] Brian Mast just had three, and one of the asks in these town halls is where is our member of Congress? And so kudos to Byron Donalds for showing up and having the conversation.”
The former Republican says he’s been watching closely the allegations over the past month regarding the Hope Florida Foundation, nonprofit arm of Hope Florida, the welfare assistance program connected to First Lady Casey DeSantis.
“We’ve already codified corruption in the state statute to allow it in many areas,” Jolly said. “Remarkably, this may be an area where the governor and First Lady have gone too far and even acted outside of what type of corruption is already allowed.”
Jolly has said that if he does enter the contest, the affordability crisis in the Sunshine State will be front and center of his candidacy. He also wants to talk about gun safety, which is back in the headlines following the shootings last week at Florida State University in Tallahassee.
“I think leaders sometimes have to lead in shaping public opinion and taking hard positions when you know it’s right. And you know, if you look at the website — and I’ve said this many times on TV — I support an assault weapons ban. 
“I think we need comprehensive and universal background checks, and what I mean by that is universal means every transaction — between families, gun shows, you name it. But comprehensive means more than what we’re currently checking. We basically currently check for a criminal conviction. I support the red flag laws. I think we should expand the Parkland package that was passed and what some Republicans want to roll back. I just think we need leaders to lead on reducing gun violence. It’s not that hard.”
Whomever the Democrats nominate as their gubernatorial choice in 2026, that candidate will be an decided underdog, as Republicans have won races for governor, senator, and president by more than double digits over the past two election cycles.
Republicans scoff
Republican Party of Florida Chairman Evan Power scoffed at the news that Jolly has joined the Democratic Party.
“It’s good to know Never Trumper and failed MSNBC analyst has found his true home in the irrelevant @FlaDems.” Power wrote on X. “I welcome him to run for Governor, the nearly 40% of the electorate that voted for @CharlieCrist deserve an equally bad choice this cycle.”
Leon County Democratic Executive Committee Chair Ryan Ray said that he welcomed Jolly to the Democratic Party and called it a “great sign of the emerging 2026 Democratic midterm wave that MAGA is already alienating longtime Republicans like David Jolly, turned off by the Constitutional chaos and economic damage of MAGA.”
Ryan wondered, however, how much support there might be for Jolly from elements of the party.
“Personally, I’ll be looking for a candidate with a longer track record of standing up against GOP extremism,” he said in a text message. “Party switchers have historically not won.”
Jolly said last month that he’ll likely announce his candidacy before June. “I remain very serious about it and will make a decision around Memorial Day, but certainly it is under the strongest possible consideration.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Three members of the Oklahoma State Board of Education said they weren’t aware of last-minute rewrites before they voted on proposed academic standards for social studies classes in public schools.
Board members Chris Vandenhende, Mike Tinney and Ryan Deatherage said during a meeting Thursday that state Superintendent Ryan Walters, who leads the board, had not informed them of significant changes made to the social studies standards before the board approved them Feb. 27. The approval vote sent the changed draft to the state Legislature for review.
Walters said he is responsible for new language added to the standards, some of which suggest there were “discrepancies” in 2020 presidential election results, but he rejected allegations that the board members weren’t provided the updated version in advance. If approved, the standards will dictate what topics public schools must teach to students in social studies courses.
Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday encouraged state lawmakers to take action on the proposed social studies standards while raising doubts about the integrity of the approval process. Deatherage has said he wants another chance to review and vote on the standards.
Vandenhende, Tinney and Deatherage, whom Stitt appointed in February, said they felt deceived and described the last-minute changes as a “bait and switch.” They complained they didn’t receive a copy of public comments on the standards nor were they given a red-lined draft showing what had changed in the text.

“It would have never dawned on me somebody would have changed them without telling the board whose duty it is to adopt them,” Tinney said during Thursday’s meeting.
Walters denied allegations the governor made Wednesday that the Oklahoma State Department of Education emailed the board members a different version of the standards from what the board ultimately passed. He called the matter a “fake controversy.”
“This was created by board members saying things outwardly, publicly that are simply not true,” Walters told the board, setting off a back-and-forth argument with the three new members.
Records the state Education Department provided indicate the board members were emailed the final version of the standards at 4 p.m. the day before their Feb. 27 meeting, which started at 9:30 a.m. 
Deatherage was the only board member to vote against the standards, saying during the February meeting he didn’t have enough time to review the lengthy document. He suggested delaying the vote by a week, but other board members disagreed.

“I really had no idea what’s in there,” Deatherage said Thursday. “I was not given time to go through those standards at that board meeting. I’m not a speed reader by any means.”
Walters said his administration provided the updated version in advance but he couldn’t make the board members read it. Delaying the February vote, he said, would have limited the time the state Legislature would have to review the standards.
Tinney said he read the original draft of the standards that the state agency posted in December for the public comment period. He said he didn’t know until after the Feb. 27 vote that the final draft was considerably different from the original version. 
Vandenhende said if he were aware of what he knows now, he would have voted against the standards. 
“The process is not a good process,” Vandenhende said.
The proposal would have failed to pass from the six-member board if Tinney and Vandenhende had joined Deatherage in voting against it in February.
Although public comments routinely inspire adjustments to agency proposals, the Education Department didn’t acknowledge any changes had been made to the standards after the public comment period nor did it publicly post the final draft until weeks after the board meeting. 
  State Superintendent Ryan Walters, pictured Jan. 28, said he made the decision to add new language to proposed standards for social studies. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)
The updated version suggests there were “discrepancies” in election results in 2020, including the “sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters and the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county’ trends.”
Walters said the language isn’t intended to support or deny the outcome of the 2020 presidential election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, but rather to encourage students to come to their own conclusions.
The original version of the standards made headlines by introducing Bible stories and teachings of Jesus that “influenced the American founders and culture.” The state’s current standards, enacted in 2019, make no mention of the Bible or Jesus.
Academic standards are reviewed and updated on a six-year cycle. They impact the topics taught in Oklahoma classrooms and the textbooks the state approves.
GOP majority in state Legislature unlikely to reject the standards
Despite the controversy, the standards appear to be on track to pass as written through the state Legislature. Leaders of the state House and Senate said their Republican majorities are unlikely to reject them.
Lawmakers have the option to approve, deny or amend the standards. If they take no action by May 1, the standards pass as written.

It “doesn’t look likely” that lawmakers will take a vote on the standards, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said Thursday.
“We’ve certainly had members digging into it and looking at it, but ultimately when you look at the standards themselves, we didn’t have consensus on items that we would want to revise or send back, at least not not at this point,” Hilbert said.
Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said the GOP majority in his chamber also is unlikely to reject the proposal.
Democrats in both chambers have filed resolutions to deny the standards in full.
Hilbert said he spoke with Walters on Wednesday night for an explanation of whether the board members received the final draft of the standards before approving them. He said Walters gave proof they received the updated version before voting.
“We vetted it pretty heavily, and we cannot find distinction between what the board received and what was ultimately voted on,” Hilbert said.
While raising questions about the inner workings of the standards approval process, Stitt alleged the Education Department emailed board members a different version from what their physical board packets contained.
“I think ultimately, I’m not saying those (standards) are good or bad,” Stitt said during a news conference Wednesday. “The Legislature’s going to have to make a decision on that, but the mechanics of how it came about really just feels — it feels like somebody needs to look into it, and we’re trying.”

(Photo by Manuel Balce Ceneta-Pool/Getty Images)A graduate student from the Republic of Ghana studying in central New Mexico says the U.S. government’s termination of his student status violates federal law and his constitutional right to due process.
The doctoral student and research assistant, identified only as K.O.D. in court records, moved to Socorro in August 2023, where he has been studying petrochemical engineering at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, according to court records. He received his bachelor’s degree at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in his home country and his master’s at the Politencnico di Torino in Italy, his attorneys wrote.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on April 9 abruptly terminated the student’s status in the Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) system, court records state. This means he faces potential immigration detention and deportation, his attorneys wrote.
“Losing my F-1 status puts my education, research, and career trajectory at risk, and I fear being forced to leave the country before I can complete by Ph.D. program,” the student wrote in a sworn statement included in court records. “This sudden disruption has made me feel vulnerable and anxious, not only about my immediate situation but also about the stability and direction of my life in the years to come.”
The student is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico and Shayne Huffman, an Albuquerque-based civil rights attorney, who on Wednesday filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico.
Both filings name Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Todd Lyons as defendants.
The motion for a temporary restraining order asks the court to block Noem and Lyons from terminating the student’s F-1 student status under the Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVIS) system.
“At the most elemental level, the United States Constitution requires notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard,” his attorneys wrote. “No such process was provided here with respect to the termination of student status.”
Huffman told Source NM the government hasn’t put forward any evidence to justify terminating his client’s student status.
“We believe that there can be no more egregious violation of someone’s due process than what has happened to our client, and for the other students that this has happened to as well,” Huffman said.
As of Thursday, the U.S. government has changed the legal status of more than 1,800 international students at more than 280 colleges and universities, including at least 10 in New Mexico, according to Inside Higher Ed.
DHS didn’t notify the New Mexico Tech student or his school, his attorneys wrote. He learned about the agency’s action against him when the school’s international programs coordinator informed him that they had discovered his student status had been terminated.
The reason given on the record of termination was “OTHER – Individual identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked,” according to a copy included in the restraining order motion.
However, the student has no criminal record, “without even minor infractions such as a traffic or parking violation,” has shown no violence in the U.S. or elsewhere and hasn’t participated in any protest either in-person or online, his attorneys wrote. Huffman said he has never faced any disciplinary action from the school whatsoever.
“It’s entirely unclear to us as to why he was targeted,” Huffman said.
Source NM left a voicemail for a New Mexico Tech spokesperson, and we will update this story as necessary.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
DHS has effectively disenrolled the student from his Ph.D. program and he can no longer work as a research assistant, which puts him in financial jeopardy because his financial aid, which is contingent on participation in the Ph.D. program, has been suspended, Huffman and ACLU-NM Senior Staff Attorney Becca Sheff wrote.
The status termination also prevents him from making progress in his doctoral program and obtaining his Ph.D., his attorneys wrote.
Twelve days after the student learned about DHS’ action, the school gave him a notice of “Graduate Contract Change or Cancellation,” saying his graduate contract was being terminated due to “immigration status currently revoked” by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
His attorneys wrote he likely accrues unlawful presence in the U.S. each day, which threatens his chance of reinstating his F-1 student status in the future.
The student is not challenging the revocation of his F-1 visa but, rather, is challenging DHS’s unlawful termination of his F-1 student status in the SEVIS system, his attorneys wrote. An F-1 student visa refers only to the document an immigrant student receives to enter the U.S., while F-1 student status refers to students’ formal immigration classification in the U.S. once they enter the country, they wrote.
The student lawfully obtained a visitor visa to attend a petroleum engineers’ conference in the U.S. in 2016 but customs officials didn’t let him in for five years.
“Just as the 2016 denial did not prevent Plaintiff from lawfully obtaining an F-1 visa in 2023, it cannot now serve as a legitimate basis for terminating his current status,” his attorneys wrote.
The student’s research is his passion and he has dedicated his entire life for the last two years to it, Huffman said, having authored or co-authored at least half a dozen publications and traveled the country to present at academic conferences.
“We’re a state that’s so reliant on energy, and he’s pushing forward the research in an area that directly impacts the state,” Huffman said.
Huffman said there are other Ghanaian students at New Mexico Tech. The school in October 2023 entered into an agreement with the student’s former school in Ghana to strengthen their petroleum engineering programs.
“With all the students that this is happening to, international students ultimately are a net positive for this country,” Huffman said. “They’re here to contribute in meaningful ways. They’re here to push research forward in the sciences or any other field. Our country and our state are better off with these international students here making their contributions.”

Hecklers interrupted a speech Thursday by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. at a conference on opioid addiction in Nashville.
The Rx and Illicit Drug Summit 2025 drew law enforcement officials, addiction prevention counselors, social workers and public health officers to the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center for the three-day event. 
For years, Kennedy has drawn ire and disapproval for his anti-vaccine messages and, more recently, for belittling comments about people with autism and budget cuts in his department. 
“Believe science!,” shouted a protester before security rushed him from the room.Another protester held aloft a sign that read, “Vaccines save lives.”
Kennedy’s speech was apolitical and focused on his own history in recovery from an addiction to heroin and his recommendations for dealing with the nation’s opioid crisis — many of which focused less on medical or treatment solutions and more on the need to build community, embrace spirituality and take personal responsibility.
After touting a $4 billion budget at HHS, Kennedy said that “money alone won’t fix this.”
“We have a whole generation of children who have lost faith in our country and their future,” Kennedy said. “Policy should reestablish hope for the future.” 
Alexis Pleus of Binghamton, New York, and another woman unfurled a banner saying “Cuts Kill” before being ejected. 
Pleus, who came to Nashville with other members of a group called Moms United to End the War on Drugs, lost her son to a drug overdose and said budget cuts at HHS spurred her attendance.

The Trump administration — and Kennedy — have proposed to restructure HHS, including dismantling the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), cutting research funding and funding for addiction treatment and mental health care. 
“All these changes are impacting people on the ground,” Pleus said. “People who are struggling with addiction can’t get help already and now they’re going to have an even harder time.”
The conference was sponsored by HMP Global, which provides continuing medical education. 
Past speakers have included former Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. President Donald Trump spoke to the group in 2019 during his first term in office. 
In addition to Kennedy, 2025 speakers included U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Tennessee senior U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn and Dr. Ralph Alvarado, commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Health.

Ron DeSantis speaking in St. Augustine on April 23, 2025.A high-profile inquiry by the Florida House into a charity associated with an initiative started by First Lady Casey DeSantis has abruptly come to an end, at least for now.
The investigation concerned a $10 million “donation” to the Hope Florida Foundation from health care giant Centene, but a top Republican said the chamber had learned enough to inform policy decisions the body needs to make during the regular legislative session.
The decision came after a trio of people Andrade asked to appear before the committee on Thursday refused to show — which he attributed to fear, given the stakes.
“$10 millions is a lot of money in the real world, right? If someone defrauded the state or a charity out of $10 million, they would go to prison,” he said.
The Hope Florida Foundation is a direct-service organization that helps serve the Hope Florida program, which aims to remove people from Medicaid and food assistance by connecting them with “navigators” in state agencies who work with faith-based communities and other private sector efforts to transition people to financial security.
Andrade, chairman of the House Health Care Budget Committee, said the House did not intend to subpoena anyone or force delivery of requested information. “Everyone and their mother knows what happened,” he told reporters.
 He criticized Attorney General James Uthmeier, who was chief of staff for Gov. Ron DeSantis at the time the foundation got the money that it subsequently sent to two political committees that then made substantial donations to a third committee battling a citizens’ to legalize marijuana. Uthmeier controlled the third committee, Keep Florida Clean.
The transactions were first reported by the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald.
“I’m a legislator making policy decisions, and I’m comfortable making the policy decisions based on the fact that James Uthmeier was involved, transferred this money illicitly, misled people and lied to people in the process, harmed several people in their jobs in the process, caused innumerable harm to several people, and that harm is not fully realized yet.”

Ten million dollars is a lot of money in the real world, right? If someone defrauded the state or a charity out of $10 million they would go to prison.


– Rep. Alex Andrade


The $10 million came from health care giant Centene in settlement of a legal dispute over overpayments of Medicaid pharmacy benefits. It was part of a larger $67 million settlement with the state in September 2024.
Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Shevaun Harris insisted that the $10 million wasn’t taxpayer money, but rather a donation in addition to the settlement payment, and so have other DeSantis officials.
Appearing at a press conference at a church in St. Augustine, DeSantis didn’t comment on the dropped investigation. Instead, he and First Lady Casey DeSantis touted the Hope Florida program once again, asserting that it has helped more than 30,000 Floridians reduce or completely eliminate their reliance on public assistance.
They asserted that the program would save taxpayers “over $100 million a year.” They have provided no documentation proving that, however. 
Casey DeSantis spoke extensively about the work done by Hope Florida, including  with the faith-based community. “What we are doing is good,” she said. “What we are doing is just. Sometimes you have to put on the full armor of God and you fight, because you know what you’re doing is righteous.”
Her only direct reference to the growing controversy was to say, “No matter what is written, don’t ever let politics get in the way of purpose.”
When asked by a reporter to comment about whether the $10 million came from Medicaid dollars, the governor said that documents released earlier this week by the the Florida AHCA “totally debunks the bogus media narratives that were out there.” 
“Why are they doing narrative?” he asked he said of news organizations. “They’re not doing it because they really care about that,” he said. “They’re doing it to try to impugn Hope Florida. They’re trying to smear this program. They don’t like working with the faith based community.”

Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia MercuryFrom building party infrastructure and strengthening candidate recruitment pipelines to supporting current candidates with tens of thousands in cash, both the Democratic Party of Virginia and candidates running in this year’s pivotal House of Delegates election are getting fresh infusions of funds and energy from national organizations. 
Thursday, the Democratic National Committee announced that it will transfer more than $1 million per month to its state and territorial parties over the next four years. Meanwhile the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee announced its spotlight investment on a slate of Democrats who are challenging Republican incumbents in Virginia’s statehouse.

House District 82 challenger Kimberly Pope Adams lost to Del. Kim Taylor, R-Petersburg in 2023’s election by just 53 votes and will face the delegate again with DLCC’s backing. 
As will House District 41 challenger Lily Franklin who nearly beat Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery, and House District 71 challenger Jessica Anderson who nearly ousted Del. Amanda Batten, R- James City County. Both women will step up to bat again in November. 
DLCC also announced support for House District 22 challenger Elizabeth Guzman, a former state delegate looking to get back into the legislature by ousting Del. Ian Lovejoy, R-Prince William, in the competitive district.
During Guzman’s previous tenure in the General Assembly she was tapped to deliver the Spanish language response to Donald Trump’s first State of the Union address during his first term in the White House. 
Now that he’s earned a second term and Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Virginia’s House of Delegates and state executive branch elections this year represent an opportunity for Democrats to hold onto their seats and claw back power at the state level.
DLCC pours money into Virginia races, citing ‘All eyes on 2025’

With $350,000 already invested in Virginia specifically as one of its priority states, DLCC plans to build on that number. 
“State Democrats in Virginia and across the country are holding the line against extremism in Washington,” DLCC president Heather Williams said in a statement. “All eyes should be on the commonwealth as competitive campaigns ramp up and voters prepare to hold Republicans accountable for their extremism this November.”
The focus on state-level gains is paramount for the party’s national apparatus as well. 
“When we organize everywhere to compete everywhere, we can win anywhere,” DNC chair Ken Martin told the media during a virtual call Wednesday morning. 
As part of the new investment strategy, he said that each state party is set to receive a minimum of $17,500 per month — up $5,000 from the current baseline. Republican-controlled states can also expect a total of $22,500 per month with a boost from the DNC’s Red State Fund. 
A politically purple state, this doesn’t apply to Virginia this time around, as the threshold for that funding source entails meeting at least two of three criteria: no Democratic governor or Democratic U.S. Senator; one-quarter or less of the state’s congressional delegation being made up of Democrats; and Republicans holding supermajorities in both state legislative chambers. 
Those factors are in flux, Martin and former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who was also on the call, emphasized, saying “there’s no such thing as a perpetual blue state or a perpetual red state.”
But in order to build Democratic gains within the D.C. beltway, Martin said, the DNC can help support states as they recruit and support candidates in bodies like state legislatures and city councils. 
“The role of political parties is to build infrastructure everywhere,” Martin said. 
With the fresh boosts from the DNC and DLCC, Democratic Party of Virginia Chair Lamont Bagby is ready to put the resources to work in this year’s elections. 
“We are committed to investing in every corner of the Commonwealth and mobilizing every voter to elect Abigail Spanberger as Governor, a Democratic Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General, and expand our majority in the House of Delegates,” he said in a statement to The Mercury.

(Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.

Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable – 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

Mike Kehoe withdrew the nomination of Tom Prater to the State Board of Education on Thursday after concerns circulated from a national advocacy group and a state senator.
Prater, a Springfield eye surgeon who donated $21,000 to Kehoe’s political action committee last year, was appointed in an interim capacity following the retirement of 33-year board member Peter Herschend. He was reappointed by Kehoe this year alongside three new board members.
But in the Senate Gubernatorial Appointments Committee hearing Wednesday, his selection was singled out by Republican state Sen. Mike Moon.
Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, said his constituents had complained about Prater’s appointment. He asked Prater about his role in United Springfield, a committee that has donated to candidates on both sides of the aisle in local elections.
Prater said the group didn’t look at political affiliations but asked questions about “education issues.”
Moon told The Independent on Thursday he spoke to Kehoe about his concerns but didn’t want to talk more about Prater or the reasons his nomination was withdrawn
If the Senate had voted Prater’s nomination down, he would have been banned from serving on the board for life. Instead, the nomination was withdrawn shortly after the Senate convened Thursday and the other education board nominee, Republican Brooks Miller, was confirmed on a voice vote. 
A spokeswoman for Kehoe did not respond to a request for comment. 
The State Board of Education, by law, can’t be dominated by a political party. Prater was nominated as an independent, with the maximum number of Republicans already in office or appointed.
Prater has a history of donating to both Republican and Democratic candidates, with the majority of his contributions benefiting those on the political right.
These donations came under scrutiny from the American Accountability Foundation, a D.C.-based nonprofit committed to the “American First conservative agenda,” according to its social media.
“If you want a pro-tax, anti-voucher, pro-teacher union voice on the State Board of Education, then Tom Prater is your guy,” the organization’s founder, Thomas Jones, said in an email to state officials Wednesday. “But if you want reform-minded conservatives, you’re going to need a new nominee.”
Jones noted Prater’s donations to ActBlue, which received $250 from Prater last year, and donations to local Democrats often below $1,000. 
Jones told The Independent Thursday that any donations to blue candidates are “terrible.”
“He shouldn’t be on the board at all,” he said. “He has donated to a bunch of terrible liberals in your state. He is going to be a toxic influence on the Board of Education.”
Missouri-based groups Freedom Principle MO and MO Education Watch celebrated the withdrawal on social media.
“The people won,” MO Education Watch said on X, formerly Twitter.
Prater did not respond to a request for comment.

Andrea Olsen, D-Missoula, seeks to study improvements to “passenger transportation service and public transit”A resolution for an interim study of public transportation moved forward in the House on Wednesday, passing a second reading vote 51-49.
Senate Joint Resolution 19, brought by Sen. Andrea Olsen, D-Missoula, seeks to study improvements to “passenger transportation service and public transit” with the requirement it’s reported during the next legislative session.
The resolution said some communities are poorly served by transit and that in general, public transportation is on the decline in Montana. It also specifically notes the state’s elderly population and issues with distance between where someone lives and their medical appointments.
“Basically the study looks at ways to improve passenger transportation, whether that’s air, bus, train, vehicle services, identifying where the need is and looks to further enhance and improve that so we stay connected as a community across the state,” said Rep. Denise Baum, D-Billings during a House floor session on Tuesday.

Baum is carrying the legislation in the House. She also carried legislation this session seeking to use railroad tax money to help fund the Big Sky Passenger Rail Authority. 
That bill failed in the Senate after lobbying efforts and questions around viability doomed the legislation. Just a handful of bills this session have touched on public transportation.
House Bill 764, brought by Rep. Brian Close, D-Bozeman changed the process of how urban transportation districts are created and expanded. 
The bill passed both chambers and would add a stipulation that anytime county commissioners want to expand a transportation district, a map of the proposed district would have to be added. It also adds language to the law making it easier for property owners in urban transportation districts but not receiving services to get out of them.

(U.S. Attorney's Office)Federal prosecutors announced new charges against three people in the Pittsburgh area, including a member of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard. They are accused of conspiring to vandalize a synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood and build improvised bombs.
Mohamad Hamad, 23, of Coraopolis and Talya A. Lubit, 24, of Pittsburgh were originally charged in November with conspiracy and defacing a religious building.
The new charges, made public in an indictment filed Tuesday, include a third defendant, Micaiah Collins, 22, of Pittsburgh, who is accused of conspiring with Hamad to make and set off homemade explosives. Attorneys for the three defendants, who were released after posting bonds, did not return calls Thursday.
Hamad, who enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 2023, is also accused of lying about his allegiances to Palestine and Lebanon during a military background investigation and possessing destructive devices.
The vandalism of Chabad of Squirrel Hill and the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh with anti-Semitic graffiti last July came about six years after a gunman killed 11 people worshiping inside the nearby Tree of Life building, which houses two synagogues.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to the indictment, Hamad and Lubit discussed plans to paint graffiti on “Jewish institutions” over the messaging app Signal in late July. Hamad purchased a can of red spray paint and met with Lubit early in the morning on July 29. They drove in Hamad’s car to Chabad where Lubit got out and painted “Jews 4 Palestine” on the front of the synagogue, the indictment says.
Lubit also painted an inverted red triangle, which the indictment alleges is a symbol used by the terrorist organization, Hamas, to designate a building as a target. On the same morning, the Jewish Federation reported to Pittsburgh police that its sign had been vandalized with a red spray-paint message that it “funds genocide” and “ Jesus, Hate Zionists.”
According to the indictment, Hamad was assigned to the 171st Maintenance Squadron based with the Pennsylvania Air National Guard’s 171st Air Refueling Wing in Moon Township, near the Pittsburgh International Airport.
As part of his duties in the squadron, Hamad sought a top-secret security clearance. He was interviewed in-person three times and allegedly made false statements about his allegiance to the United States. The indictment details how, during the background investigation, Hamad made numerous statements online that he was more loyal to Palestine and Lebanon than the United States.
It also says Hamad shared violent pro-Hamas videos and ordered clothing with the image of a Hamas leader and the message “Respect Resistance or Expect Resistance.” He also stated his desire to travel to Palestine to join the resistance against Israel’s attacks on Gaza.
In June, about a month before the graffiti incidents, Hamad started discussions with Collins using the encrypted messaging app Signal about building bombs. He also ordered chemicals and materials online and purchased a fuse at a fireworks store to build explosive devices, the indictment says.
In early July, Hamad drove from Pittsburgh to State College with the devices he had built. He and another person who is not charged or identified in the indictment drove to Rothrock State Park where they detonated the devices, the indictment says.

StebbinsAs Michigan works to build out its clean energy infrastructure to meet its goal of 100% renewable energy by 2040, panelists at the 2025 MI Healthy Climate Conference sat down to discuss the steps — and the hurdles — in achieving Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s goal of generating 60% of the state’s power from renewables by 2030. 
When looking at the biggest challenges in shifting Michigan’s energy grid away from fossil fuels to sources like wind and solar, energy developers and solar energy proponents focused on community sentiments as the biggest stumbling block.
Chris Kunkle, the vice president of government affairs for Virginia-based Apex Clean Energy, said the clean energy industry is facing a lot of headwinds from the federal government particularly during a time when energy demand is rising quickly.

However, energy policy is largely determined at the state level, Kunkle said, with Michigan’s 2023 clean energy package helping to alleviate previous difficulties in securing permits, allowing energy developers to pursue permitting at the state level if a municipality fails to approve or deny their application within a timely manner, or if local zoning boards either adopt standards stricter than the health and safety standards outlined in the law, or if they deny an application that complies with the standards outlined in the law.

“We were thrilled to see the state Legislature come up with a really novel approach where you’re required to try to go through the local process — and quite prescriptive about what that looks like —and if that falls apart for whatever reason, there’s an alternative route to go through the state and receive a permit,” Kunkle said. 
But, just like renewable developments in rural communities, these bills were hotly debated in the Legislature, as Republicans argued they stripped away local control in the zoning process. 
While the bills ultimately passed along party lines in the previous Democratic-led House and Senate, Republicans have since taken control of the House and Rep. Gregory Alexander (R-Carsonville) has introduced a pair of bills, HB 4027 and HB 4028, to repeal the changes to the permitting process. 
“Local governments and residents know their areas better than the state,” Alexander said in a press release. “They craft policies with this in mind, and people expect their elected local officials to make decisions for their communities and their families with their input at the forefront. When unelected state bureaucrats to come in, cast local input aside and impose projects onto communities, it’s a textbook example of government overreach. Our locals should be able to make decisions on property use for themselves, and these bills re-establish this critical element.”
Engaging with communities
Elise Matz, the vice president of public affairs for Circle Power, said that public acceptance of renewables was a challenge within the state, emphasizing the importance of engaging with the community on the benefits the project could bring. 
Matt Wagner, the manager of renewable energy development for DTE Energy, one of the state’s largest energy companies, said that the best advertisement for a company’s next clean energy project is the last project it finished. 
“If those projects go well, you know, we can point to them. It’s not just us pointing to them, it’s other communities and leaders saying, ‘Hey, you know, these guys did a great project over here. You can trust them.’ That’s our goal,” Wagner said. 
On another panel, John Freeman, executive director of the Great Lakes Renewable Energy Association, pointed to three main stumbling blocks in encouraging clean energy adoption: education, affordability and the disparity in access. 
“People are inherently nervous about big social change, and there’s nothing fundamentally bigger than transitioning from our current energy system to one that’s built around renewable energy. So we have to do a lot of education to make people feel comfortable with this change,” Freeman said, later pointing to the association’s efforts in teaching local governments how to develop a sustainability plan and bringing local officials up to speed on the benefits solar energy systems can bring to a community.

Ali Dirul, the chief executive officer of Ryter Cooperative Industries, which helps design and build solar energy systems, said oftentimes solar developments are done to communities, instead of with them. 
“A large solar farm is just plotted in the middle of somebody’s recreation area and then, you know, there’s upheaval, because it’s like anything, if somebody just slapped something in the back of your backyard, you’d ask some questions,” Dirul said. 
Community members are the ones who know what they need in their neighborhoods, Dirul noted, creating an opportunity for developers, funders, foundations and foundations to engage with them so that the community can actually benefit.
In the developers panel, the speakers highlighted Michigan’s renewable ready communities award, which provides communities who adopt renewable energy with $5,000 per megawatt of capacity to a maximum of $3 million as  a major motivator for communities. 
However, renewable energy may remain inaccessible to some families, Dirul said, using renters, people who live in multifamily homes, and those who do not have the money upfront for these kinds of projects as an example. 
  Ali Dirul, CEO of Ryter Cooperative industries discusses pathways to renewable energy adoption during a panel at the MI Healthy Climate Conference on April 23, 2025. | Kyle Davidson
One way to address these concerns is through community solar, Freeman said, allowing residents to buy or subscribe to individual solar panels in an array in order to save money on their energy bills due to the energy generated by the panels. However, these arrangements do not currently have a legal framework in Michigan, with Freeman calling for lawmakers to enact a community solar law. 
Economic hurdles
On the other panel, Kunkle further emphasized the impact that federal tariffs would have on procuring materials for battery storage and other clean energy efforts. 
Wagner similarly addressed concerns with navigating the supply chain as President Donald Trump implements and pauses tariffs. 
“When you’re ordering, literally, in some cases, not just tens of millions, but hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment, it’s kind of hard to be nimble and do that in a pause,” Wagner said.
“DTE was fortunate to get a lot of infrastructure in early and we warehoused it. We had no idea how smart we look now,” Wagner said, later noting that this was only a short term solution, with clean energy developers in need of more domestic supply. 
Kunkle also emphasized the importance of retaining clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, which face an uncertain future as Trump works to roll back climate efforts implemented under former President Joe Biden.
“If you do that, the price of energy goes up,” Kunkle said, explaining that companies who have committed to building out additional energy resources will still need to procure those resources even as prices increase. 
Both panels also discussed workforce development needs, and ways to cultivate clean energy jobs within Michigan communities and ensure that the energy workforce sees a just transition. 
Matz noted Circle Power’s strong relationship with the building trade workers in the Upper Peninsula, who she said served as major advocates for renewable energy efforts and helped change sentiments on a project from something that may or may not work, to something that is real and will be constructed safely. 
Wagner called for efforts to encourage renewable energy careers, noting that DTE partners with technical colleges across the state, noting that these jobs could help keep families together as young people look for opportunities out of Michigan. 
“[Parents] hated seeing their kids move away from Bad Axe or move away from other rural communities. It’s like, ‘How can you do something to help us bring them back?’ Well, There’s enough renewable energy development projects across Michigan that are going to be going in in the next 10 to 15 to 20 years. If some of these young people from these communities go and get trained, they can be back in their communities with a real, well-paying job. And when parents hear that, it just gives that hope they’re not going to lose their kids,” Wagner said.
Dirul noted that while there is no shortage of talent in Detroit to help build and operate clean energy systems, the one thing that is missing is access to training. 
“We want to ensure that everybody has access to these pipelines, to these educations, to these trainings, to these certifications, so that they can advance themselves, advance their careers and potentially become gainfully employed in the clean energy industry,” Dirul said. 
“We’re also looking to just expand beyond entry level jobs. Like, we should also look at management and entrepreneurship.… Not everybody’s going to get up on a roof and install solar, and for many people, that’s the one thing that will actually detract them from trying to get into the clean energy industry,” Dirul said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PXL_20210422_183518265-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-24 14:14:44.238046

Mike Braun.","Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith closes the voting machine for legislation making Indiana school boards partisan on Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana is set to join the handful of states running partisan school board elections after a squeaker of a final vote Thursday — pending a decision from Republican Gov. Mike Braun.
All 50 members of the Senate rushed to participate in the 26-24 concurrence tally, with one straggler bursting into the chamber just before Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith closed the voting machine. The GOP supermajority barely nabbed the constitutional minimum of 26 to avoid a tie-breaking vote from Beckwith, who presides over the Senate.
“My gosh, the wokeness they have in these school boards, even in Republican areas,” remarked Sen. Mike Young, R-Indianapolis. “If you don’t believe this harms our kids, look at our scores.”
“We don’t know who the best people are with the best philosophy and why shouldn’t we know that?” he asked. He was among those supporters who believe school boards are too liberal.
Forty-one states provide for nonpartisan school board elections, according to Ballotpedia. Five allow for either, depending on the district, and four do partisan elections.
Senate Enrolled Act 287 would add Indiana to the latter group by requiring partisan designations on general election ballots.
Opponents argued the changes would introduce or exacerbate partisanship in schools.
“We heard the quiet part out loud: this bill is about fear of … diversity of thought, fear of challenging the status quo,” said Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington. “Why else would we turn school board elections into party primaries? To push out the independent thinker, to challenge or to silence the community member who doesn’t check the right partisan box but knows how to lead with expertise, experience and integrity.”
Sen. Liz Brown, R-Fort Wayne, asserted the legislation attempts to “fix a problem that doesn’t exist in my community.”

“My four school boards — I can tell you probably within 90% certainty what I think their political affiliations are — but it’s never an issue,” she said. “… Those school board members focus on the policy and how to get our K-12 kids to where they need to be to be successful.”
Author Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville, said it actually “gives the voters what they want.”
“If you’re getting your phones lit up from the school board association or maybe the superintendents — the voters want this,” he told his colleagues just before the vote.
The measure would require nominating petitions to state the candidate’s political party affiliation, that the candidate is independent of a party, or that the candidate choses to be listed as nonpartisan. Partisan hopefuls would have letters next to their names on general election ballots, while independent and nonpartisan candidates would get blank spaces. Straight-ticket voting — in which voters can choose a party’s entire slate of candidates with a single ballot mark — wouldn’t apply.
But that’s not how the proposal originally accomplished its goal. It would’ve required school board candidates to run in partisan primary elections until House lawmakers stripped that out and resurrected their own pared-back language.
The Senate seemed inclined to agree to the House’s overhaul when it filed a concurrence April 1, but that was withdrawn April 10. Senators then voted to dissent. A conference committee, tasked with drawing up a compromise, met Monday — but on Tuesday, the dissent was rescinded and replaced with another concurrence.

That motion sat on the Senate’s calendar for two days. Byrne skipped it multiple times as lawmakers key to the vote were absent.
Much of the opposition, particularly among Republicans, centered on federal employees.
Sen. Eric Bassler feared the legislation would disqualify many of his constituents — his district hosts a U.S. Navy base — from running in partisan school board elections by implicating the federal Hatch Act.
“These are the exact people that this body should want to run for school board,” Bassler, R-Washington, said. “These are engineers. These are scientists. These are experts in finance.”
  Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville, defends his legislation making Indiana school boards partisan on Thursday, April 24, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
But the Hatch Act is “already in play today,” Byrne said.
He cited a January U.S. Office of Special Counsel opinion, which finds that an election labeled “nonpartisan” becomes partisan if a single candidate is endorsed by or “acts in concert” with a party.
When Brown asked him how, however, he replied, “I cannot tell you that.”
He said the legislation may bring “attention” to the Hatch Act so that “maybe it will come into play now more often.”
Indiana judicial staff could also be blocked from school board service under state rules.
The proposal retains another partisan feature.
A candidate claiming affiliation with a political party would have to meet Indiana’s two-party rule: the candidate’s most recent two primary votes must match the party sought to represent. If not, a county party chair’s O.K. is required. That could block thousands of Hoosiers from running under specific party designations.
A provision allowing for higher school board member pay remains. It nixes the current $2,000 maximum and instead ties compensation to 10% of starting teacher salaries. The state-mandated $40,000 salary floor would double school board pay to $4,000.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A federal judge rejected a former Kansas foster care leader’s request to leave the country, even though a Chicago faith leader vouched for him.
Robert “Father Bobby” Smith, who led Saint Francis Ministries from 2014 to 2020, faces federal charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud, and one count of money laundering. He asked the court last month to travel from his home in Johnson City, Tennessee, to El Salvador so he could visit his ex-wife and attend their daughter’s high school graduation.
U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse sided with a prosecutor who warned that Smith was a flight risk, based on family connections and the federal government’s inability to apprehend him if he stayed in El Salvador.
Pastor Corey Brooks, of New Beginnings Church of Chicago, wrote a letter dated April 10 to the judge in support of Smith’s request to travel.
“I have every confidence that his intent is to attend the graduation, celebrate his daughter’s success, and return to Tennessee,” Brooks wrote.
Brooks said he believes so much in Smith that he was willing to travel with him to the graduation.
But court records show Crouse denied Smith’s request at an April 16 hearing.
The judge also set a status conference for April 30. Past court filings showed Smith and co-defendant William Whymark, the former IT director for Saint Francis, are negotiating a plea deal.
The two are accused of defrauding Saint Francis, the largest foster care contractor in Kansas, of at least $4.7 million.
Saint Francis hired Smith, who had been ordained as an Episcopal priest by the Diocese of Chicago, as president and CEO in 2014. Kansas Reflector first reported on allegations of misconduct by Smith and Whymark shortly after they left Saint Francis in November 2020.

Idaho is among 50 states and U.S. territories that are seeking preliminary approval for the $39.1 million settlement with drug manufacturer Apotex in federal court in Connecticut, the Idaho Office of the Attorney General announced in a news release. A coalition of states last fall also announced a $10 million settlement with Heritage Pharmaceuticals. 
“When companies conspire to fix prices, real people pay the price — especially Idaho families who rely on affordable prescription drugs,” Labrador said in a prepared statement. “I encourage every Idahoan who purchased generic medications during the covered period to review their eligibility and seek compensation if you qualify. Our office will continue to defend the integrity of the market and ensure Idahoans are protected from corporate misconduct.”
People who purchased generic prescription drugs between May 2009 and December 2019 may be eligible for compensation in the settlement, the Idaho Attorney General’s Office said.

(Image courtesy of Pace-O-Matic) A Hanover County judge handed down a ruling Wednesday that could reshape the future of skill games in Virginia, siding with a convenience store owner who faced criminal charges for operating several Queen of Virginia (QVS2) skill machines.
Judge Hugh Campbell of the Hanover County General District Court dismissed the case against David Bogese, owner of the Breez-In Mart, after finding that the QVS2 devices at his store did not meet the legal definition of illegal gambling machines under state law. 
The ruling marks a significant victory for small business owners across the commonwealth who have fought to keep the machines in their stores amid legal ambiguity and political pressure from the casino industry.
“It feels good to get this decisive ruling today defending the right for small businesses to operate within the law,” Bogese said after Wednesday’s hearing. “Today is a victory not just for our case and our business, but for small businesses across the commonwealth to take part in our free market and against the overreaches of government. I am looking forward to getting back to business as usual.”
 The case and legal arguments

Bogese had been charged with a misdemeanor under Virginia Code §18.2-331, which prohibits possession of an “illegal gambling device.” 
The charge stemmed from the presence of four QVS2 skill games, developed by Georgia-based software firm Pace-O-Matic, at his store in Hanover County. Prosecutors argued that the machines violated the state’s gambling statute, which bans devices that require players to insert a coin, bill, ticket, token, or similar object to activate gameplay. 
But the defense countered that the QVS2 terminals in Bogese’s store did not require the insertion of any such object and were, therefore, fully compliant with Virginia law.
Attorneys Ryan McDougle and Bill Stanley — both of whom are also Republican members of the Virginia Senate — represented Bogese. They moved to dismiss the charge through a motion to strike the commonwealth’s evidence, asserting that prosecutors had failed to prove the QVS2 machines met the statutory definition of an illegal gambling device.
Judge Campbell ruled in favor of the defense, applying the “rule of lenity” — a legal doctrine requiring that ambiguities in criminal law be interpreted in the defendant’s favor. He found that because the QVS2 machine lacked any requirement for players to insert currency or objects into the machine, it did not qualify as a prohibited device under the law.
The judge also found that the statute itself was too vague, creating uncertainty for business owners trying to follow the law. His ruling echoed concerns raised repeatedly in recent years by small business advocates and gaming law experts.
A spokesman for Attorney General Jason Miyares, whose office was investigating the legality of QVS2 machines,  did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. 
 What are QVS2 games?

The QVS2 terminals represent a redesigned version of the Queen of Virginia Skill games that had become popular in bars, restaurants and convenience stores across the state. 
Unlike earlier models, which included slots-style mechanics and coin operation, the QVS2 machines are entirely cashless. Players must check in with a store attendant before starting a game, and no coin, cash, or other tangible object is inserted into the device.
The games were launched in Virginia in August 2024 by Pace-O-Matic, which said it developed the new model specifically to comply with Virginia law. The company also voluntarily raised the minimum age to play the games from 18 to 21 in anticipation of possible legislative changes.
Prior to rollout, the company consulted with several prominent legal experts, including former Virginia Attorneys General Jerry Kilgore and Tony Troy, who — along with regulatory attorneys Jason Hicks and Stephen Piepgrass — issued a joint legal opinion stating that the games were legal under current statutes.
At the time, the QVS2 devices were still in a beta-testing phase across Virginia, with limited deployment intended to assess their performance and regulatory fit. It is unknown how many of the machines are currently operating statewide. 
“Pace-O-Matic has consistently maintained that our QVS2 skill game is fully compliant with the plain language of the law in Virginia. We have never and will never operate outside the confines of the law, and this ruling affirms that,” Pace-O-Matic spokeswoman Rachel Albritton said in a statement Thursday. 
“While this is a significant legal victory for Pace-O-Matic, the real winners are the hundreds of small businesses across the commonwealth, many of which are family-owned mom-and-pop shops, that depend on income from skill games to survive. Furthermore, this legal win underscores Pace-O-Matic’s dedication to fostering a responsible gaming environment while providing legal gaming options that support small businesses.”
 Political and legal context

Skill games had existed in Virginia for decades in a largely unregulated space, but that changed in 2020 when the General Assembly passed legislation banning the devices. The move came amid concerns from some lawmakers and casino developers that the widespread use of skill games could undercut the profitability of newly approved casino projects.
During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the state granted a temporary reprieve, allowing skill games to remain in operation for one year to help small businesses survive the economic downturn. That reprieve expired in 2021. The Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority, which had been tasked with temporary oversight, ended enforcement efforts the same year, leaving skill game operators in legal limbo.
In the absence of clear regulations, businesses continued to operate the games until late 2023, when the Supreme Court of Virginia reinstated the state’s ban, reversing a lower court decision that had paused enforcement. That ruling once again cast uncertainty over whether businesses using newer skill games — like the QVS2 — were in violation of the law.
Earlier this year, during the 2025 legislative session, Virginia lawmakers weighed a series of proposals aimed at bringing regulation and structure to the skill game industry. 
Among them was Senate Bill 1322, introduced by Sen. Bill DeSteph, R-Virginia Beach, which proposed a $1,200 monthly tax per gaming device. The bill would have directed 70% of the resulting revenue to a new Elementary and Secondary Education Fund, with the remainder split among local governments, infrastructure projects and programs addressing gambling addiction. The legislation was ultimately referred to the budget process for further discussion.
DeSteph defended the measure by pointing to a previous effort under former Gov. Ralph Northam that generated $138 million in revenue from 11,000 machines. “This is the same model, to keep it simple,” DeSteph said at the time, noting added safeguards such as ABC-issued tracking stickers and geolocation key cards to enhance accountability.
Despite support from some lawmakers who saw the legislation as a way to raise revenue while introducing regulatory oversight, similar efforts faced resistance from Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who vetoed related legislation last year.
In a separate effort, Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, introduced SB 1287 to create an independent Virginia Gaming Commission that would oversee all forms of legal gambling in the state, excluding the lottery. 
The bill envisioned consolidating regulatory authority over casinos, sports betting and charitable gaming into a single agency, absorbing staff from existing state departments to improve oversight and reduce redundancy.
Supporters framed the proposal as a step toward modernizing and unifying Virginia’s gaming regulation.
“While I’m not a particular fan of gaming, I also face the reality that Virginia is becoming a gaming state,” said McDougle, addressing the Senate committee reviewing the measure. “We ought to have a little bit of a focus on how we’re doing that and make sure that we’re making good decisions.”
Ultimately, neither proposal made it into the revised budget lawmakers sent to Youngkin in February. While the governor has expressed support for establishing a gaming commission, he remains opposed to legalizing electronic skill games and has yet to endorse any plan that would bring them fully into a regulated market.
How Wednesday’s ruling in Hanover — which marked the first time a Virginia court has addressed the legality of the new QVS2 models in a criminal context — will impact future legislative efforts, remains to be seen.
The Virginia Merchants and Amusement Coalition (VA MAC), which represents store owners and game operators, issued a statement calling the ruling “a clear victory for small businesses.”
“Many of our members are operating legal QVS2 skill games as a means of supplemental income to keep their doors open,” said VA MAC President Rich Kelly. “Skill games give local small businesses, many of which are family-owned, additional income to pay wages, make improvements, and in some cases, keep the lights on.”
He added, “While we are thrilled with the outcome of this case, we continue to look forward to working with legislators on a solution to regulate and tax skill games in the future.”
Stanley, one of the two state attorneys representing Bogese, echoed that sentiment, framing the ruling as a blow to what he characterized as “casino-driven” efforts to squeeze small businesses out of Virginia’s emerging gaming industry. He said that the ruling should instill confidence in all small business owners who operate or want to operate skill games legally. 
“We’ve shown that the law, as written, does not prohibit these machines. Now it’s time for lawmakers to bring clarity through responsible regulation.”

(Photo courtesy of Santee Development Company)COLUMBIA — Orangeburg County residents asked legislators to greenlight a proposal to legalize a casino they argue would invigorate their area’s struggling economy.
Their pleas this week came in the first — and likely last — hearing in the House this year for three pro-gambling bills. The Ways and Means subcommittee took no vote, and the 2025 session ends in two weeks.
But the hearing alone signified a new willingness by Republicans to allow wide-open gambling in a Statehouse that has historically avoided even small changes to the state’s anti-gambling laws.
The bills considered Tuesday would legalize online sports gambling, categorize certain games of skill as not gambling and allow a casino off Interstate 95 bordering the town of Santee. The latter got the most attention at the two-hour hearing.
That bill starts by declaring that “casino gaming is not consistent with nor compatible with the economic, labor, or tourism industry profile for most communities in South Carolina,” but it is for the poor, rural area along I-95 that would benefit from the jobs and money a casino would bring.
Plans are already drawn up for a casino and resort near the southern shores of Lake Marion, with the expectation of bringing in tourists off two interstates to a rural area known for its golfing and fishing. (The property is just off I-95, a major East Coast artery, and only 10 miles from the intersection with Interstate 26.)
“This is an opportunity, a transformational opportunity, an economic opportunity, and it’s one that I believe that we cannot at this point ignore,” Rep. Jerry Govan, D-Orangeburg, told his colleagues.
The project brings an odd mix of players: It’s spearheaded by a GOP megadonor and sponsored by legislators of both parties, while opposed mostly by Republican legislators and groups that generally advocate for GOP initiatives.
While he didn’t attend the meeting, the real estate developer behind the plan, Wallace Cheves of Greenville, pledged not to seek any incentives, publicly funded infrastructure, or subsidies toward building a “world-class, billion-dollar destination resort and casino.”
“We strongly believe that this investment should be driven by private enterprise, not taxpayer dollars, ensuring no financial risk to the public sector,” Cheves said in an emailed statement. “That’s why we are fully committed to not seeking a single dime of local or state funding.”
The legislation’s wording allows a casino in any economically distressed county with I-95 running through it, if the county council approves. But Cheves stressed the legislation supports his “single-casino initiative.”
SC bill would legalize gambling on horse races. Don’t bet on it.

Gambling opponents
Those speaking against the proposal Tuesday included representatives of the South Carolina Baptist Convention and Palmetto Family Council — two groups that have fought pro-gambling bills in South Carolina for decades.
“It’s a moment of moral reckoning. The spread of gambling forces us to ask some tough questions,” Steve Pettit, president of the faith-based lobbying council, told legislators.
“These are systems that feed on desperation. They promise hope, but they deliver harm. They are built to profit from loss and to disguise addiction as opportunity,” he continued.
Other groups joining a letter of opposition sent to legislators ahead of the meeting included the Catholic Diocese of Charleston, which covers all of South Carolina; and Faith Wins America, founded by former state GOP Chairman Chad Connelly.
The Catawba’s decades of failed attempts
Also arguing against the bill was the chief of the Catawba Nation, which received its status as South Carolina’s only federally recognized tribe through a 1993 settlement. It allowed the Catawba to operate bingo games but otherwise put the tribe under the state’s anti-gambling laws.
And the Legislature has repeatedly refused to allow the tribe to operate anything approaching a casino.
That included efforts to build a high-stakes bingo parlor off I-95. The Catawba even went to court for permission to operate video poker machines on their reservation as a bargaining chip for the bingo parlor.
It didn’t work. Republicans didn’t budge, and the state Supreme Court ruled against the Catawba in 2007. They tried again and lost in 2014.
Now, Republicans are looking to authorize a casino in the same location where former GOP lawmakers refused to allow bingo — and give the authority to the developer who bought the property after splitting from the Catawba.
Cheves helped the Catawba buy land and develop a casino in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, before their relationship soured, and the National Indian Gaming Commission ruled in 2022 that their agreement violated federal law because Cheves’ company had too much power.
While the Catawba opened the Kings Mountain casino in 2021, the tribe still wants to operate in South Carolina.
“That’s helping our people, but it’s still not enough,” Catawba Chief Brian Harris said about the casino roughly 50 miles northwest of the York County reservation.
“We can do the same here, not only benefitting the Catawba people, but South Carolina as a whole,” he told legislators. “We could come together and correct the crooked past of our state regulations.
“They could have let the Catawba Nation do it 30 years ago, let them do it on that land 10 years ago,” he said of the Santee property now owned by Cheves.
A solution to poverty?
Harris noted that 18% of Catawba on the reservation in York County live in poverty.
The numbers are worse in Orangeburg County, where 22% of residents live in poverty, and the median household income is $43,200, according to census estimates for 2023.
Cheves, owner of the Santee Development Company, said he intends to “revitalize and transform an economically challenged region of our state” with “thousands of good-paying jobs, driving tourism, and expanding business opportunities for local communities.”
Construction costs alone are expected to top $600 million, not including design and site work expenses, according to an economic analysis provided to the Gazette from The Innovation Group, a gaming and hospitality consulting firm.
Bishop Hayes Gainey with Faith Group 4 Action, which advocates for living improvements in the city and county of Orangeburg, said a casino in Santee would “eradicate a whole lot of poverty” in the county.
“That will create a power base in our economy, that will create opportunities for many citizens in Orangeburg County and the surrounding areas,” he said. “But most importantly, it will give hope where there’s a lot of people in despair.”
Scott Peavy, who operates Team Polebender Fishing Adventures in Santee, said he loves the area, but the economy is stale.
“There’s been no change whatsoever in Santee and Orangeburg County for years,” he said. “The economic impact that this casino would make for that area would be phenomenal.”
Douglas Walker, a College of Charleston economics professor who consults for the gambling industry, estimated that the state could collect $70 million to $100 million annually in tax revenue from the casino.
“Fundamentally, I think it comes down to a question about, do you want people to be able to do what they want to do?” said Walker, whose firm is called Casinonomics Consulting. “It’s a matter of choice, and a lot of people just enjoy the activity of gambling.”
While the casino bill and others legalizing gambling likely won’t get any traction before the session ends May 8, they stay alive for consideration next year — an election year for every House member and statewide office.
But the odds aren’t good for next year either.
Even if the legislation manages to make it through both chambers, gambling bills face a likely veto from Gov. Henry McMaster, who’s made it clear his longtime opposition to gambling hasn’t changed.
“Gambling is bad for our culture,” McMaster told reporters earlier this month. “It’s not part of our heritage and there are better ways to make money, to give jobs, to generate tax money, to generate a thriving economy.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SanteeRendering-1-e1745512490653-1024x565.jpg,,,2025-04-24 13:14:46.303503

Ruth Canovi, the association’s director of advocacy in Connecticut, said year after year, Fairfield County used to have the worst ozone pollution east of the Mississippi.
“This year, actually, there was one metro area that has worse worsening ozone than we do,” she said. “But that’s not because we’ve improved. That’s because they worsened.”
Cook County, Illinois, is now at the top of this unfortunate list.
“Fairfield County has certainly the worst ozone pollution, or smog pollution, in all of New England,” Canovi said.
Ozone smog and daily particle pollution worsened in the New Haven, Hartford and the Waterbury metro area, according to the report. Unhealthy days for short-term particle pollution more than tripled in Litchfield County.
“Both ozone pollution and particulate matter pollution … they’re two of the most widespread and dangerous air pollutants,” Canovi said. “They can cause asthma attacks, respiratory and cardiovascular harm, including heart attack and stroke and even early death.”
Even relatively low levels of ozone can cause health effects, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Fairfield County accounts for about 25% of Connecticut’s population. Compared to the rest of Connecticut, according to the report, the county had the most pediatric asthma cases (15,463); adult asthma (81,758); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (35,190); lung cancer (537); and cardiovascular diseases (56,117).
‘The air quality has gotten worse’
Across Connecticut, people working in outdoor jobs, like construction and landscaping, and unhoused populations and those living close to highways and industrial sites continue to be disproportionately impacted, said Dr. David Hill, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Waterbury Hospital.
“The air quality has gotten worse and more patients are coming in with increased trouble breathing on hot and humid days, when the air quality is worse,” he said.
Hill recalled higher patient volumes and new onset asthma during the Canadian wildfires in 2023, and is concerned by the current wildfires in New Jersey.
More than 125 million people live in U.S. counties with “F” grades for ozone smog. And 93 additional counties earned an “F” in this year’s report (2021-2023 data), according to the American Lung Association, which has published its annual air quality data since 2000.
This annual “report card” tracks exposure nationwide to unhealthy levels of ozone and particle pollution. The latest data showed that 77 million people in the U.S. — more than one-fifth of the nation’s total population — live in counties with “F” grades for particle pollution.
Climate change to blame 
Canovi said climate change takes much of the blame.
“The Clean Air Act was passed in the 1970s, and the air has gotten better,” she said. “However, we know that climate change is making it harder for us to clean up the air, so we really need to do all that we can to reduce emissions from fossil fuel sources.”
Canovi urged people to pay attention to air quality. “We want them to take precautions when they know their health is at risk,” she said.

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)As climate change drastically increases the frequency and severity of wildfires, power companies say they’re facing growing risk for payouts that could bankrupt them or require massive rate hikes on customers.
Across the West, electrical utilities are pushing state lawmakers to grant them legal immunity or limit damage payouts if their equipment sparks a blaze.
They’re backing bills, which have passed or been proposed in at least eight states over the past few years, that would require the utilities to follow plans to limit their risks of causing a fire, such as trimming trees or burying power lines. In exchange for taking those steps, lawmakers would give utilities protection from lawsuits that could expose them to billions of dollars in damage claims.
“We’re only one wildfire away from bankruptcy,” said Shawn Taylor, executive director of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association, a group that represents electrical cooperatives. “Even if we avoid bankruptcy, we’d have huge rate increases to cover the cost of a lawsuit.”
Already, utilities are facing soaring insurance premiums because of the magnitude of claims they would face if they caused a fire. Taylor and other industry leaders argue that power companies should be granted relief if they take actions to limit their risk.
In 2019, Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California declared bankruptcy over its roughly $30 billion liability from a series of wildfires caused by its equipment, including the devastating Camp Fire. And in Oregon, PacifiCorp is facing billions of dollars in damage claims due to its role in the state’s 2020 Labor Day fires. PacifiCorp has been a key player backing liability bills in five states, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported.
The proposals face strong opposition from wildfire victims, insurance companies and trial lawyers. Those groups say the bills don’t do enough to protect residents from dangerous electrical infrastructure. And insurers say their own customers could pay the price if lawmakers protect utilities.
“When you push in one side of the balloon, it comes out somewhere else,” said Greg Van Horssen, a representative for State Farm Insurance, delivering testimony before the Montana House Judiciary Committee in February. “If we have a problem with recovering costs for burnt-down houses in Montana, from an insurance company’s perspective, we only have one option, and that’s to raise the rate of homeowners’ insurance.”
Utah became the first state to limit utilities’ liability when it passed a law in 2020. The law protects companies from negligence charges if they have a wildfire mitigation plan in place, and it puts limits on the damages victims can collect, using a fair market value figure that can fall well short of the full cost to rebuild.
This year, Idaho and Wyoming have enacted similar measures, and lawmakers in Montana and North Dakota have sent proposals to their governors. A bill in Arizona has cleared the House, and an Oregon measure is still in committee. Alaska has also considered liability legislation in recent years.
Utah state Rep. Carl Albrecht, a Republican who sponsored that state’s liability law, said it has compelled power companies to trim trees, bury lines and take other steps to ensure they are complying with their safety plan. He said utilities are frequent targets of litigation.
“People look at the utility as deep pockets that can pay out a lot of damages,” he said. “It’s whoever has the best attorneys and can sell their case in court.”
Michele Beck, director of the Utah Office of Consumer Services, serves as an advocate for Utah energy customers. She said it’s difficult to protect electrical customers and wildfire victims at the same time.
“The costs for ratepayers are substantial, and it’s reasonable to try and find a balance between these extremely high jury awards,” she said. “I admit, it’s a devastating loss for people who are impacted [by wildfires], but somebody is also paying on the other side.”
In Oregon, consumer advocates are similarly torn.
“It is a difficult place to be, having utilities close to bankruptcy and unable to make investments that are necessary to provide service,” said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a nonprofit representing ratepayers. “At the same time, the principle that customers shouldn’t be bailing out utilities for bad practices is a critical standard.”
PacifiCorp says it faces more than $45 billion in liabilities, much of that driven by the 2020 Labor Day fires in Oregon. Multiple juries have found the company liable for failing to cut power to its lines. The massive costs PacifiCorp is facing have limited the company’s ability to invest in its infrastructure and clean energy, Jenks said. PacifiCorp did not grant a Stateline interview request, but the company has been involved in shaping legislation across several Western states.
Oregon state Rep. Pam Marsh, a Democrat, said her bill would not give utilities legal immunity. It would establish a certification process to ensure utilities are mitigating wildfire risk.
“The utilities need somebody else to help them identify the risk they’re carrying,” she said. “We never meant that if you got a safety certification in April that you’re bulletproof over the next year for any sort of wildfire liability.”
But some legal experts told the Oregon Capital Chronicle that utilities would likely use their compliance with the certification process in a legal defense against wildfire claims.
In Arizona, a liability measure has passed the House and advanced in a Senate committee. The bill would protect companies from lawsuits if they follow mitigation plans. Utility leaders say it’s necessary to ensure they can continue providing service.
“Unlike other businesses that might stop doing business in an area where risk has grown too high, we have an obligation to serve customers,” said Joe Barrios, senior media relations specialist with Tucson Electric Power. “Wildfire liability costs and higher insurance costs are passed along to customers through the rates that they pay. [This bill] helps to maintain service affordability.”
But state Rep. Alex Kolodin, a Republican, believes the proposal violates a state constitutional provision that bars the state from limiting residents’ right to sue. And he said that limiting utilities’ liability will reduce their incentive to take safety measures.
“I wouldn’t want to be the legislator who voted for this, and then the utility causes a fire that burns down 200 houses in my district,” he said. “Then I have to explain to my constituents why they can’t recover any damages. ‘Sorry, guys, it’s because your legislator is an idiot.’”
Brandon Vick, a regional vice president with the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies trade group, said utility groups have made a coordinated push across several Western states this session. He noted that more and more residents in fire-prone areas are going without insurance coverage, leaving them with no recourse if they can’t seek damages from a utility.
“Utilities are rightfully concerned that they’re gonna do something that causes a catastrophic wildfire,” he said. “The question we’ve been posing is, who should be responsible when that ultimately happens? [These bills] are really pushing that liability onto the people who can least afford it.”
Several states are also considering a wildfire fund similar to the one California enacted in 2019. Such measures allow utilities to set aside money, funded by a mix of rate increases and shareholder contributions, which they can later tap into to help cover damages caused by wildfires.
Marsh, the Oregon lawmaker, said her proposal would allow wildfire victims to quickly access funding to rebuild their lives. Residents would still have the option to forgo payouts from the fund and sue utilities for full damages. The bill died in committee amid opposition from wildfire victims who characterized it as a bailout for utilities.

Read this story in English.
El Gobernador Ned Lamont promueve un plan que ofrecería educación preescolar gratuita o a precio reducido a numerosas familias de Connecticut. Este plan es uno de varios proyectos de ley que los legisladores están considerando para mejorar el acceso a la educación infantil temprana.
El tema cuenta con un amplio apoyo de legisladores, padres, defensores y miembros de la comunidad empresarial. Esto se debe en parte a que la pandemia de COVID-19 puso de relieve la urgente necesidad de cuidado infantil para muchos, incluido Lamont, y fue el catalizador para que creara un Panel de Apoyo para estudiar el tema. Sin embargo, financiar el acceso de más familias a guarderías y mejorar los salarios de los trabajadores del sector es una propuesta costosa.
Esto es lo que debe saber.
¿Calificaría mi familia para el plan de preescolar del gobernador?
Depende de los ingresos de su hogar. Las familias que ganan hasta $100,000 al año no pagarían nada por preescolar. Las familias que ganan hasta $150,000 al año pagarían solo $20 al día. Sin embargo, los hogares que ganan más de $150,000 al año seguirían pagando de su bolsillo el preescolar, a menos que tengan acceso a escuelas en un distrito que ofrezca plazas, como New Haven y Hartford.
¿Qué medidas tomaría el plan del gobernador para el cuidado de bebés y niños pequeños?
Actualmente, el plan del gobernador no cubre el cuidado de bebés y niños pequeños, solo para niños de 3 a 5 años. Si bien los defensores afirman que el cuidado de bebés y niños pequeños es fundamental para las familias de Connecticut, especialmente para ayudar a las empresas a cubrir más de 90,000 vacantes en todo el estado, muchos aún apoyan el plan de Lamont porque, según ellos, representa un gran paso en la dirección correcta.
Además, según los defensores, el plan de Lamont mantendría la integridad del sistema de cuidado infantil que existe actualmente al mejorar los salarios de los trabajadores de las guarderías, a la vez que aumenta la capacidad y las plazas en las escuelas públicas.
¿Cómo inscribiría a mis hijos en el plan de preescolar de Lamont?
Los legisladores prevén un nuevo portal que proporcionaría información de fácil acceso para que los padres puedan consultar rápidamente todas las opciones de preescolar disponibles. Actualmente se están considerando proyectos de ley que proponen esta solución, incluyendo el Proyecto de Ley de la Cámara de Representantes 5003, un plan más integral para apoyar la atención a la primera infancia, y el Proyecto de Ley de la Cámara de Representantes 7044, que se centra en la creación del portal en línea.
¿Cuándo estarán disponibles estas plazas adicionales de preescolar?
La Comisionada de la Oficina de la Primera Infancia, Beth Bye, afirma que se añadiría un número significativo de nuevas plazas de preescolar subvencionadas para 2028 y que, para 2032, la gran mayoría de la población de preescolar de Connecticut tendría acceso. Estas plazas se distribuirían entre centros de cuidado infantil, escuelas públicas, hogares de cuidado infantil grupal y hogares de cuidado infantil familiar.
¿Cómo financiaría Connecticut todas estas nuevas plazas?
Según el plan de Lamont, hasta 300 millones de dólares de fondos excedentes se destinarían a un Fondo Universal de Dotación Preescolar. De esa cantidad, 30 millones de dólares podrían gastarse en el próximo año fiscal, y el 10% de la dotación sería elegible para gastarse cada año a partir de entonces. En su discurso sobre el presupuesto, Lamont declaró con optimismo a los legisladores: “Nuestro presupuesto anticipa casi mil millones de dólares en la dotación durante los próximos años, si Dios, la economía y el presidente Trump lo permiten”.
¿Qué otros planes hay sobre la mesa?
Los legisladores también están considerando otros planes para la educación preescolar. El Proyecto de Ley 1 del Senado implicaría un enfoque de cuatro fases que eventualmente cubriría no solo la educación preescolar, sino también el cuidado de bebés y niños pequeños. Al igual que la propuesta de Lamont, se basaría en fondos excedentes. La primera fase de esta propuesta exigiría un modelo de “triple participación” en el que se pediría a las empresas que contribuyeran al costo del cuidado infantil para sus empleados, pero la participación sería voluntaria. Otro plan, el Proyecto de Ley 5003 de la Cámara de Representantes, busca permitir que más hogares califiquen para Care4Kids, ampliaría el fondo de subsidio para el cuidado infantil, brindaría apoyo a los trabajadores de cuidado infantil y ayudaría con las renovaciones de las instalaciones de cuidado infantil. Por último, el Proyecto de Ley 1369 del Senado proporcionaría asistencia financiera a las familias trabajadoras para pagar el cuidado infantil, mediante un nuevo impuesto sobre la nómina del 1.5% para las grandes empresas con fines de lucro.
¿Por qué este tema se ha convertido en una prioridad?
Durante la pandemia de COVID, el acceso a servicios de cuidado infantil asequibles y de calidad cobró protagonismo. De repente, los trabajadores médicos y otros trabajadores esenciales de Connecticut se quedaron sin cuidado infantil. La defensora Eva Bermúdez Zimmerman afirmó que el COVID “creó una realidad distópica” en la que los trabajadores renunciaban a diestra y siniestra porque simplemente no había cuidado infantil disponible y la necesidad de cuidado infantil para la supervivencia de la fuerza laboral se hizo repentinamente evidente.
En 2023, Lamont creó un Panel de Expertos para estudiar el cuidado infantil. El proyecto de ley que los legisladores están considerando es resultado del informe del panel, que concluyó que el sector enfrentaba muchos problemas simultáneamente, desde los bajos salarios de los cuidadores infantiles y los maestros de preescolar, hasta la falta de transporte en algunas regiones rurales y el horario limitado en los programas de las escuelas públicas, lo que imposibilitaba a los padres trabajar y recoger y dejar a sus hijos. El plan del gobernador pretende abordar todos estos problemas.
Con tantos recortes federales, ¿habrá realmente suficiente dinero en el presupuesto estatal?
Esa pregunta aún no tiene respuesta. Con los significativos recortes federales a todo tipo de programas, desde bibliotecas y museos hasta servicios de apoyo para personas sin hogar, y las amenazas a Medicaid y Medicare, es lógico que los superávits previstos cuando se redactó el plan no estén disponibles.
Cabe destacar que Lamont ha mantenido el plan a pesar de toda la conmoción de los últimos meses. Al ser preguntado en el evento “In the Room” del Connecticut Mirror, que incluyó una entrevista personal con el gobernador el 26 de marzo, sobre qué problema solucionaría en el estado si pudiera solucionar algo, Lamont mencionó la educación, en concreto la primera infancia. Al igual que la reducción del déficit de las pensiones, Lamont planteó el tema como una parte clave del legado que podría dejar.
“Creo que si haces eso, al final has dejado huella y marcado la diferencia”, dijo.

Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Services, known as IRIS, operates a 5,000-square-foot warehouse and food pantry on Hamilton Street. The site feeds more than 650 families.
However, earlier this year, the Trump administration cut $4 million, which the federal government used to contribute to their annual budget of $15 million.
[RELATED: Refugee resettlement in CT at risk as executive orders upend IRIS]
Now, the privately funded, community-service run Community Soup Kitchen will pay IRIS’s $4,000-a-month rent, and the two companies will share the space.
Gregory DePetris, CSK’s board chair, said the partnership would be mutually beneficial.
“Food insecurity in our city is rising. Public funding to support emergency food providers is increasingly unpredictable. And that’s exactly why the partnership with IRIS matters so deeply,” DePetris said. “It’s a practical and powerful response to a growing need.”
“Because federal funding is cut, it does not stop our care for the people that we serve, and this partnership is a demonstration of that commitment,” IRIS Executive Director Maggie Mitchell Salem said. “When we have to reduce operating costs, we look around for partnerships that allow us to continue serving.”

State and local officials, including Mayor Justin Elicker (D) and Governor Ned Lamont (D) visited the site on Wednesday, as community members picked up their food.
“I just think that Community Soup Kitchen and IRIS are exactly what makes America great,” Lamont said. “And sometimes Washington forgets that, as they are right now.”
Lamont listened as IRIS food pantry manager Johanna Snyder went down the list of how much surrounding states contribute to combating food insecurity: $30 million in Massachusetts, $35 million in New York and $85 million in New Jersey.
Connecticut spent $850,000 last year.
Snyder wants state lawmakers to pass H.B. 7021, which would allocate $10 million to DSS for Connecticut Foodshare. The organization buys and distributes food to the state’s pantries.
“We’re going to do what we can within the context of an honestly balanced budget,” Lamont told reporters after the event.

,DC,2025-04-24 16:15:57+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Tax policy, Medicaid funding cuts could scuttle Republicans' ‘big, beautiful bill’","Jennifer Shutt, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/tax-policy-medicaid-funding-cuts-could-scuttle-republicans-big-beautiful-bill,,"WASHINGTON — Republicans in Congress have a difficult few months ahead of them as they look to broker agreement within their exceptionally narrow majority on policy issues that have already begun to divide centrists from far-right members of the party.The negotiations will be the first test of the sort for Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who weren’t in the top posts eight years ago when the GOP passed its last reconciliation package.Tax law and funding cuts to Medicaid are the issues most likely to prevent one “big, beautiful bill” from moving through both chambers and reaching President Donald Trump’s desk.Republican leaders will also need to be cautious as the package takes shape about what types of proposals their more vulnerable members vote on, especially if they hope to hold onto at least one chamber of Congress following next year’s midterm elections.“The swing-district Republicans are in a tougher spot because their voters do want to see some of those tax cuts extended, but they don't want to see it at the expense of programs like Medicaid,” said Dr. Ben Sommers, Huntley Quelch professor of health care economics at Harvard.“And so they're walking a tightrope,” he said. “And at least until there's a final bill on the floor, a lot of them are going to just keep pushing that final decision down the road and hope that something else happens and that they don't have to make that tough call.”The decision to bundle together a permanent extension of the 2017 tax law, hundreds of billions in new spending on border security and defense, a rewrite of the nation's energy policy and spending cuts means that centrist Republicans will have to cast one take-it-or-leave-it vote.Breaking up the sweeping package into two or more bills would have given at-risk Republicans the opportunity for more tailored votes, but GOP leaders ultimately rejected that idea — a choice that will put moderates under increasing pressure as the legislation takes shape in the coming weeks.Democrats in both chambers are expected to unanimously oppose the package.Normally that would present a challenge in the Senate, where 60 votes are usually needed to limit debate on a bill and move onto final passage. But GOP leaders are using the reconciliation process to pass their bill, meaning they only need the support of a simple majority in the Senate. Slim marginsHouse committee chairs are expected to release and mark up 11 bills after the chamber returns from a two-week break in late April, though that’s only the first step.Once the pieces are all bundled into one package, it will need to get across the House floor without losing more than three Republican votes, a much narrower threshold than the dozen GOP lawmakers in that chamber who voted against the final version of the 2017 tax law.Republican leaders will then need to keep the party from making significant changes to the package in the Senate, where lawmakers will be able to offer as many amendments as they want when the bill comes to the floor.That vote-a-rama will test party unity, with Democrats likely to propose amendments re-writing or eliminating specific sections of the bill — especially those addressing tax provisions benefiting the wealthy or corporations, and Medicaid spending cuts.If more than three Senate Republicans break from the party to alter various elements, it could endanger final approval. However, if GOP senators from swing states vote to keep unpopular provisions in the bill, it could lead to them losing their next reelection bid to a Democrat.Difference of opinion on MedicaidThe disagreement between centrist Republicans and far-right lawmakers over potential spending cuts to Medicaid is already on full display.During floor debate on the budget resolution that cleared the way for Republicans to write the massive reconciliation package, Texas Rep. Chip Roy excoriated the state-federal health program for lower income Americans and some people with disabilities.“Medicaid is debilitating the vulnerable, not helping them,” Roy said. “We are shoveling money out to the able-bodied on the back of expansion of Obamacare.”On the other ideological side of the conference, a group of 14 centrist House Republicans sent a letter to GOP leaders a few days after voting to adopt the budget resolution to announce they “cannot and will not support a final reconciliation bill that includes any reduction in Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations.”“Cuts to Medicaid also threaten the viability of hospitals, nursing homes, and safety-net providers nationwide,” they wrote. “Many hospitals — particularly in rural and underserved areas — rely heavily on Medicaid funding, with some receiving over half their revenue from the program alone.“Providers in these areas are especially at risk of closure, with many unable to recover. When hospitals close, it affects all constituents, regardless of healthcare coverage.”Failed Obamacare repealRepublican leaders in Congress will want to avoid a repeat of the last time the party tried to overhaul health care in a reconciliation package.During Trump’s first term, following years of GOP politicians pledging to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, they sought to do just that through the same complex reconciliation process they’re using now.Ultimately, twenty Republicans voted against the bill in the House and three GOP senators — Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, Arizona’s John McCain and Maine’s Susan Collins — blocked that chamber’s repeal-and-replace bill.Collins said in a floor speech at the time she voted against the House’s version of the bill for several reasons, including that it would have made “sweeping changes to the Medicaid program — an important safety net that for more than 50 years has helped poor and disabled individuals, including children and low-income seniors, receive health care.”Murkowski wrote in a statement that she voted against the Senate’s so-called “skinny” repeal bill because “both sides must do better on process and substance.”“I know that access to affordable care is a challenge for so many. I hear from fishermen who can’t afford the coverage that they have, small business owners who can’t afford insurance at all, and those who have gained coverage for the first time in their life,” Murkowski wrote. “These Alaskans have shared their anxiety that their personal situation may be made worse under the legislation considered this week.”Medicaid cuts could hurt state budgetsGOP lawmakers in Congress won’t be the only members of the party that leaders need to keep in the fold. Republican governors may not have a vote in either chamber, but they do have considerable sway with their congressional delegations and many red states have a substantial percentage of their Medicaid programs covered by federal dollars.Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo released a letter last month seeking to assuage fears about potential federal cuts to Medicaid, writing that he was “actively engaged in conversations with the White House and others in the federal government to relay our state’s concerns.”“An abrupt reduction in federal funding would not only disrupt care for those who rely on Medicaid, but would also destabilize public and private healthcare providers, leading to workforce reductions, service limitations, and financial strain on already overburdened health care facilities,” Lombardo wrote.National Governors Association Chair Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat, and Vice Chair Kevin Stitt, an Oklahoma Republican, wrote in a joint statement released in March that the organization is “committed to advocating for a robust and efficient health and human services system, including Medicaid.”“Without consultation and proper planning, Congressionally proposed reductions to Medicaid would impact state budgets, rural hospitals and health care service providers,” they wrote. “It is necessary for Governors to have a seat at the table when discussing any reforms and cuts to Medicaid funding.”Federal spending cuts to Medicaid could lead some of the 40 states that have expanded the program under Obamacare to roll it back, though Missouri, Oklahoma and South Dakota have the expansion in their constitutions, making the impact of congressional action more complicated for their budgets and residents.Leighton Ku, professor of health policy and management at The George Washington University, said during an interview that even though GOP governors aren’t members of Congress, they still hold “powerful influence.”“We're talking about deep cuts in federal spending that will have profound effects on state economies and state employment,” Ku said. “Governors, particularly those who expanded Medicaid, should feel fairly nervous about: What are the implications for their states in terms of both their political futures as well as what it will do to their state economies?”“Again, we're talking about the possibility of maybe somewhere on the order of a million jobs being lost simply because of the Medicaid cuts,” he added. “And that should cause some trepidation among governors.”Republicans in Congress, Ku said, are trying to reduce spending. But when it comes to Medicaid, where the cost of administering the program is split between states and the federal government, any change to the federal share will come at the expense of the states.“So the states end up being losers,” he said. “And this will cause states’ governors some unease. Again, it depends on where they lie politically: They may still be willing to accept cuts if it fits in with their ideologies.”State and local taxesRepublicans also find themselves in a sticky situation when it comes to a major tax provision set to expire at the end of 2025: a limit on the amount of state and local taxes a taxpayer can deduct on their federal tax return. The limit is often simply referred to as the SALT cap.Like proposed Medicaid cuts, the SALT debate has potential to change the calculus of Republicans willing to vote for the one large reconciliation bill.For many years prior to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, taxpayers were able to take full advantage of deducting state and local taxes from their federal taxable income. But in that law, GOP lawmakers changed course and enacted a $10,000 cap on the SALT deduction to raise revenue to cover some of the law’s massive tax breaks.The ability to deduct all eligible state and local taxes on federal tax returns was a win for wealthy households located in states and municipalities with steeper taxes.At the time, Democrats, who wholesale opposed Trump’s tax agenda, saw the SALT cap as an attack on high-earning, high-tax blue states. But the SALT cap drew ire from across the aisle as well, said Kyle Pomerleau, senior fellow and federal tax policy expert for the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.“The original bill also had a few Republicans that didn't vote for it because of the cap. So this has been controversial to some degree from the very beginning,” Pomerleau said.With such a narrow majority in the House, Republicans from high-tax areas, including those representing New York’s Long Island and Staten Island and California’s wealthy suburbs, will have leverage in the coming debate.“Republicans generally don't come from those states. There's only a handful of them. But that brings us back to the vote margin that Republicans have,” Pomerleau said. “They have a lot of power this time around to really get what they want. These lawmakers who represent people that are concerned about this cap are going to want that cap raised.”The issue is one of the few tax topics not polarized by party because it is defined by location, said Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a think tank that generally supports lower taxes.“It's an interesting sort of debate, just because a lot of tax policy debates have political, partisan, ideological components, right? That’s somewhat predictable,” Watson said. “What's interesting about SALT is actually it’s also a strong geographic story.”Watson published the Tax Foundation’s 2023 county-by-county maps of state and local taxes paid as well as deducted from federal taxes in 2020. The data showed the top reporting counties were concentrated in California and New York.Raising cap would cost federal governmentBut many Republicans would be happy if the cap on SALT deductions stayed in place to offset the cost of extending the 2017 tax cuts.Raising the cap beyond the current $10,000 limit could reduce federal revenue between $200 billion to $1.2 trillion over the next decade, depending on what level Congress decides, according to a January analysis from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank that leans center-left.In other words, households deducting more from their federal taxable income means the federal government reaping less revenue.“Just to give you some order of magnitude, we looked at what would happen if you raised the cap from $10,000 to $20,000. That would cost (the federal government) $250 billion over 10 years. That's a big number,” said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.Deficit hawks, like Roy of Texas and Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, have spoken out in recent months against raising the cap.And while more federal revenue is lost with each dollar the cap increases, the benefit mainly goes to high-income earners, according to another Tax Policy Center analysis.“We estimated when you raise the (SALT cap) from $10,000 to $20,000, 93% of the benefit goes to the top …20% , which are people making more than $200,000,” Gleckman said. “And half of it goes to people in the top 5% who are people who make more than $400,000.”Most taxpayers take the standard deduction, which in 2025 sits at $15,000 for single taxpayers or $30,000 for married taxpayers filing jointly.“That's why the vast majority of people get no benefit from this. It's only people who make a lot of money, who itemize, and who pay a lot of tax who get caught up in the cap,” Gleckman said.But they may have an outsized voice as Congress hammers out its reconciliation bill in the coming months.Johnson, a Louisiana Republican whose constituents would not benefit from raising the SALT cap, will have a “tough balancing act,” Gleckman said.“Mike Johnson looks at the narrow majority he has in the House, and he sees if he loses half a dozen seats from places like New York and California because he doesn't fix the cap then he could not be speaker anymore,” he said.Republicans in the bipartisan SALT caucus include Reps. Mike Lawler, Nick LaLota, Andrew Garbarino and Nicole Malliotakis, all representing New York, as well as Tom Kean Jr. of New Jersey, and Young Kim of California.Rachel Snyderman, managing director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said “complicated political tetris” is likely to emerge as lawmakers negotiate the reconciliation bill.“The caucus that has called for (the cap’s) elimination over the past years has only gotten louder and more vocal and see this year as the opportunity to flex their muscle,” Snyderman said.",,,,2025-04-24 13:14:46.303503

(Photo by Wes Muller/LA Illuminator, Saturday Aug. 29, 2020.)Louisiana lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday that would prohibit roofing contractors from assisting homeowners with insurance claims. It would also stop insurance adjusters from performing construction work in connection with the claims they handle. 
House Bill 121, sponsored by Rep. Roy Daryl Adams, D-Jackson, unanimously cleared the House Committee on Insurance and goes next to the floor for consideration. The proposal is one of dozens that lawmakers have filed, with the backing of insurance companies, in an effort to try to lower coverage premiums in the state.
The bill intends to prevent conflicts of interest with adjusters who are also residential contractors. It would also prohibit roofing contractors from providing, advertising or soliciting insurance claims handling services for their customers. Roofers would further have to end the use of contingency contracts in which they agree to perform work only if the homeowner’s insurance company approves the cost. 
Adams said he hopes his measure will stop contractors from going door to door after a storm to talk homeowners into filing insurance claims for roof work.
Several committee members praised the bill and asked Adams to amend it so that it applies to all types of construction contractors and subcontractors. However, several roofers testified in opposition to the proposal.  
Josh Lovell, a sales manager with Gator Roofing in Baton Rouge, said the bill would essentially make it illegal for him to help customers with a task they often want help with. Insurance companies will sometimes deny claims and leave homeowners unaware that they can challenge the denial or ask for a second opinion, which contractors can provide, he said. 
“If we can’t even talk about any of the process, then you’re just giving all the power to the insurance company,” Lovell said. “And do you trust insurance companies like that?”
Johnathan Davis, a board member with the Residential Roofing Association of Louisiana, said contingency agreements and working with insurance companies are a vital part of his profession.

“I know there are good and bad companies just like every industry,” Davis said. “I think that this would hurt everybody — not just the bad actors.”
Committee Chairman Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, who works as an insurance consultant, said it’s wrong for contractors to assist homeowners with insurance claims because it’s not within their area of expertise. 
“That is outside of what you’re licensed to do,” Firment said. “There’s other avenues for the homeowner to take if there’s a dispute.”
There is a “big problem” with shady contractors in the roofing industry who find damage where none actually exists, Firment added. 
“I think we’ve got to get back to roofers being tradesmen and not salesmen,” he said.
Rep. Chance Henry, R-Crowley, who owns an insurance agency, echoed Firment’s statements, pointing out that homeowners can hire public adjusters to handle any disputes that might arise. Public adjusters are independent claims assessors whom policyholders can hire to represent their interests as opposed to adjusters who work on behalf of insurance companies. They typically charge homeowners a fee of around 15% of the final settled claim amount. 
Davis with the roofers’ association challenged the lawmakers’ stance, saying adjusters are experts in interpreting insurance policies but are not generally the most knowledgeable on roof construction and damage assessments. Many homeowners are hesitant to hire a public adjuster because it can be costly, usually escalates the claim and adds another layer to the process, he said. 
The bill’s provisions are so ambiguous, according to Davis, they could make it illegal for roofers just to send damage estimates to an insurance adjuster. 
“I don’t want to be in court one day defending sending an … estimate to an adjuster,” he said.
Lovell said he would be afraid to even say the word “insurance” in the presence of a customer if the bill becomes law. 
Hearing their concerns, Firment said the bill might need to be amended to better define some provisions so roofers aren’t blocked from offering some of their routine services.

The announcement, planned for Monday, comes two months after President Donald Trump’s administration removed Adair Ford Boroughs as the state’s lead federal prosecutor, a role she had filled since July 2022. Boroughs’ assistant attorney Brook Andrews has been acting U.S. attorney since.
SC’s U.S. attorney removed by Trump administration

Stirling will begin as interim attorney Monday. The Trump administration is expected to officially nominate him as U.S. attorney after that, sources said.
Stirling, 55, has overseen the state’s 21 prisons since 2013, when then-Gov. Nikki Haley nominated him to the position. The Department of Corrections has more than 3,700 employees responsible for caring for more than 16,000 inmates.
As prisons director, Stirling has cracked down on contraband coming into prisons, including pushing for a change in federal law to make inmates’ illicit cellphones useless. He successfully asked legislators to raise pay for corrections officers in an effort to recruit and retain them. And he oversaw a number of programs meant to keep inmates from returning to prison after release.
Stirling also led the department through a 2018 prison riot that left seven inmates dead and the restarting of executions after 13 years, including the first conducted by firing squad in state history.
As interim U.S. attorney, Stirling would be in charge of 140 employees responsible for criminal prosecutions and civil lawsuits across the state.
Stirling’s name was among those floated for the position during Trump’s first term.
Trump eventually nominated Columbia attorney Sherri Lydon, who was in the position for less than two years. Her successor, Peter McCoy, was confirmed in June 2020 and stepped down eight months later at the request of the Biden administration.
Stirling has a long background in South Carolina government.
Before becoming director of the state’s prison system, Stirling was Haley’s chief of staff.
Prior to that, he was deputy attorney general during Gov. Henry McMaster’s two terms as attorney general.
A Boston native, Stirling received both his bachelor’s degree (1991) and his law degree (1996) from the University of South Carolina. He spent a decade working for private firms before becoming a public prosecutor.
Soon after Boroughs’ exit was announced, McMaster told reporters he thought Stirling would be a good choice to lead the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
“He really is an extraordinary man,” McMaster said at the time. “He would be excellent in any office.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_7225-scaled-e1702068651380-1024x780.jpeg,,,2025-04-24 13:14:46.303503

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)The latest attempt to add an Equal Rights Amendment to the Maine Constitution has all but failed, though a procedural move on Thursday technically leaves it in limbo until appropriations are settled at the end of session. 
Constitutional amendments are ultimately decided by the voters but first need to receive the support of two-thirds of the Maine Legislature. On Wednesday, the House voted 74-65 to enact the measure, failing to meet that threshold. 
The reason Republicans were opposed: gender identity. 
“The question before us is not whether equality matters,” Rep. Jennifer Poirier (R-Skowhegan) said on the House floor on April 17. “It’s whether this amendment helps or harms that cause, and I submit that it does more harm than good.”
The proposed amendment would prohibit “the denial or abridgment by the state or any political subdivision of the state of equal rights based on the actual or perceived race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, physical or mental disability, ancestry or national origin of an individual.”
Echoing prominent opposition to the federal Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s, several of the Republicans who voted against the measure claimed it was a threat to women’s rights because of the protections it would afford against discrimination based on gender identity, which is a protected class under the Maine Human Rights Act. 
Gender identity has become a major flashpoint in Maine since President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless the state complies with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing in girls’ sports. 
The state is currently being sued by the Department of Justice and has been the subject of several probes and funding cuts that have been widely interpreted as retaliatory. The Legislature is also considering a few individual bills to restrict transgender students’ access to sports, bathrooms and locker rooms.
Despite this new context, state efforts to pass an ERA are longstanding. 
LD 260, proposed by Rep. Holly Sargent (D-York) and more than 90 Democratic and independent co-sponsors, continues the work of the late state Rep. Lois Galgay Reckitt, who pressed for a state ERA for five decades, with the last attempt failing to pass in 2023 during her final term in the Maine Legislature.
On the House floor on April 17, Sargent argued constitutions are not static documents. 
“Our Constitution began with a narrow vision of to whom equal rights were given,” Sargent said. “But our national and state constitutions are living evolving and expanding pronouncements of what Americans believe throughout our history. Our constitutions have gradually redefined who is worthy of all of the rights to be bestowed and who can be excluded, who is viewed as less than human.”
Lawmakers are not considering with this bill whether to enshrine rights in the Constitution, said Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor), but rather whether to let the voters decide. 
“I, for one, am not afraid of the will of the people,” Roeder said, “and I hope the rest of this body will join me in that.”
The Democratic majority in the lower chamber did. But instead of casting an enactment vote on Thursday, the Senate sent the legislation to the “Appropriations Table.” This is typical for constitutional amendments, as they will have fiscal notes associated with election costs. 
If bills aren’t explicitly funded in the state budget, they need to be paid for using remaining unappropriated money, which is divided up usually near the end of session when the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee “runs the table.” 
While bills placed on the table can still pass, precedent shows that most will die, left on the table without final action by the time the Legislature adjourns. Regardless, initial votes in both chambers and the enactment vote in the House signal the two-thirds threshold will not be reached even if appropriators do eventually decide to take it off the table.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner)Chris Marshall took care to cast a ballot last fall while in France tending to his business, and was surprised to find months after the 2024 election that Judge Jefferson Griffin wanted his vote thrown out. 
Griffin challenged Marshall and thousands of other military and overseas absentee voters who did not provide photo ID with their ballots. The State Board of Elections did not require it. Most military and civilian overseas voters cast ballots using a special portal that does not provide a way to include a photo. 
Griffin worked to have their votes in the Supreme Court race tossed, but the state Supreme Court said they should have a chance to submit IDs.  
Now back home in Durham, Marshall and his wife Moira Smullen tried to address the problem by checking to see if they could submit photos using the same electronic portal they used to vote. They couldn’t.
“Right now, it’s just wait and see what happens,” he said. 
Phoebe Zerwick, director of the Journalism Program at Wake Forest University, was teaching in Venice when she voted last year. She researched ways to vote before she left North Carolina. She cast her ballot electronically, relieved that she didn’t have to depend on the Italian postal system. She didn’t know her vote was being challenged until after Christmas.
Marshall, Zerwick and other voters — it’s still unclear how many — are trapped in electoral limbo. They’re waiting on the sidelines while court fights with more twists and hairpin turns than a rollercoaster run through state and federal courts. 
The outcome will determine whether they or any of the military and overseas voters whom Griffin is challenging will have to provide a photo ID in order for their votes to count in the Supreme Court race. 
It’s been a long ride. 
Where things stand
Nearly six months after the election, major questions remain unanswered. It’s not certain that overseas voters will have to provide photo ID. 
Griffin, a Republican Court of Appeals judge, is trying to unseat Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs for a place on the state’s high court. He trails by 734 votes and tried to convince state courts to throw out more than 60,000 votes in his attempt to win.

The state Supreme Court decided earlier this month that the biggest stack of votes Griffin challenged for what he said were incomplete voter registrations should be counted. But the court majority said overseas and military voters should have provided photo ID last fall, even though the state Board of Elections said they didn’t need to. 
The North Carolina law covering military and overseas absentee voters is patterned on a federal law that exempts them from photo ID requirements. But the Supreme Court majority agreed with Griffin that the state voter ID law applies to all.  
Those voters would have 30 days from the point the elections board sends them notices to provide ID or submit a form stating why they cannot, the court ordered. 
The court majority also decided that a few hundred voters whom Griffin classified as “never residents” should not have their votes counted in the race. These voters were described as people who have never lived in the state but are connected to North Carolina through their parents.

However, a reporter writing for The Assembly found that some of the voters on Griffin’s “never residents” list live in North Carolina.
Immediately after the April 11 state Supreme Court decision, Riggs appealed in federal court. Federal District Court Judge Richard Myers II told the state Board of Elections to prepare to follow the state order, but this Tuesday a Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals panel approved Riggs’ request for a stay and told the board to stop what it was doing, at least temporarily. 
The Board of Elections last week told Myers it would instruct only Guilford County to contact its 1,409 military and overseas voters about providing a photo ID. The only Griffin protest of overseas and military absentee voters submitted by the legal deadline concerned Guilford, a lawyer for the board wrote. 
The board is working with a vendor to adapt the electronic portal to accept IDs, its lawyer told the judge. 
The 260 “never residents” registered in 53 counties in Griffin’s protests would get the chance to prove that they had lived there, the board’s lawyer told the judge. 
Griffin doesn’t like the board’s plan. He wants military and overseas voters from six counties — Durham, Forsyth, New Hanover, Cumberland, and Buncombe, along with Guilford — to be required to provide ID and asked the state Court of Appeals to make the state Board do it. In a court filing, Griffin’s lawyers said the protests were filed on time, even though they didn’t have voter names. Griffin also objected to the state board giving “never residents” a chance to prove that they lived in the state because the court did not say those voters could “cure” their ballots. Griffin wants “never resident” votes from all 100 counties deleted.
No official notice to individual voters yet
While the court fight occupies both state and federal courts, the State Board of Elections told county elections officials to sit tight. Local administrators were told not to contact overseas or military voters about IDs because the litigation is ongoing. The board does, however, have information for voters on its website.

Voters may choose to submit copies of their IDs or ID exception forms to their county board offices. Counties were instructed to store them in a secure place.
The state Democratic Party is not waiting. It plans to start calling voters on Friday, according to an email to supporters and posts on X.
Zerwick is considering a trip to her county elections board with her husband, whose vote is also being challenged, to show their IDs. 
“I’m uneasy waiting for whatever the process is going to be,” she said. “I’d like to get that over and done with.”
Zerwick has been following the lawsuits and appeals, but she’s worried about Wake Forest students and students from other universities who voted while they were studying abroad.
Most of the counties where Griffin is challenging overseas and military absentee voters are home to major universities. In a few weeks, most students will be leaving school for the summer. 
“Students don’t check email over the summer to receive instructions,” Zerwick said. 
Duke University students studying abroad last fall had detailed instructions on how to vote. Nevertheless, 264 Duke students face challenges for not showing ID.
Olivia Schramkowski, a Duke University junior, created a voting guide for Duke students studying abroad last year as part of her work with the Student Voting Rights Lab at Duke and NC Central University. The state Board of Elections told her, through an email to university administration, that they did not need photo ID. 
Schramkowski herself voted last year while studying abroad. She heard about the Griffin challenges, but a search for her name on his original challenge list came up blank. “I thought I was good to go,” she said. 
Later, she Googled her name as part of a class assignment. It popped up in a Wake County court case she knew nothing about. She clicked on a list of challenged voters and found her name. 
Schramkowski spoke to someone on Wednesday who didn’t know their vote was being challenged. She too worries about students leaving campus without knowing their votes may be in jeopardy. 
Although she’s heard that third parties are trying to track down students, “there are massive gaps in communication,” she said. “There’s a big concern on my part that students’ votes won’t count if we won’t be in the state over the summer.”
A voter assistance hotline (888-687-8683) is already getting calls and texts from folks with questions about where Griffin’s challenges stand and what they can do to make sure their votes count.
Katelin Kaiser, policy director at Democracy North Carolina, said parents whose children are overseas have been calling for advice on how to protect their children’s votes. 
People need help navigating “this really complicated — unfairly complicated — situation,” she said. 
Marshall will be traveling back and forth to Europe this year, all the while waiting for instructions.  
“It’s important that our vote counts,” he said.
“It’s fascinating and interesting and scary all at the same time, these games that they’re playing,” Marshall said. “It’s really shocking and just blatantly disregarding the law.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4267-1024x502.jpg,,,2025-04-24 13:14:46.303503

State officials gathered at the East Camden Bypass this week to highlight the importance of driver safety during National Work Zone Awareness Week, an annual campaign aimed at reducing crashes and fatalities in highway work zones.
Secretary of Transportation Shanté Hastings, joined by Representative Lyndon Yearick, Delaware State Police Lieutenants India Sturgis and Mark Dawson, and DelDOT workers, emphasized the risks road crews face daily and called on drivers to slow down and stay alert.
“Over the past three years, 65 DelDOT employees have been injured in work zone crashes and of those 65, 13 were seriously injured,” Hastings said. “When you see the signs, when you see the flashing lights, when you see the barrels and cones, slow down, eliminate distractions, stay alert, and be extra cautious. By doing these things, motorists can help reduce work zone crashes on our roadways. Please keep our employees safe so they can go home to their families, too,” continued Secretary Hastings.

This year’s campaign theme, “Respect the zone, so we all get home,” underscores the life-and-death stakes of inattentive driving in work zones.
Though highway workers are especially vulnerable, data shows that drivers and their passengers account for about 80% of work zone crash fatalities.
According to national statistics, an average of one highway worker and seven motorists are killed each week in the U.S. due to work zone crashes.
Speeding, tailgating, and distracted driving are among the most common causes.
Officials also reminded the public of simple safety tips, such as obeying signage, avoiding lane changes, maintaining a safe following distance, and reducing speed—especially when approaching toll booths or active construction zones.
First observed in 1999, National Work Zone Awareness Week is a collaborative effort between the Federal Highway Administration, American Traffic Safety Services Association, and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. Since its inception, the initiative has grown to include state agencies and advocacy groups nationwide.

Michael Bennet of Colorado speaks during a town hall at Colorado Mesa University’s Asteria Theater in Grand Junction on Wednesday. (Sharon Sullivan for Colorado Newsline)U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado held a town hall meeting Wednesday in Grand Junction, where he fielded questions regarding education, potential changes in voter registration, the wrongful deportation and imprisonment of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, and what Democrats in power are doing to rein in President Donald Trump. 
Approximately 850 people registered for the event, according to Bennet’s deputy communications director Eric Jones. The event took place at Colorado Mesa University’s Asteria Theater.
Earlier this month the Democratic senator declared his candidacy for Colorado governor — which means there will be a primary race between Bennet and another prominent Democrat, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, for the party’s nomination. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, who has served as governor since 2019, is term-limited. Weiser announced his candidacy in January and is currently serving his second term as attorney general.

Though personable and humorous at times, Bennet did not give direct answers to many of the audience questions, which were selected via “raffle tickets” offered to attendees as they entered the theater. 
One woman expressed concern about funding for public schools — which is a top issue for Bennet, the former superintendent of Denver Public Schools. He circled back to the topic of education several times during the one-hour town hall. Bennet said there needs to be a serious conversation about improving teacher salaries, how the state Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights operates, and funding for both K-12 education and health care in the state.
“I think (education) is the most important issue we are facing,” he said. 
Another woman told Bennet how she was “petrified” that the SAVE Act could take away a women’s right to vote. The U.S. House of Representatives this month passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, which would require proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections. Opponents of the bill say it would make it difficult to vote for women who have changed their name after marriage. 
Women won the right to vote in 1920, with the ratification of the 19th Amendment. The women fighting for that right never gave up, Bennet said.
“We have to keep (the suffrage movement) in our minds and be inspired by it,” Bennet said.

Another person asked if the money spent on housing prisoners in El Salvador was approved by Congress, to which Bennet responded, “No, to my knowledge Congress has not authorized money.” The Trump administration is paying El Salvador to incarcerate prisoners like Abrego Garcia and Trump has suggested “homegrown” American citizens could be sent there, too.
One man, who addressed the senator as “Governor Bennet” — eliciting a smattering of cheers and applause — asked Bennet why he is running for governor. 
“Like everybody else I am searching my conscience … and thinking about where I can make the biggest difference,” Bennet said.
Bennet was also asked why Democrats have not been able to fight the Trump agenda. 
Bennet responded that while there are many things he blames Trump for, getting elected is not one of them. He said he is frustrated with the Democratic Party for not articulating a compelling vision of what it stands for. Democrats failed to build a coalition that could win in November, he said. Plus, Trump tapped into Americans’ frustration regarding the economy.
Rose Ericson, of Grand Junction, is a Republican who attended the town hall on Wednesday. She told Newsline that she was there because many people feel the Democrats are not doing enough to hold Trump accountable and that the U.S. Congress has the “purse strings” and has given away its control. Ericson did not vote for Trump in 2016 or 2020.
“They’ve thrown away the checks and balances that were built into the Constitution, and it’s appalling,” she said.
Some in the audience mentioned fears about Social Security, including the possible closure of the agency’s offices and loss of the ability to communicate with a live person. Bennet said he’s all for reforming the government, but sending Elon Musk and his young staff to do it is probably not a good idea. Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency has interfered with government agencies including the Social Security Administration, threatening its operations through cuts to the workforce and offices across the country.
Another person, who works in the trucking industry and is often at truck stops, asked Bennet how to combat what he characterized as lies put out by Fox News, to which Bennet responded that dealing with propaganda is a “big worry” — and not just from domestic sources, but also from China and Russia. 
Another woman told Bennet the “authoritarian” Trump administration is a “nightmare” and asked why Democrats aren’t doing more to stop the president. She also wanted to know what Bennet and other Democrats are doing to bring Abrego Garcia back from El Salvador. The Trump administration has admitted it made an administrative error when it deported Abrego Garcia, but thus far it has ignored a court order to facilitate his return.
Bennet agreed Abrego Garcia should be returned to the United States. He said he personally doesn’t have the power to bring him back home but that Trump should obey the court ruling. 
Bennet told attendees to resist, to push back against threats to democracy, which prompted one person to respond that people can only push back so much and that “we need to know how you Dems are pushing back. What is going on?”
Bennet replied, “First of all, any ideas you have I’ll take. But we have pushed back. Can I do a better job? I’m sure of that. We all bear a responsibility.”
As Bennet was leaving the stage, shaking hands, greeting constituents, a reporter asked why he voted to confirm Doug Burgum as secretary of Interior. 
Burgum issued an order last week that overhauls the organization of the Interior Department, turning over decision-making authority to a DOGE staff member.
Bennet said he voted for Burgum, former governor of North Dakota, because he was a successful Western governor and businessman.
“We had a conversation about public lands in Colorado. I thought it was important to have with a few of these nominees a connection with Colorado. There’s a handful I voted for because I think in the long term they’ll be good for Colorado,” Bennet said.
Both U.S. senators from Colorado — Bennet and Democrat John Hickenlooper — have disappointed some progressives for their votes in favor of confirming some of Trump’s Cabinet nominees. 
Colorado Newsline reached out to Weiser for comment regarding his own bid for governor of Colorado. 
“For the past eight years, I’ve spent every day fighting for Coloradans and our way of life,” Weiser said in an email to Newline. “Senator Bennet has been in Washington on the front lines, which is where we need him to be, especially now. But I continue to be alarmed at Trump’s cabinet choices — including those whom Bennet voted for. Doug Burgum, for instance, has said out loud his plans to sell off our public lands to the highest bidder. Now is not the time for ‘picking our battles’ when it comes to Trump’s all-out assault on our country and our Constitution.”

(Lexi Browning | West Virginia Watch)A judge has issued a temporary restraining order allowing a Marshall University graduate student to stay in the country after the Trump administration said it was canceling his student visa. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia filed the lawsuit against administration officials on behalf of S.V., who is a citizen of India. S.V. was weeks away from graduating with a data science degree when he got word that the Trump administration was revoking his student visa. He later learned that he was “identified in a criminal records check,” an ACLU news release said.
More than 1,000 international students at 160 colleges and universities across the country have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since March, according to a report by the Associated Press.  That includes students at colleges and universities in West Virginia. 
S.V. was sentenced to probation in 2020 in Indiana for operating a vehicle under the influence, a misdemeanor, according to the ACLU. He left the United States and returned in 2023 to study at Marshall. The ACLU argues that having been identified in a criminal record check is not legal ground for terminating a visa.  
In the order Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Robert Chambers ordered the Trump administration to restore S.V.’s F-1 student visa status and prohibit officials from arresting, detaining or transferring him out of the court’s jurisdiction. 
“ACLU-WV won’t stop fighting until his status is permanently restored,” the organization said in a statement. 
The judge has set a hearing in the case for 10 a.m. May 7 at the federal court house in Huntington.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)A majority of Americans fear a constitutional crisis is developing from the ongoing conflicts between the Trump Administration and the courts, according to a national survey released Thursday by the Elon University Poll. 
Since the beginning of his second term, Trump has worked to concentrate power, signing 130 executive orders so far. Critics are challenging some of those orders as unconstitutional.
The policy journal Just Security had documented 206 legal challenges against Trump administration actions as of April 22, the Elon press release noted. 
Forty-six percent of Elon poll respondents said the president has too much power compared to the other branches of government, while 38% said he has the right amount, and 5% said he had too little. 
There’s a partisan split in the responses, with 79% of Democrats saying the president had too much power, and 67% of Republicans saying he has the right amount. A slim majority of independents said he has too much power. 
Sixty-seven percent of those surveyed said they were concerned about “a situation in which the executive branch and the courts strongly disagree over their constitutional powers and neither side backs down—creating a crisis over who has the final say.”
A majority, 54%, said the executive branch should not have the authority to ignore or override court rulings. The partisan breakdown on that question was 78% of Democrats, 53% of independents, and 33% of Republicans saying the executive branch should not have the authority to ignore the courts. 
The poll found Trump’s approval rating slipping, with 41% approving of the job he’s doing and 47% disapproving. That compares with a 45% approval to 41% disapproval rating from the February poll.

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)People needing assistance in Spanish from the Florida Department of Children and Families wait on hold for nearly an hour, according to a report from the Hispanic civil rights group UnidosUS.
The wait time for the call center, which fields questions about government cash and food assistance programs and Medicaid, has improved since the group started monitoring its efficacy in the summer of 2023.
Still, UnidosUS found that Spanish speakers deal with an average wait time of 54 minutes, whereas the wait averages 13 minutes for English speakers.

Thursday’s report is the third the group has published about the wait times, starting as the state began disenrolling millions from Medicaid following the end of the federal COVID-19 public health emergency.
While the wait time for Spanish speakers has gone down from 120 minutes in 2023 to 56 minutes, 45% of the calls the group made got dropped before reaching a live agent. Between September and February, UnidosUS made 174 calls to the English and Spanish lines at various times of the day.
By comparison, only 5% of the calls seeking assistance in English were disconnected, according to the report. The wait time for English speakers went down from 34 minutes in 2023 to 13 minutes between September and February.
DCF’s call center wait times have drawn scrutiny, with Floridians facing the second-longest wait time in the country last year. Concerns from lawmakers led to an investment of $12 million into improving the call center at the time.
Jared Nordlund, UnidosUS’ Florida director, said the group is advocating for DCF to hire more bilingual call center agents.
“Clearly, the money we advocated for last session to beef up call centers worked,” Nordlund said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix. “This has worked really well for English speakers, so clearly there needs to be more work done to help Spanish speakers.”
Additionally, testimony during a federal trial in Jacksonville last year revealed the department had blocked 54% of phone calls from people wanting to reach one of its call center agents that April.
Inefficiencies within the call center played a key role in the class action filed by Medicaid patients alleging Florida violated their constitutional right to due process when it took away their health care coverage without proper notice. Plaintiffs argued during the trial that call center agents gave them wrong information about their Medicaid eligibility.
At the time, the director of the call center testified that DCF planned to hire hundreds more people to handle the calls.

Five international students, all connected to Missouri campuses, have sued the Trump administration over their terminated student record, which could threaten their ability to legally remain in the United States (Vaughn Wheat/The Beacon).Five international college students in Missouri have filed a federal lawsuit challenging the termination of their student registrations by the Department of Homeland Security — a revocation that essentially threatens their ability to legally remain in the United States.
The students believe that prior nonviolent incidents might have triggered DHS to revoke their records in a government database that tracks international students.
An international student in Missouri from Nigeria, for example, had once paid a $50 fine for playing music too loudly.
Another student, also from Nigeria, had once been cited for improperly passing a streetcar and paid a $80.50 fine.
And yet another, from Bangladesh, had been charged with public intoxication but believed that the issue was resolved years ago after he completed six months of probation and 75 hours of community service.
The complaint was filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri by Kansas City immigration attorney Rekha Sharma-Crawford, who is representing the students.
A hearing April 24 will determine if a request for a temporary restraining order will be granted, said Sharma-Crawford.
The complaint joins a flurry of similar challenges nationwide.
According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, there are more than 1 million international students in the U.S.
The American Immigration Lawyers Association has noted that more than 4,700 international students had records that were canceled, according to reporting by Science.
In a separate case brought in Atlanta, a graduate student from Bangladesh studying at Missouri State University was among 133 international students who had their status restored this week after a temporary restraining order was approved.
The students represented in the local lawsuit involve a range of universities and nationalities.

A Nigerian student studying computer science at Truman State University.
A Spanish student at Northwest Missouri State University on a tennis scholarship.
A Nepal graduate student studying at Southeast Missouri State University.
A mechanical engineering graduate from Bangladesh who was employed at a Kansas City company as part of his practical training.
And a Nigerian graduate of the Missouri University of Science and Technology who was employed at a Columbia, Missouri, bank as part of her practical training.

The terminations came “without notice and without cause,” the Missouri suit alleges, and caused immediate and irreparable harm.
“In essence, they took students lawfully here on their student visas and stripped them of their legal status,” the complaint reads. “They did this to create chaos and uncertainty and cause some students to abandon their studies and leave the United States.”
Sharma-Crawford said about 40 such cases have been filed nationwide, challenging the government’s actions targeting international students.
The Missouri complaint is against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security and Todd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
In early April, thousands of foreign college students began discovering that the Trump administration had terminated their student records, which are tracked within DHS by the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS.
 Fear of retaliation among international students

The five Missouri students are anonymous in the lawsuit, citing fear of retaliation or harassment and blacklisting by third parties.
The complaint alleges that the students have lost jobs, health care and their student status and suffered stress from not being able to pay for their rent or basic needs, in addition to upending their career goals.
Homeland Security has not initiated removal proceedings, colloquially referred to as deportation, against any of the students, said Sharma-Crawford.
The lawsuit alleges that DHS terminated the students’ registrations without sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard, a violation of their Fifth Amendment right to due process.
Several of the students had previously left the U.S. and reentered without any issues with U.S. Customs and Border Protection after the minor criminal incidents.
In response to similar court challenges, the government has taken what some see as a contradictory stance, emphasizing that it has merely terminated a record in a government tracking database, nothing more.
And yet, some students have then been advised by emails that they must leave the U.S.
For universities, some do not want to risk their own funding by being accused of harboring an immigrant not legally able to study or reside in the U.S.
Requests for comment from several Missouri university offices that oversee international students were not returned.
There is no publicly accessible database to track the status of international students.
But Inside Higher Ed and The Chronicle of Higher Education have been compiling listings, reporting that at least 1,500 students have been affected as of April 21.
The sites note that Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville had 716 international students last fall and 43 recent revocations.
Other regional campuses listed include: Webster University, with 24 students affected; Missouri State University, with six students affected; and Park University, with at least one student affected.
The Missouri complaint also notes that the students’ schools also were not given a rationale for the decisions.
The five students listed in the lawsuit learned of the terminations from their universities, according to the complaint. School officials received emails advising that ICE had terminated the student’s SEVIS registration.
The complaint also details the process that international students use during their studies:
“Foreign students who wish to study in the United States apply to schools which are part of the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (“SEVP”). This program is monitored within the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”). ICE, through SEVP, uses the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems (“SEVIS”), a government database that tracks international students’ compliance with their student visa status. Student visas are commonly referred to as F-1 visas.”
The complaint alleges: “Yet, each Plaintiff, once terminated in the SEVIS system, even wrongfully, would be left without status and their presence becomes immediately unauthorized. Any work authorization for on and/or off campus is immediately terminated, they are unable to re-enter the U.S. on a terminated SEVIS record and they become subject to arrest, detention and deportation.”
 Court challenges joined by university pushback

U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Kansas Democrat, believes that bipartisan leverage might be possible to address unfair targeting of international students.
Davids said some Republicans in the House could be engaged on the issue.
“This is one of those areas where every single state — red states, blue states, it doesn’t matter — they benefit from having robust universities,” Davids said during a town hall hosted by KCUR on April 21.
She added that in some areas with Republican representation the affected universities are “the economic driver of their communities.”
Universities nationwide have been under intense scrutiny by the Trump administration.
Some have seen grants canceled, often involving research, with the allegation that an institution hadn’t done enough to protect Jewish students from antisemitism that allegedly occurred during student protests against Palestinian deaths in Gaza that were inflicted by the U.S.-backed Israeli military.
Critics allege that President Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to deport millions of undocumented immigrants now appears to include gathering up those legally present, or maneuvering to alter their status and encourage self-deportation, without due process.
The American Association of Colleges and Universities released “A call for constructive engagement” on April 22, signed by more than 100 college and university presidents, including President Fred P. Pestello of Saint Louis University.
The lengthy statement sought to “speak with one voice against the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education.”
“Our colleges and universities share a commitment to serve as centers of open inquiry where, in pursuit of truth, faculty, students, and staff are free to exchange ideas and opinions across a full range of viewpoints without fear of retribution, censorship, or deportation.”

In its original state, Senate Bill 2 by Sen. Mike Fesi, R-Houma, would have prohibited public water systems from fluoridating their water, which is done to prevent tooth decay. The practice began in the United States in the 1940s and is widely supported by major dental and medical associations. 
The Senate Health and Welfare Committee amended the bill to allow fluoridation only if voters approve, which would involve what committee chair and bill co-author Sen. Patrick McMath, R-Covington, described as an “incredibly difficult” process. 
The legislation advanced after the committee approved the amendments, which Sen. Gerald Beaudreaux, D-Lafayette, put forward before ultimately voting against the bill. The changes would allow local residents to vote on whether they want their system to be fluoridated, but only after at least 15% of voters the system services petition for the election. 
McMath likened it to the process for recalling an elected official, a very burdensome process that rarely succeeds in Louisiana. 
The bill, which Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham supports, is based on the premise that fluoride is harmful. In high doses, the chemical, like many others, can cause adverse health effects. But at the amount present in American water systems, there is scant evidence fluoride presents a health risk. 
“Too much or too little of anything is bad for you, including vitamins and water,” said Anne Jayes, senior policy manager with the Louisiana Public Health Institute. “Too little [fluoride] can lead to poor dental hygiene, cavities and poor bone health, including osteoporosis.”
At the recommended level of 0.7 milligrams per liter of water, fluoride strengthens teeth and helps prevent decay, especially in communities where access to dental care is limited, Jayes added. 
In places where fluoride has been removed from the water systems, studies have found drastic increases in pediatric dental complications. After Calgary Canada stopped fluoridating its water in 2011, a decision it reversed in 2021, there was a 700% increase in the number of children receiving IV antibiotics at a local hospital for dental infections and abscesses. 
Annette Droddy, executive director of the Louisiana Dental Association, represents nearly 2,000 dentists in Louisiana. She warned the passage of the bill would lead to an increase in state spending for its Medicaid dental program. 
The bill will next be debated by the Senate.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Opponents to two new natural gas plants proposed by Evergy testified Wednesday about uncertain costs of natural gas and pushed the Kansas Corporation Commission to consider other options for expanding power generation in the state.
During the third day of KCC hearings, Nick Jones, a senior analyst at New Energy Economics, told commissioners he had the “dubious distinction” of being the only person in the room to have worked as a natural gas forecaster.
“I’m familiar with some of the pitfalls and some of the risks in trying to forecast natural gas that far in advance,” he said, referring to projected costs that will be incurred for Evergy natural gas plants expected to go into service in 2029 and 2030.
Jones said the U.S. Energy Information Administration has “substantially” revised its forecast for natural gas prices expected in the 2030s in its most recent energy outlook report.
“It’s now significantly above the mid-case (price) that Evergy has proposed in this docket,” he said, referring to low, mid- and high-case projections made by Evergy for natural gas costs.
Supporting his concerns, Jones said, a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City of leading energy producers also predicted increases in natural gas costs in the coming years.
“Now all of these are just data points. I don’t think any of those are definitive, but I do see that the early signals indicate that there is upside risk in the natural gas market, and that the commission should take seriously the potential that these plants could be operating in a scenario closer to the high gas scenario that Evergy modeled, and potentially even beyond that,” Jones said.
 
Natural gas volatility
In written, prefiled testimony, Jones said Evergy failed to account for natural gas price volatility in its supply plan, which showed purchasing natural gas in a manner similar to purchasing coal.
“Natural gas cannot be easily stockpiled on site, as is common practice for coal,” Jones’ written testimony said. “Nor can natural gas be delivered through multiple modes of transport, as can be done for coal. Nor is natural gas marketed almost exclusively to the power sector, as is the case for thermal coal. In contrast to coal markets, natural gas markets rely on centralized storage and delivery to end-users via pipelines.”
Those and other factors Jones listed in testimony mean natural gas is a “just-in-time” fuel for which the timing and volume of deliveries must coincide exactly with the needs of the power plant.
“Therefore, procuring natural gas inherently requires more sophisticated methods and leaves less room for error than procuring coal,” he said during Wednesday’s hearing.
Jones primarily focused on the need for more diversification in Evergy’s portfolio than what the natural gas plants would add, and he questioned whether commissioners should approve the second natural gas plant at this time.
“I’m not, you know, going to sit here and claim that batteries are a one-to-one swap for natural gas or that there’s some kind of panacea,” he said. “All these options have advantages and drawbacks, but one thing that we can say for sure is that the more diversity that there is in Evergy’s expansion plans, the less that they will be exposed to any particular risk, and that includes the risk of high natural gas prices.”
 
Outdated model
The second and final witness Wednesday was Lucy Metz, an associate with Synapse Energy Economics testifying for the Citizens Utility Ratepayer Board. On Tuesday, KCC’s Justin Grady, deputy director of utilities, criticized Metz’s focus on adding battery storage, saying it did not mesh with the Integrated Resource Plan that Every is required to file. The IRP lays out the company’s projections for market needs and how it will meet them.
“Market conditions have changed significantly since Evergy developed that 2024 IRP preferred portfolio, and in particular, the relative cost of different replacement resources has changed significantly,” Metz said Wednesday. “It no longer makes sense under these new and current conditions we face for Evergy to forge ahead with that outdated preferred portfolio, which may no longer represent the most cost effective and the lowest risk option for ratepayers.”
Metz said that Evergy did offer updated modeling for the current docket, addressing some of those concerns, but she still felt it did not adequately address market changes.
“I have a number of concerns with this updated modeling, including that Evergy did not account for the future risk of operational restrictions on the combined cycle units from environmental regulations,” she said.
Metz questioned whether Evergy considered the “full range” of resource options before moving forward with proposals for the natural gas plants. She listed converting more of its coal units to gas, for example, to give the company additional time before adding a large resource addition like the proposed plants.
“I believe that if Evergy had corrected these shortcomings, it’s very likely that the model would no longer have selected that 2030 (combined cycle natural gas plant) and would have gone with some of those other alternatives instead,” she said. “And I really sympathize with staff’s instinct in this time of uncertainty related to political headwinds and tariffs and trade wars to lock in this generation. But I just think that perspective really ignores some other categories of risk that ratepayers will be very exposed to.”
 
Addressing uncertainty
Given the current tariff and generally uncertain environment, Metz said, she believes one of the best ways to protect ratepayers would be to select a portfolio that will “be robust across that uncertainty, no matter how things turn out with the tariffs.”
“So it’s really not clear at this moment what the net effect across all the different energy supply chains will be of these tariffs threats, but if Evergy builds the combined cycle units, it will be locking repairs into these very large assets that will then rely on gas over their entire lifetime, and the tariffs could affect gas prices as well,” she said. “Whereas more modular and incremental resource additions, such as batteries or solar energy, can really adapt as it goes, and while tariffs may affect capital costs of these resources, once they’re built, they will have no fuel costs, and so rate payers will no longer be exposed to that uncertainty.”
The predetermination hearing ended after Metz’s testimony. Commissioner Andrew French said the KCC would reach its decision by July 7.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P1010038-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-24 11:08:50.552837

SPRINGFIELD – Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton is the first Democrat to step into what is expected to be a crowded race to fill Sen. Dick Durbin’s Senate seat.

Stratton launched her campaign Thursday morning in a video just one day after Durbin announced he will not seek reelection for a seat he has held since 1997.

“As Donald Trump and Elon Musk continue their relentless attack on Americans, we need new voices in Washington who will stand firm and fight fiercely to move us forward and protect the values we hold dear,” Stratton said in a statement.

Stratton has quickly risen through the ranks in Illinois politics. After serving one term in the Illinois House, Gov. JB Pritzker tapped her to be his running mate during the 2018 campaign. She took over as lieutenant governor alongside Pritzker in 2019, and the pair were reelected in 2022.

Stratton has notably appeared alongside Pritzker at more events in recent months. In her announcement video, she highlighted the accomplishments of Pritzker’s administration.

“(Republicans) like to talk. We’ve actually gotten things done,” Stratton said.

Pritzker praised Stratton but declined to endorse her, at least for now, during an unrelated news conference Thursday morning.

""She is truly one of the most accomplished people that's ever held the job of lieutenant governor,” Pritzker said. “She's done so much as a partner in governance in the state. As you know, I think very highly of her.”

Stratton, 59, who hails from Chicago’s Bronzeville neighborhood, said her path to become a candidate for U.S. Senate isn’t “typical.” She said she wanted to enter politics after being the primary caregiver for her mother, who battled Alzheimer's disease.

Stratton won an expensive race for the Illinois House in 2016, defeating incumbent Democratic Rep. Ken Dunkin, who sometimes sided with Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner during the state’s two-year budget impasse that began in 2015.

Stratton’s professional background includes working as director of the University of Illinois Chicago’s Center for Public Safety and Justice.

Stratton has followed in Pritzker’s shadow as the governor has received accolades from Democrats for raising the minimum wage to $15, banning assault weapons and shoring up abortion protections after Roe v. Wade was struck down in 2022.

But especially in recent months, Stratton has sought to raise her own profile in state politics. She launched the Level Up federal political action committee in January, giving her a financial mechanism to influence federal campaigns or support her own run for office. The committee had not reported any fundraising as of Thursday.

Durbin, 80, announced Wednesday that he will retire when his term ends in 2027 after 44 years in Congress, including the last two decades as the Democratic whip in the Senate.

Durbin told WBEZ-FM radio in Chicago that “at least a dozen” candidates have expressed interest in his seat.

“We are also fortunate to have a strong Democratic bench ready to serve,” Durbin said. “We need them now more than ever.”

The agency renewed its warning this week about the gush of fraudulent texts that falsely claim people have unpaid tolls and will face penalties if they don’t take immediate action. The scam known as “smishing” — a derivative of SMS, for “short message service,” and “phishing,” where a fraudster pretends to be someone else.
Some of the fake text messages requesting toll payments claim to be from KDOT, but the agency doesn’t request or collect payments via text message, and also doesn’t collect tolls. The Kansas Turnpike Authority has oversight of the turnpike tolls.
KDOT advised not to click any link in the scam texts and said anyone who has made a payment should contact their bank or credit card company immediately.
The agency asked that anyone who received a scam message report it to the Federal Trade Commission or the Internet Crime Complaint Center.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4240673-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-24 13:14:46.303503

Twelve states are suing President Donald Trump and officials in his administration over tariffs that have touched nearly all goods imported into the United States.
The suit, State of Oregon, et al., v. Trump, et al., was filed Wednesday by Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and 11 other Democratic state attorneys general in the Court of International Trade in New York. It names Trump, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its leader, Kristi Noem, and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and its leader, Peter Flores.
The attorneys general — from Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Vermont — are challenging four of Trump’s executive orders that have added a 145% tariff on most imports from China, a 25% tariff on most imports from Canada and Mexico, and a 10% tariff on most all other goods imported to the U.S. The suit also preemptively challenges Trump’s plan to raise tariffs on imports from more than 40 other countries on July 9, according to a news release from the Oregon Attorney General’s Office.
“​​We cannot sit quietly while the president takes actions that are going to cost us jobs, increase the prices that we pay, and harm our economy,” Rayfield told reporters Wednesday at a news conference held at the Oregon Department of Justice in Portland.
Experts estimate tariffs could raise the cost of living for the average family nationwide by more than $3,800 a year, according to a report from the Budget Lab at Yale University.
Rayfield and the other attorneys general argue Trump is unlawfully using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs that are, under Article I of the U.S. Constitution, powers granted only to Congress, not the executive branch. The 1977 Emergency Economic Powers Act gives the president broad latitude on financial regulation and foreign policy if a national emergency, described as an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” is declared.
The attorneys general argue no such threat exists, and that no president before Trump has imposed tariffs based on the Emergency Economic Powers Act.
“Congress has the sole authority to set tariff policy,” Rayfield said. “Congress has enacted various laws that allow the president to implement tariffs under certain conditions, but most importantly, certain safeguards. And it’s these conditions and safeguards that the president doesn’t like.”
Employment fears
Rayfield was joined by state Rep. Daniel Nguyễn, D-Lake Oswego, and co-founder of Portland-based Bambuza Vietnam Kitchen; Pat Hubbell, owner of Brooklyn Pharmacy in Portland; Graham Trainor, president of Oregon AFL-CIO, a federation of more than 300,000 unionized Oregonians working in construction, education, health care and manufacturing; Todd Nelson, co-owner of Bountiful Farms in Woodburn; Cody Sullivan, the first person with Down syndrome to graduate with a four-year degree from an Oregon college, and Ann Donaca, Sullivan’s aide and a retired educator.
Trump touts manufacturing while undercutting state efforts to help factories

Nguyễn said Bambuza, like all businesses, is struggling to deal with the economic insecurity wrought by the tariffs. He said the business has stocked many of its Vietnamese imports, such as rice paper, rice noodles and coffee, but he knows they will not last long.
“This survival mentality might save an individual business in a pinch, but it can’t be sustained, and it can be devastating for our broader economy,” he said.
Trainor said Trump’s erratic use of tariffs lacks a clear strategy, making them detrimental rather than beneficial for workers. He said many union members are “wondering if their jobs will still exist tomorrow.”
“What we need is a comprehensive trade policy that puts workers first,” he said. “That means targeting unfair trade practices, investing in domestic industries and ensuring that tariffs are used strategically, not just as political weapons.”
Sullivan has been applying for jobs unsuccessfully for three years. Donaca said that’s only going to get harder in an economy where hiring slows altogether due to economic uncertainty.
Feeling the pain
Both Oregon Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek and Oregon U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat, held roundtables recently with small- and medium- business owners to discuss the impact of tariffs.
Business leaders told Kotek April 16 they were frustrated at the speed and inconsistency with which tariffs are being issued, and some said their businesses might not survive if tariffs continue for much longer.
“We believe manufacturers our size are going to go under,” Emma Mcilroy, CEO of Portland-based clothing company Wildfang, told Kotek.
Oregon’s state economist, Carl Riccadonna, joined Kotek’s roundtable discussion. He has encouraged business owners to take a survey from Business Oregon, the state’s economic development agency, so it can gather more information about tariff impacts.
Riccadonna said the full impact of tariffs on Oregon’s economy — measured by growth of new or existing businesses, increases in hiring and decreases in inflation — likely won’t be known until mid-summer.
At a roundtable with businesses held at the Port of Portland Monday, Wyden said he and Kentucky U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican, would introduce legislation to end Trump’s tariffs as early as next week.
Wyden described it as “one of the most important matters I’ve ever been involved with in my entire life.”
“I think the stakes are that high,” he said.

Darin Chappell of Rogersville speaks in March 2024 during Missouri House debate (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).Disagreement over two competing versions of legislation designed to “protect ideological perspectives” in college campus-based organizations surfaced during a Senate committee hearing Wednesday.
Both bills were created to prohibit public institutions taking “adverse action” against belief-based organizations. As defined in the bills text, belief-based organizations are, “any political or ideological student association or any religious student association.”
“There is not a single student association in existence that is not protected by this bill,” said state Rep. Darin Chappell, a Republican from Rogersvilleand sponsor of the bill. “This bill just simply says that freedom of association is one of the premier fundamental rights of this country, and you do not lose that simply because you enrolled in a higher institution.”
But critics say Chappell’s bill could force schools to support groups that discriminate against students who weren’t allowed to join such groups, such as LGBTQ+ students who could be prohibited from joining certain religious-based groups. They prefer a Senate version of the bill that includes an anti-discriminatory provision.
Both bills prohibit enforcing any policy that denies certain “benefits” to these organizations that are readily available to other student associations.
“Benefits,” as described in the bill, are any type of recognition, registration, use of facilities for meetings or speaking purposes, communication channels that are sanctioned by a public institution of higher learning, other assistance and aid.
The House approved the bill in late February with a vote of 108-47.
Most of the discussion Wednesday centered around the protection of free speech and funding these organizations with student fees.
“We’re not discriminating against anyone,” said state Sen. Brad Hudson, a Republican from Cape Fair. “We’re wanting everyone to have equal protection under the First Amendment as it should be.”
Sharon Jones, who testified in opposition on behalf of the Missouri NAACP State Conference, requested the committee look at the language added to the Senate version of the legislation. It is an anti-discriminatory clause stating that if there is evidence that an organization’s viewpoint would cause campus disruption or “interfere with the rights of others,” the protections would not apply.
If included, Jones said it would, “make us neutral on the bill.”
That sentiment was shared among other witnesses who testified in opposition Wednesday.
“It’s something we think balances the needs of all groups on campus and doesn’t do anything to impact the underlying intent of the two bills,” Jones said.
Another concern brought up by those in opposition was that leadership in university-sanctioned student groups could be restricted to leaders who shared the ideology of those groups.
Chappell said this bill doesn’t mean students “can’t choose their leaders.”
“It means that students cannot be compelled by the university to choose leaders that do not represent their views and desires,” Chappell said. “Not just in religion, but politically, economically (and) sociologically.”

(Photo: Jennifer Solis/Nevada Current)Former Gov. Steve Sisolak and his fellow Democrats in the Nevada Legislature didn’t raise taxes.
But in 2019 they passed a couple bills that tried to maintain some existing taxes.
Neither of the bills they passed had been supported by two-thirds majorities of both houses of the Legislature, as required by the state constitution if enacting any measure that “increases any public revenue in any form.”
So Nevada Republicans sued, and won, and the Democratic effort — not to raise taxes but merely maintain existing ones — was ruled unconstitutional.
Fast forward to today, and Donald Trump, on his own and without consultation or approval from the legislative branch of the U.S. government,  has implemented a series of tax increases on businesses. Those businesses will try hard as they can to pass the cost of those new taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices.
And Nevada Republicans are fine with that.
Taxation by edict
A tariff is a tax. 
Specifically, it’s a tax on imported goods. 
U.S. firms that import goods from abroad are charged a tax based on the value of the import. Businesses pay that tax to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. 
Tariffs are every bit as much a tax as the sales tax Nevadans pay to state and local governments when they buy clothes or dog food or a car.
When the importer sells those imported goods in the U.S., naturally they try to pass along as much of the cost of the tax to consumers as possible. 
So prices rise.
Because Trump said so.
And Nevada Republicans are fine with that.
Like the state of Nevada, the United States of America has a Constitution, too. And like Nevada’s constitution, the U.S. Constitution also has some rules about raising or increasing government revenue.
Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution mandates that “The Congress” — not the president, even if it’s Trump — “shall have the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises.” 
Under Section 8, Congress — not Trump — also has the power “To regulate commerce with foreign nations.”
Nevada Republicans threw a hissy fit when Sisolak and Democrats tried to maintain existing taxes without what Republicans believed was proper approval from Nevada’s legislative branch. 
Trump hasn’t given a second thought to the U.S. legislative branch while he has raised taxes, and then paused them, and then raised them, and then exempted some goods from them, etc., in a dizzying array of madcap proclamations. 
A lawsuit against Trump’s lawless acts filed Wednesday by a cadre of Democratic state attorneys general, including Nevada’s Aaron Ford, notes the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act Trump disingenuously cites as legitimizing his one-man tax hike binge only applies when an emergency presents an “unusual and extraordinary threat.”
The only emergency presenting an unusual and extraordinary threat is Trump.
But Republicans who have majorities in both houses of Congress have thus far been fine with that. 
The same goes for Republicans in Nevada.
Strong leadership, NV GOP style: ‘Well, let’s see how it goes’
Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo did submit a humble plea to Trump last week, beseeching the president to repeal the tax on lithium imported from China. Oddly for someone who is fond of saying “no new taxes” when in front of audiences, Lombardo didn’t object to the import tax because it was a new tax. He objected to it because he fears it will stymie the growth of the state’s nascent lithium recycling and manufacturing industry. 
And although Lombardo has made clear time and again that he devoutly believes the ideal number of new taxes is zero, all he’s said about the threat Trump’s new taxes on imports pose to the the state budget, the state’s economy, and the well-being of his constituents is that Nevada will just have to “make adjustments on the fly.” Which sounds like a conclusion every bit as deliberative as the one behind Trump’s tax on imports to begin with. No wonder the two men endorsed each other.
Ever wary of being outdone in the art of folksy deflection, when asked recently about Trump’s new taxes on imports on KUNR,  Nevada’s only Republican in Congress, Rep. Mark Amodei, customarily filled the air with many words. But a single phrase among them encapsulated the rest: “Well, let’s see how it goes.”
Ask the Nevada State Republican Party (Fake Elector Michael McDonald, proprietor), and they’ll happily tell you that it is those icky Democrats, not the dreamy Republicans, who meekly go along with higher taxes. So even defeating a bill that would not actually raise anyone’s taxes, but would only reset taxable value of homes when they’re resold (to hedge funds, for example), is one of the party’s “top concerns” of this year’s state legislative session, according to a recent party email. 
And yet a scan of statements from the state party over the last several weeks reveals no mention of Trump’s tsunami of new taxes on imports, let alone an objection to Trump raising taxes unilaterally, i.e., by unconstitutional edict.
For the record, and because Trump’s multiple Queen-of-Hearts-style decrees accompanied by rampant flip-floppery can be confusing, the new taxes on imports Trump has proclaimed that are currently in effect include:

10% taxes on nearly all imports from virtually everywhere and anywhere;
25% import taxes on automobiles, auto parts, and multiple other products from Mexico and Canada;
145% import tax on goods from China, except for phones, computers, and the other stuff the tech billionaires instructed Trump not to tax.

Meanwhile, the “Liberation Day” import taxes — the “reciprocal tariffs,” as the grossly inaccurate Trump dubbed them — that threw markets (and your retirement savings) into chaos and prompted even some Trump supporters to shake their heads in disbelief and despair, are scheduled to resume on July 9. 
Unless Trump strikes “beautiful deals” with just about every nation on the planet between now and then. 
Which nobody believes will happen. 
Or unless Trump caves and backs down — as he already did once on the “reciprocal tariffs,” and as he’s indicating he will do for China — but then tries to save face by dialing up some new hare-brained inanity. 
Which everybody assumes will happen.
But as businesses and industries that prize stability will anxiously attest, it’s impossible to know what Trump will do about … anything … because Trump is a volatile and easily triggered scatterbrain who himself has little if any idea what he’s going to do next. 
Meanwhile, the damage Trump has already inflicted not only on the economy but on U.S. global credibility seems deeper, darker, and more irreversible each day. 
Trump is devolving the country into a backwater, an economic and political anachronism that traded its alliances and interconnections with, and leadership of, the world’s wealthiest and most democratic nations for membership in a decadent syndicate of lawless thugs — no longer the most powerful nation the world had ever seen integrally involved in promoting peace, progress, and prosperity, but a menacing carceral state wreaking of despotism and corruption, and shunned and avoided by the peoples of free and law-abiding nations.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)A federal judge has ordered the United States government to pay North Dakota nearly $28 million, finding that the executive branch “abandoned the rule of law” in its response to the Dakota Access Pipeline protests of 2016 and 2017.
In the lawsuit, filed in 2019, North Dakota requested $38 million in damages from the United States government — the total sum it claims it paid for policing and cleaning up the demonstrations.
In a long-awaited decision filed Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Traynor sided with the state, finding the Corps at fault for negligence, public nuisance and civil trespass claims.
“While North Dakota was drowning in the chaos of the protests, the United States dropped an anvil into the pool and turned up the turmoil,” he wrote in a nearly 120-page order.
Thousands came to south-central North Dakota to protest the construction of the crude oil pipeline in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which views the project as a looming environmental hazard and an encroachment upon Native territory. It has also accused the pipeline of disrupting sacred cultural sites.
Jury finds Greenpeace at fault for protest damages, awards pipeline developer more than $660 million

Demonstrators set up camp near where the pipeline crosses beneath Lake Oahe — a reservoir on the Missouri River managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers less than a half-mile upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Opponents urged the Army Corps of Engineers — and later, the federal courts — to deny the pipeline’s developer, Energy Transfer, the land easement necessary to cross Lake Oahe.
The largest demonstration camp was located on land managed by the Corps.
The protests lasted from spring of 2016 to February of 2017, when former Gov. Doug Burgum ordered protesters to evacuate the land.
Traynor wrote the Army Corps was legally required to enforce its property rights as soon as it became aware of the protests — either by requiring the demonstrators to obtain a permit to use its land or forcing the protesters to leave.
Early on in the demonstrations, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe was in talks with the Army Corps about obtaining a special use permit, but those negotiations fell through, witnesses testified during the trial last year.
In September 2016, the Corps published a press release stating the permit had been granted, despite that the tribe never completed the application process.
Had the Corps followed through with the permit, the agency could have prevented millions in damages to the state, Traynor continued. Such a permit could have required demonstrators to handle cleanup, incentivized protest leaders to prevent damage to the land and prohibited protesters from establishing permanent structures at the campsites, he reasoned. He said the agency could have closed its land if protesters refused to comply with these requirements.
The Wednesday ruling expands on a prior order published in December 2023, in which Traynor held that the Army Corps had violated its own permitting procedures by not requiring protesters to obtain the permit.
Traynor found that the Corps’ decision to allow protesters to use its land — coupled with the press release, which he characterized as an endorsement of the demonstrations — prolonged and intensified the movement.
The United States argued other factors were responsible for the protest’s rise in popularity, like the Corps’ pending decision on the pipeline easement, the tribe’s historic claims to the land and national media attention. Winona LaDuke, an Indigenous environmental activist, testified during the trial that the Corps’ actions surrounding the permit and press release did not affect her decision to be at the camp, for example.
Traynor in his Wednesday order called these elements “red herrings” and “immaterial” to the Corps’ fault in the protests.
“Certainly, protesters had their own independent incentives for why they protested,” Traynor wrote, “but as discussed above, the facts as adduced at trial show protesters were supported, enabled, and encouraged by the Corps’ granting of the de facto special use permit that gave protesters a refuge from which they could conduct repeated illegal and illicit activities.”
The United States has argued that the Corps responded the best it could in an extraordinary situation, and that it did not know the protests would unfold the way they did.
Traynor in his decision rejected this claim, finding that evidence presented at trial showed that the U.S. government knew early on that the demonstrations could balloon in size and become unruly.
North Dakota on multiple occasions asked for federal law enforcement to assist with managing the demonstrations, which Traynor said indicates the United States was aware that the protests posed a safety threat.
The United States also said that it cannot be held liable for the damages because the protests were protected speech.
Traynor said that while some protesters engaged in protected speech, the damages at issue in the lawsuit are not covered by the First Amendment since they resulted from violent behavior. He also noted the United States cannot use the First Amendment protections as a defense when no protesters are party to the case.
“The damages here were caused by tumultuous, unsanitary, and otherwise horrific conditions that caused significant violence to the land and responding law enforcement officers,” he wrote.

Participants in the protest, including those who testified during the trial, emphasized that not all were violent. Demonstrators also objected to the response of law enforcement in riot gear and tactics of private security personnel.
Traynor reduced the award to North Dakota by $10 million, since the U.S. government had already awarded the state a grant of that size to offset the cost of its emergency response to the protests.
The state also received a $15 million donation from pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners in connection to the protests.
Traynor’s decision comes more than a year after the case went to trial.
During the four-week trial, which kicked off in February 2024, the court heard from a wide-ranging cast of witnesses — including Burgum and former Gov. Jack Dalrymple, Native activists, federal officials and law enforcement.
It was not immediately clear whether the United States government would appeal Traynor’s decision. The Corps did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong and Attorney General Drew Wrigley called the decision “a major win for North Dakota taxpayers and the rule of law.”
“As outlined in trial testimony and Judge Traynor’s ruling, decisions made by the Obama administration emboldened protesters and ultimately caused millions of dollars in damage to North Dakota, while endangering the health and safety of North Dakota communities, families and law enforcement officers who responded to the protests,” Armstrong and Wrigley said in a joint statement.
Lake Oahe is the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s primary source of water. The pipeline’s path also includes unceded land recognized as belonging to the Sioux Nation under an 1851 treaty with the U.S. government.
The Dakota Access Pipeline has been in operation since 2017. In a lawsuit brought against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers by Standing Rock in 2016, a federal judge found that the Army Corps had violated the law by granting DAPL an easement without first conducting a full environmental review of the pipeline, which is required under the National Environmental Policy Act.
The judge vacated the easement and ordered the pipeline to be drained of oil until the Army Corps could complete an environmental impact study. A higher court in 2021 upheld the decision to pull the easement but ruled that DAPL could remain in operation, concluding that Standing Rock had not shown it is likely to suffer irreparable harm if the pipeline is not shuttered.
The environmental impact study is still in progress.
A separate legal challenge brought by Energy Transfer against environmental group Greenpeace related to the DAPL protests went to trial in February. A nine-person jury of Morton County residents found Greenpeace liable for more than $660 million in damages.

(Photo: Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Last Thursday, April 17, 2025, two people were killed and five others wounded in a mass shooting at Florida State University, in Tallahassee.
I am a professor at North Carolina State University, In Raleigh. We have, fortunately, not had a mass shooting on our campus, or perhaps I should say we have not yet had a shooting. We have come close. Last November an NC State student was charged with multiple shootings at vehicles near Interstate 40 in Raleigh. 
We are, ironically, fortunate that the alleged shooter manifested his rage away from our campus. And then, of course, there was the graduate student who shot and killed a professor at UNC Chapel Hill in August 2023, and the mass shooting at UNC Charlotte in 2019.
University campuses are open and welcoming spaces, as we want them to be. But this places our campus communities at some risk. Professors feel responsible for our students. We want to keep them safe, if (or when) there is an active shooter on our campuses.
I am a member of NC State’s faculty Senate (and its incoming chair). In 2023, we asked our university administration if classrooms, especially the large lecture halls that might offer appealing “soft” targets, could have locks installed on their doors, so that we could safely lock down and shelter in place if (or when) there is an active shooter on our campus. We were given many reasons why this was not feasible, but they all boiled down to this: the locks would cost too much.
In February, our faculty Senate returned to this issue. We wrote a memo to our university administration respectfully asking:

For a commitment that all classrooms in new or renovated buildings be lockable from the inside.
For a review of campus lecture spaces, to identify those large spaces that are most vulnerable 
That a plan be developed and implemented by the University to provide inside locks for all campus teaching spaces by August 2030, prioritizing the most vulnerable spaces.
That the design specifications for future buildings consider safety in addition to aesthetics.

So far, no action has been taken, and we have received no response.
Apparently, university leadership is not very worried about the prospect of a mass shooting on our campus.
What are they worried about? Protesters!
In February, the University of North Carolina Board of Governors enacted a system-wide policy that imposes new restrictions on campus protests, most notably requiring 36 hours advance notice for any “mass gathering.”
Apparently, according to our university campus and system leadership, it’s not bullets that will kill and maim my students and me. It’s free speech.
I note that I am, and I look like, a Jew. I have never felt that my safety was compromised by any protest on my campus, including those addressing the war in Gaza.
Under the guise of safety our system leaders signal their disregard for the First Amendment rights of our students. And under the guise of cost and feasibility, they express their disregard for the authentic safety of the campus community.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FSU-mass-shooting.jpg,,,2025-04-24 10:09:44.700168

Posing as tourists, the thieves entered the State House late in the afternoon and headed for the fourth-floor gallery overlooking the House chamber. 
The post The case of the State House cod caper  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","While much of the recent drama at the State House has focused on budgets, taxes, and immigration, there was a time when the biggest story under the golden dome was a good old fashioned whodunnit. Former state representative Josh Cutler has written a book chronicling two centuries of State House history. Below is an excerpt on a dramatic theft that occurred 92 years ago this week that once captured the public’s attention. “Steal all the Cabots, if you must, but spare our cods––in cods we trust!” April 26, 1933: Posing as tourists, the thieves entered the State House late in the afternoon and headed for the fourth-floor gallery overlooking the House chamber. Two of the men wore white saddle sport shoes and one carried an unusually long flower box under his arm that appeared to be filled with Easter lilies. One of the men was at least six-feet tall with curly brown hair and a polo coat and another was described as short and portly. A fourth man waited outside in an automobile. The House adjourned its regular business for the day at 5:18 p.m. and the men hid behind seats in the gallery while legislators, clerks, and staff filed out of the room below. When the coast was clear, the men reached high over the railing and cut two threads of metal wire that held an historic ornamental fish made of pine wood––better known as the Sacred Cod. The nearly five-foot long replica painted in silver signified the importance of the fishing industry to Massachusetts and had hung in the chamber since 1895. The tradition dated back even longer and earlier versions of the wooden codfish were on display in the Old State House well before the American Revolution. A committee tasked with reporting on the history of the “sacred emblem” in the late nineteenth century described the symbol in solemn terms:  “Let us take it in reverence and honor, and place it on high as one of the proudest decorations of this great hall; and let it remain there so long as this State House shall stand, a memorial of the Pilgrim, his privations and simplicity; an emblem significant of the hardiness, courage and faith of those who dare and defy the seas, and daily telling of the great and surpassing glories of Massachusetts and her sons.” After cutting it down the thieves carefully stowed the wooden fish in the long flower box. Bits of greenery fell out in the process and were later discovered on the House gallery floor along with a torn envelope. Once the Sacred Cod was hidden away, the men surreptitiously exited through the adjoining press gallery and made their way back downstairs. The thieves had scoped out the building the day before and studied the routines of the court officers and doorkeepers to facilitate their getaway. It was about six o’clock in the evening and the sun was just setting on Beacon Hill when they furtively exited the building via a side entrance by Ashburton Street. The theft was discovered by a watchful guard later that evening around eight o’clock and the State Police were quickly notified, along with the sergeant-at-arms and building superintendent. Police detectives inspected the gallery and scrutinized the walls and railings for fingerprints. A systematic search of the entire building was also conducted. Few leads were found. The theft of the Sacred Cod quickly captured the public’s attention and sparked numerous offers to help. Officials in Barnstable County held an emergency meeting and wired a message to the governor offering to loan their own sacred Cape Cod codfish to the Legislature until the Commonwealth’s “immortal and sacred” codfish was recovered. Plenty of anonymous tips, fishy rumors, and red herrings also flooded in. One lead took police north of Boston to the city of Lynn, where a Boston University student was mistakenly suspected of involvement. Another tipster claimed that the fish was being spirited away to New York by airplane, which led to one unlucky college student being deplaned, questioned, and searched by police until it was discovered he was the victim of a practical joke.  Police also conducted a search along the banks of the Charles River, mistakenly believing that the thieves might have intended to return the cod to its natural habitat. Another fishy report claimed that the Sacred Cod could be found in a five-foot box in the basement of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. When a search was conducted a box was indeed found but it contained only an unfortunate minnow. Some leads did pan out. Police were able to track down a florist in Cambridge who remembered selling a large flower box to a young man matching eyewitness accounts. The lead also matched up with the evidence of laurel sprigs discovered in the gallery. The trail of suspicion quickly led back to Harvard Square. It was well known that students at The Harvard Crimson and the rival Harvard Lampoon often committed elaborate pranks. Accusations quickly flew between the two feuding student publications, accompanied by threats of expulsion from the college administration. At one point the Crimson claimed to have evidence of the Lampooner’s liability and threatened to expose those involved if the fish was not promptly returned. Thomas Bligh, the lead police detective on the case, shared the belief that Harvard students were to blame for confiscating the cod. “It’s probably the Lampoon boys,” he told the Boston press. “They think it’s a prank. But it’s not. It’s serious.” Two days after the theft, with pressure and accusations growing, a mysterious phone call was placed to Harvard Yard Police Captain Charles Apted around ten o’clock in the evening. “I was asked if I was interested in the Sacred Cod,” he recounted. “I said I was.” Apted was given instructions on where to meet and that evening he drove to the rendezvous near the Chestnut Hill Reservoir. On arrival he spotted a car, described as a “roadster,” with two men inside and no rear license plate. He approached, but the vehicle sped away along the darkened road.  Apted drove in pursuit for about twenty-five minutes until the roadster finally stopped on a side road. One of the men exited wearing a mask and unceremoniously handed over the five-foot cod. Before Apted could commit any details of the encounter to his memory, the man had returned to his car and sped away. With the fish recovered, Apted immediately notified Detective Bligh and drove to his office later that evening to deliver the prized possession. By the following morning the Sacred Cod was back at the State House under the watchful care of the building superintendent. A few touch ups were necessary to fix three damaged fins but otherwise the cod was returned in good condition. Later that morning the sacred symbol was restored to its rightful location in the House chamber, except this time it was hung a foot higher so as to prevent any future “codnapping” attempts. Though Harvard Lampoon student editors were widely blamed for the theft, State Police decided not to press forward with any charges once the fish was safely returned. The Sacred Cod story drew national attention and was featured on the front page of Boston newspapers for three straight days. While ample prose was devoted to the case, the cod caper was also conveyed in poetry, including by one unidentified author: Appeal for return of a Sacred Cod “O shameless man,O cruel thief! Return our cod, And ease our grief! Oh, MassachusettsThere she stands So pleadingly With outstretched hands. O, steal the Lowells, If you wish, But spare, O, spare Our sacred fish. Steal all the Cabots, If you must, But spare our cods – In cods we trust!” Josh Cutler, a former Democratic state representative from Duxbury, is the author of Under the Golden Dome: Historic Talks and Tales from the Massachusetts State House.The post The case of the State House cod caper  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/055.jpg?fit=1024%2C800&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

Free.,National Dems to deliver more than $1M a month to state parties,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/national-dems-deliver-more-1m-month-state-parties,,"The Democratic National Committee will transfer more than $1 million per month to its state and territorial parties over the next four years in an effort to build state-level infrastructure and operations, the DNC announced Thursday.The agreement marks the DNC’s largest total investment in Democratic state parties to date and comes as Democrats try to rebound from significant losses in the 2024 election cycle.Each state party is set to receive a minimum of $17,500 per month, a $5,000 increase from the current baseline, the DNC said in materials provided to States Newsroom ahead of the wider announcement.Republican-controlled states will get an additional $5,000 a month, bringing their monthly total to $22,500. The GOP-controlled states will get that additional investment through the DNC’s Red State Fund.The DNC’s definition for a GOP-controlled state is one that meets at least two of the three criteria: no Democratic governor or Democratic U.S. Senator; a quarter or less of their congressional delegation is made up of Democrats; and Republicans hold supermajorities in both state legislative chambers.As part of the agreement, the DNC said it will host six regional training “bootcamps” for state parties per two-year cycle and will also hire new staff to the Association of State Democratic Committees.The DNC said the initiative also aims to help Democratic state parties with their infrastructure, staffing, data and tech operations as well as with organizing programs and preparation for future election cycles.DNC Chair Ken Martin, the former Minnesota party chair who was elected to lead the national party in February, called the initiative “a historic political investment unlike anything Democrats have done in modern times” and said in a statement it is part of a long-term strategy.“We’re putting our money where our mouth is to equip state parties with what they need to reach working families who deserve better, build long-term success all across the ballot, and gain electoral ground for years to come,” Martin said in the statement.“Elections are won in states — and that’s exactly where we will be investing our resources,” said Martin.Last week, Martin laid out the leadership board’s organizing principles, which centered on “organizing early, organizing always, organizing everywhere, and winning everywhere.”“You’re going to continue to witness a level of aggressive investment and organizing from this DNC that’s unlike anything we’ve done before,” Martin wrote in that memo.In a Thursday statement, Jane Kleeb, president of the Association of State Democratic Committees, said “state parties are the backbone of the Democratic Party, and through this investment, our state parties will receive the support they need to show voters that, no matter where they live, there is a strong Democratic Party in their corner, protecting their rights and economic opportunity against Republican attacks.”The strategy bears some resemblance to the 50-state strategy pioneered by former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who led the DNC from 2005 to 2009. Dean was scheduled to appear on a DNC press call Thursday.Critics during Dean’s tenure argued that spending in deep-red areas pulled resources away from winnable races in more moderate states and congressional districts.",,,,2025-04-24 10:09:44.700168

In the 38-page filing, attorneys general for Arizona, Oregon, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota[...]","President Donald Trump speaking at the 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland, on Feb. 22, 2025. (Photo by Gage Skidmore | Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0)A dozen Democratic attorneys general, led by the AGs in Arizona and Oregon, filed a lawsuit Wednesday arguing that President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs were illegally implemented and will cause irreparable harm to their constituents.
In the 38-page filing, attorneys general for Arizona, Oregon, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont urged the U.S. Court of International Trade to find that the president’s tariffs were issued illegally.
In the past three months, Trump has at various times declared and withdrawn the financial penalties on multiple countries. For now, the White House has settled on a 145% tariff on most products imported from China, 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods and 10% base tariffs on the rest of the world.
Another 57 countries were subject to “reciprocal” tariffs that were actually based on trade deficits, not existing tariffs that those countries had applied to American goods.
The attorneys general argued that the whiplash of constantly changing tariff rates has injected uncertainty into the country’s economy and said the president’s misuse of his strictly defined powers violates the U.S. Constitution.
“These edicts reflect a national trade policy that now hinges on the President’s whims rather than the sound exercise of his lawful authority,” reads the lawsuit. “By claiming the authority to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the United States he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the President has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy.”
Arizona AG Kris Mayes, who has mobilized her office to challenge the federal government’s actions in thirteen different lawsuits, called the tariffs “economically reckless” in a news conference announcing the latest lawsuit.
“As Arizona’s chief law enforcement officer, I will not stand by while the federal government imposes policies that harm our economy, violates the constitution and ignores the limits of executive power,” she said. “This lawsuit is about protecting Arizonans and businesses large and small, it is about defending our constitutional system and reminding this administration, yet again, that no one — not even the president of the United States — is above the law.”
The attorneys general argue that only Congress has the power to impose tariffs, and that Trump’s bid to circumvent that by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act is unlawful. The act, they wrote, makes no mention of tariffs, and only empowers the president to regulate, investigate or block trade while an investigation is ongoing.
Mills warns that Mainers will foot the bill for Trump’s tariffs on Canada

And, they argue, the requirements for Trump to act during peacetime haven’t been met. The act grants the president the ability to regulate trade between the United States and other countries if there is an “unusual and extraordinary threat” that poses a risk to national security, foreign policy or the country’s economy.
To satisfy that, Trump has justified his tariffs by accusing Canada and Mexico of not doing enough to stop the flow of fentanyl and China of failing to intercept the chemical precursors that are used to manufacture fentanyl. And while Trump relied on IEEPA to greenlight 10% tariffs against the rest of the world, he provided no reasoning that might comply with the act’s requirements.
The lawsuit also notes that applying tariffs to every product from Canada, Mexico and China violates IEEPA, because not every product that is imported from those countries is related to the president’s purported goal of addressing the fentanyl crisis.
“The Plaintiff states agree that the fentanyl crisis requires urgent government action, but the imposition of tariffs is neither an effective nor a lawful response to that crisis,” the AGs wrote in the lawsuit. “The (tariff orders for China, Mexico and Canada) lacks any rationale for the tariff rates imposed and bears no relationship between the goods subject to the Order and the claimed emergency.”
Maine farmers, brewers concerned about next round of tariffs

Maine leaders have warned that tariffs on neighboring Canada, in particular, could have a drastic impact on the state’s economy. Last year, the two traded more than $6 billion in goods. This includes about $1.5 billion in exports of many products from the state’s heritage industries including blueberries, lobsters and forest products, according to a fact sheet from the Canadian government.
“From home heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, and other refined petroleum products, to Maine’s paper mills, forest products businesses, agricultural producers, and lobstermen, the tariffs on Canada would be detrimental to many Maine families and our local economies,” U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, said in remarks in support of a resolution by Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia that would undo Trump’s emergency declaration targeting illicit fentanyl coming over the northern border.
It’s also unclear how the Canadian tariffs could impact energy prices.
ISO New England, which coordinates the flow of power for  Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island said 9% of New England’s electric demand was met with imports from Canada and New York. More than 5% of total demand is served by imports from Canada. Certain rural areas in Northern Maine that are directly linked to electric grids in Canada and have no viable alternative supply could be hardest hit.
Maine’s agriculture sector is also deeply interconnected with the state’s northern neighbor.
“I think our farmers are going to navigate how long can they hold off on passing through any of these increased prices to consumers, if possible,” said Sarah Alexander, executive director of Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, during a press call earlier this month. But “ultimately that means it’s going to come out of the profitability of the farm.”
This isn’t the first lawsuit the White House has had to contend with in the wake of its tariff policies. Last week, California launched its own legal challenge in federal court that similarly attacked the president’s use of his emergency powers to impose tariffs. And a Florida woman who owns a stationary business went to court to contest the fact that her voice, and those of other U.S. citizens, was ignored because the tariffs weren’t subject to congressional debate.
A group of small businesses also filed a lawsuit against Trump’s use of the IEEPA in the U.S. Court of International Trade on April 14. On Wednesday, a panel of judges overseeing the case decided against freezing the tariffs while litigation continues. A hearing is scheduled on May 13 for the court to consider the issue.

Where in the world is that language?

As the legislative session enters its final hours, tweaks and overhauls alike are coming rapid-fire.
Indiana’s retired public employees are likely to nab pension bonuses intended to boost benefits that don’t otherwise keep up with inflation — but with a 5% cut — under a final draft for House Bill 1221. That’s after a finance-focused Senate committee cut the 13th check and 1% cost-of-living-adjustment entirely. House lawmakers, however, sought years of bonuses.
Elsewhere, several contentious provisions were dropped from less-controversial underlying legislation. But some authors are hoping to re-home them.
It appears a ban on sleeping or sheltering on public property has been removed from Senate Bill 197, prompting rumors it would be inserted into legislation dealing with juvenile justice. But the final version of that bill is still outstanding.
Another prohibition, this one on government-supported “obscene performances,” wasn’t in a conference committee report filed on Senate Bill 326. But that report was quickly withdrawn and is still in flux.
Asked where the language might go, Rep. Andrew Ireland, R-Indianapolis, told the Capital Chronicle, “I don’t know any better than anyone else.”
And detailed language cracking down on illicit massage parlors was cut from the negotiated draft of House Bill 1416, which would require human trafficking awareness posters in gas stations and rest stops. Rep. Wendy McNamara, R-Evansville, repeatedly called it too “prescriptive.”
Sen. Mike Bohacek, R-Michiana Shores, authored the language after law enforcement raided parlors in his district. He told the Capital Chronicle that he aims to find a new place for a recast version that offers local governments greater decision-making powers.

Not long afterward, Palmer’s local visitor center dedicated a statue to the cabbage and the other colossal world-record vegetables grown in the area.
Now, at the urging of a leading visitor center volunteer, a state legislator from Palmer is proposing to enshrine Alaska’s giant cabbages in state law as the official state vegetable.
If adopted by the House, Senate and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, House Bill 202 would declare that “Giant cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) is the official vegetable of the state.”

	Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, introduced the bill, but it picked up bipartisan support almost immediately with the co-sponsorship of Rep. Genevieve Mina, D-Anchorage.
This is the third time Johnson has suggested honoring the giant cabbage. In 2020 and 2022, she introduced bills that would have declared it the state vegetable. Neither bill received a hearing despite bipartisan support.
It might be viewed as silly, but Johnson said that the bill serves a legitimate tourism and economic development purpose.
“Just like you have a state salmon, it’s a fun fact and a way to point out something unique about Alaska,” she said. “People throughout the world do not ever think about the fact that we have this amazing place to grow vegetables.”
At the Palmer Visitor Center and Museum, Richard Estelle frequently fields vegetable-related questions from tourists.
He suggested the bill to Johnson, who introduced it at his request. 
The son of a vegetable farmer, Estelle said he was looking up various state symbols and “got a little incensed” when he realized that Alaska doesn’t have a state vegetable.
“New Mexico has got two of them. They’ve got red chili and a green chili. And Idaho has the potato,” he said.
Those vegetables are symbols of the state’s agriculture industry, he said. Alaska recognizes mining with a state mineral, and fishing with a state fish. Why not agriculture?
“I thought agriculture in Alaska ought to get something. It’s an important industry, and so we probably ought to have a state vegetable,” he said.
After considering carrots and other options, he settled on the world-record cabbage.
While the Alaska State Fair has plenty of big vegetables, the cabbage takes center stage, Johnson said.
“The cabbage was the first one that became the big icon. And it’s the iconic vegetable at the Alaska State Fair,” she said.
“There’s never been any other place in the country that’s ever surpassed (the world record), and we will hold the record forever,” Johnson said. “Now, there is someone in Wales currently that is trying to beat us, and they can’t do it, but I’m keeping my eye on them.”

As California moves to sue President Donald Trump’s administration over tariffs, Californians working in the state’s wine, agricultural and port industries must navigate a murky economic outlook that could upend their livelihoods, writes CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay.
Igor Ivanov owns the Vinous Reverie wine shop in Walnut Creek. Because it sells mostly wines from Europe — where Trump has threatened 200% tariffs — Ivanov said he may need to make some changes, including stocking up on California wines or closing his shop altogether.

Ivanov: “I’d have to think about whether it’s worthwhile staying in business.”

At stake: The U.S. wine industry makes about $86 billion in annual sales, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, and California exported $1.3 billion worth of wine in 2022.
But tariffs don’t just affect wine sellers. Winemakers could face higher costs on bottles, since glass is mostly imported from China, as well as labels, corks, wooden stakes for vines and more. 
California is also a major exporter of wine, making up 95% of the country’s U.S. exports, said a spokesperson for the Wine Institute. More than a third of the exports go to Canada — a country in which some of its political leaders have publicly criticized Trump’s tariffs and warned against traveling to the U.S. 
U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, a Democrat whose district includes Napa’s Wine Country, said some of his constituents have reported that their Canadian business partners have canceled hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of orders. Potential sales to Mexico or the European Union are also on hold. One winery in St. Helena told Thompson’s staff that due to tariffs Trump imposed during his first term, it lost 90% of its business with China.
But Natalie Collins, president of the California Association of Winegrape Growers, said there could be one benefit: Tariffs on competing wines, including those from Europe, could help local California wineries.
That includes Bruce Lundquist, co-founder of the California sparkling wine producer Rack & Riddle, who agreed with Collins.

Lundquist: “I wish Americans would look at wines grown in their backyard.”

An inside look at mental health court

“I really didn’t know what to expect.”
That’s how Judge Ronald Owen Kaye described his reaction to CalMatters’ Joe Garcia after Gov. Gavin Newsom appointed him to the Los Angeles Superior Court in 2020.
Kaye presides over a mental health court, a key component of the state’s effort to implement diversion services amid a growing number of criminal defendants struggling with mental health issues. These courts receive alleged offenders who are incompetent, or at risk of being found incompetent, to stand trial. Through partnerships with county health services, the courts can also help connect individuals with treatment and housing.
Before becoming a judge, Kaye was a former legal aid attorney, a federal public defender and a civil rights attorney. He’s had a history of filing multiple lawsuits against the county related to failures for providing proper mental health care.
Kaye frequently interacts with defendants dealing with chronic homelessness, mental illness and substance abuse, and says he aims to “make people feel comfortable in court and make them feel like they matter.”

Kaye: “I’m always balancing these issues of liberty — people’s freedom; and treatment — getting them quality of care; and making sure the community is safe. That’s essentially what I do in virtually every aspect of my job.”

CA Dems split on housing

At the beginning of the legislative session, Democratic legislative leaders said they intended to push colleagues to focus on the state’s cost-of-living issues. But the narrow passing of a pro-housing bill, during a tense Senate committee hearing Tuesday, underscores a rift among Democrats who want to quickly build housing and other infrastructure projects, and progressives concerned with affordability and labor agreements.
As CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang explains, Senate Bill 79 would require cities to allow taller and denser housing construction near public transit stations. Sen. Aisha Wahab, a Fremont Democrat and chairperson of the Senate Housing Committee, opposed the bill saying that the measure didn’t guarantee that projects would be built with union labor, nor require new units to be affordable for low-income residents.

Wahab, in an interview with CalMatters: “Because there is such a need right now, developers are seizing the moment and experimenting with options that are truly a sweetheart deal for them.”

Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, the author of the bill and a vocal advocate for housing production, pushed back against Wahab, arguing that she only provided blanket opposition to the bill instead of offering possible amendments.

Wiener, at Tuesday’s hearing: “There’s apparently not a single thing in the bill you like.”

(Katie McKellar / Utah News Dispatch)Tears welled in Michelle Flynn’s eyes as she told a crowd of onlookers how for years Utah’s only family homeless shelter in Midvale has operated at max capacity — at times having to turn parents and their kids away.
“Our team members know better than anyone what it means to tell a family with children that we don’t have any room for them,” said Flyyn, executive director of The Road Home, one of the state’s largest homeless shelter operators. 
Until recently, the 300-bed Connie Crosby Family Resource Center in Midvale has been the only emergency shelter in the state exclusively for families with children. The dorm-style facility has been overrun — unable to keep up with the growing number of Utah families experiencing homelessness. Since 2022, upwards of 75 families at a time in the Salt Lake area have been on waiting lists to get into emergency shelter, resorting to living with relatives, friends, or in cars or tents, according to The Road Home.
But soon, there will be another place for struggling families to go. 
Unveiling FINCH

On Wednesday, Flynn and other state and local leaders celebrated the ribbon cutting for the Family Interim Non-Congregate Housing Facility, or FINCH for short. 
The new facility — expected to begin housing families in early May — marks the state’s first ever emergency shelter offering private rooms for families. Previously, the property at 315 W. 3300 South in South Salt Lake functioned as a Motel 6. Now, it will house up to 85 families, and has a maximum capacity of up to 400 people — though on average, depending on family sizes, it’s expected to house an average of 72 families and 340 people. 
“I want to make sure that everyone knows that the FINCH is not just a facility. It’s a reflection of our community values and ensuring that children and families are not on the street,” said Laurie Hopkins, executive director of Shelter the Homeless, a nonprofit dedicated to reducing homelessness in Utah and the owner of the property. 
In 2023, the number of Utahns in families experiencing homelessness increased by a striking 27% in three years— up from 5,520 individuals in 2020 to 7,033. That included 3,748 children, according to a 2024 report by the Utah Office of Homeless Services. 
Emily Wegener, general counsel for Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems and a member of The Road Home’s board, said that during her time volunteering at the Midvale family shelter, she’s seen “firsthand some of the challenges that congregate shelter” poses for families. 
Family homelessness is a growing problem in Utah. What should be done?

“Some families are able to face that challenge of congregate shelter better than others,” she said. “In some cases, it causes families to bounce back and forth out of shelter to friends’ couches, other shelters, and creates even more instability for children.” 
So Wegener said she’s “thrilled” to see FINCH open to fill an unmet need for Utahns and their kids experiencing homelessness. 
Each family staying at FINCH will have their own private room with beds, a bathroom, a mini microwave and a fridge. The main building also offers common areas, including a dining room — providing three meals a day — a play room, laundry room, and an outdoor area for pets. It also offers on-site case workers to help connect families with resources including schools, jobs, health care, and other needs while providers work to find them a solution for permanent housing.
Wegener said FINCH is needed now more than ever, not just because the Midvale shelter is full, but because Utah’s high housing prices continue to squeeze families.
“It’s really difficult to afford a place to live in Utah,” she said, adding that a two-bedroom apartment averages $1,390 a month. “For one person making minimum wage of $7.25, that is the same as 148 hours a week, or 3.7 full-time jobs. So even for two parents, it’s pretty much impossible to have a two-bedroom apartment if you’re paying market rate.” 
Families, according to The Road Home, will be admitted to the facility on a referral basis through Salt Lake County’s coordinated entry process, which is managed by the Salt Lake Valley Coalition to End Homelessness.

How Utah’s newest family shelter came to be
It’s been a long road for FINCH, taking years of financial and political wrangling to become a reality.
Shelter the Homeless purchased the former motel all the way back in April 2023 for $14 million, which included $10 million from the state, plus another $1 million in state funding for remodeling, according to Hopkins. She said another $1 million from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, plus other private donors and money from Salt Lake County, made up the rest 
Last December, the South Salt Lake City Council voted to approve FINCH’s zoning, one of the last hurdles for the shelter to open. It wasn’t until earlier this year that the Utah Legislature set aside $3.9 million in ongoing funding to pay for its operations. That’s still short of the $5.8 million needed to fully fund it year to year, but Hopkins said Shelter the Homeless will be looking to fill that gap with other public funds and private donations, which she said she’s confident will come through. 
“The philanthropic community, I think, will step forward and has indicated they’re interested in supporting us. I think Salt Lake County is another possible avenue for us,” Hopkins told Utah News Dispatch, though she added that she’s grateful for the money the Utah Legislature appropriated.

“Really, there’s been so much government funding that came into this project to get it up and running, and that was really important,” Hopkins said. “The state, city, county, they all had to invest in this to help us with getting families off of the street.” 
South Salt Lake Mayor Cherie Wood joined Wednesday’s ribbon cutting ceremony for the FINCH. As did billionaire Gail Miller, owner of Larry H. Miller Company and Utah’s wealthiest person. She serves on Shelter the Homeless’ board, along with Josh Romney, CEO of The Romney Group, a development company. 
Romney, who shared remarks during Wednesday’s celebration, said “two women in particular were instrumental” in making the FINCH a reality. He pointed to Wood — for being willing for her city to host another homeless shelter — and Hopkins, for urging state and local leaders to recognize the need for another family shelter. 
“Two years ago, (Hopkins) came to our board and said, ‘We need another family shelter, and we need to find it now,’” said Romney, who is also the son of former Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah. “She worked tirelessly to find the site and work to put the funds together to make this happen.”
Also crediting Wood, Romney said “it’s always a challenge when you have a homeless shelter in your city.” 
“Most cities say no. Mayor Wood is one of the few mayors in this state who says yes, and she makes things happen,” Romney said. 
Wood called the FINCH’s opening “exciting.” 
“This new shelter demonstrates what’s possible when people come to the table with ‘yes’ in their heart, and we figure out hard things,” the mayor said. 
Wayne Niederhauser, state homeless coordinator, also attended the ribbon cutting. He joked that when Gov. Spencer Cox appointed him to the role four years ago, “I thought things would happen faster,” drawing laughs from the crowd. 
He said facilities like FINCH “are very complicated and challenging.” 
“But they’re worth it.”

The Alabama Legislature began its 2025 session on Tuesday. His bill to ban drag performances in schools and libraries may also effect theater production, but he says he is working with an unnamed senator on an amendment to protect theater productions. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama House of Representatives passed a bill last week that would ban drag performances in schools and public libraries. 
But it could also impact theater productions statewide.
HB 67, sponsored by Rep. Scott Stadthagen, R-Hartselle, defines drag performances as “a performance in which a performer exhibits a sex identity that is different from the sex assigned to the performer at birth using clothing, makeup, or other physical markers.”
According to the Alabama Educational Theatre Association (ALEdTA), with fewer boys participating in theater in high school, girls often play boys’ roles to fill the cast. The association said the legislation could impact school theater productions.
“We all know that in the current environment where boys are not participating as much in theatre; this will have a negative impact on educational theatre,” ALEdTA wrote in a Facebook post Monday.
Historically, the opposite was true. In Ancient Greece, women were considered inferior to men and unfit for the stage, so female roles were played by men. The same was true in the Elizabethan era for plays by William Shakespeare. Premature boys often played female roles because of women’s limited social status.
The association is calling on its members to advocate for an amendment to the legislation in the Alabama Senate that would exempt theater productions from the restriction on drag performances. The association provided a letter template on the post for its members to send to their senator.
“This bill without needed amendments will force teachers to provide less performance opportunities for students. It will also heavily reduce the plays and musicals that we can perform in Alabama,” the letter said.
Stadthagen said in an interview Wednesday the legislation was not meant to impact theater and that he is working on an amendment for the Senate to make that explicit.

“It does not pertain to that at all,” he said. “The intent is not to harm theater or anything like that. The intent, of course, is to eliminate drag.”
Huntsville High School this fall planned to stage “Peter and the Starcatcher,” a Tony-award winning play based on the backstory of Peter Pan but switched productions due to the possible implications of the legislation. 
“This change was made thoughtfully and early in the planning process before casting occurred to ensure the production aligns with any legal and logistical considerations that may arise,” Craig Williams, a spokesperson for the school system, wrote in an email Wednesday.
Stadthagen said in an interview Wednesday that he had not heard of any theater productions being cancelled and said that was not necessary.
“They don’t need to be cancelling anything at all,” he said. “They have nothing to worry about, I promise you.” 
The bill awaits consideration from the Senate Education Policy Committee, which did not have its regularly scheduled meeting on Wednesday.

(Photo courtesy of Harry Reid International Airport)WWE is approved to receive $4.2 million in transferable film tax credits for WrestleMania 41 and related events, according to an application approved earlier this month by the Governor’s Office for Economic Development and the Nevada Film Office.
That tax abatement is on top of a $5 million sponsorship from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, which was approved back in May 2024.
The $4.2 million in transferable film tax credits represents roughly 12% of the $33.7 million total production budget WWE estimated for two nights of WrestleMania 41 at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas and three nights of wrestling events at nearby T-Mobile Arena. But $4.2 million is more than half of what the company estimated it would spend on local labor and at local businesses.
WWE estimated it would pay $2.6 million in wages to Nevada residents and $17 million to out-of-state talent. Both amounts, as well as $5.3 million in in-state spending on things like hotels and catering, were considered qualified expenses for determining the amount of film tax credits the company is eligible to receive.
The application, which is considered a public record, illuminates the operations of Nevada’s transferable film tax credit program, which is currently capped at $10 million per year but is being considered for massive expansion through a pair of competing bills. The application was submitted by Event Services LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of WWE, and approved by the Nevada Film Office, a division of GOED, at a meeting on April 3.
WrestleMania 41 was held at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas on Saturday and Sunday. Three other wrestling events were held at T-Mobile Arena on Friday, Saturday, and Monday. All five events were taped for broadcast on television or streaming services, which is why the company is eligible for film tax credits.
The weekend also included myriad related events, including a five-day “interactive fan experience” called WWE World held at the Las Vegas Convention Center, which is operated by the LVCVA.
WrestleMania is not representative of most productions that apply for Nevada’s film tax credits because it is a live event that generates ticket sales, which will directly generate revenue for the state through live entertainment tax and indirectly through tourist hotel rooms and sales tax.
How they got to $4.2m
When applying for transferable film tax credits, companies must disclose their total budget and break down what amounts are being spent on labor and other types of expenditures.
According to the WrestleMania application, which is dated early March, the company estimated a total budget of $33.7 million, including:

$2.4 million for Nevada stagehands,
$2.7 million for non-resident “below-the-line” labor,
$17 million for non-resident “above the line” talent,
$5.3 million in Nevada expenditures,
$8.6 million in non-Nevada expenditures, and
$260,000 for Nevada security workers.

WWE estimated their five taped events would hire 450 Nevadans for 22,100 hours. That works out to an hourly wage rate of $121.71.
As for non-Nevadan labor, they estimated 300 “above the line” people — those are the executives, directors, and top-billed performers like John Cena and Cody Rhodes — earning $17 million and 450 “below the line” people working 10,800 hours for $2.7 million.
The $5.3 million in non-labor in-state spending is further broken down:

$3 million on miscellaneous expenses,
$855,000 in freelancer hotel expenses,
$369,000 in hotels for talent,
$323,921 in equipment rental,
$106,000 for catering, and
$40,137 for props, stunts & gags.

WWE requested that talent expenses and building rents budget items be considered confidential and redacted from their otherwise public application. That is a common request granted by GOED. Cumulative spending amounts listed on the spreadsheet suggest around $62,000 was spent on building rent and related expenses.
TKO Group Holdings, the parent company of WWE, on Tuesday called Wrestlemania 41 “the most-successful and highest-grossing” in the company’s history, though it did not disclose any financial amounts. An estimated 125,000 people attended the two-night main event.
WWE stated in press materials and on its application to GOED that WrestleMania brings “more than $200 million in economic impact for host cities on an annual basis.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_5929-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 08:08:28.064797

A mob attacked about 125 protesters, including Dr. Gilbert Mason, with bricks, chains, baseball bats, cue sticks and pipes after they walked onto “whites-only” Biloxi Beach. 
“We called it Bloody Sunday,” Mason recalled. “They were waiting for us with pipes and chains and baseball bats and pool cues.” 
By the time dawn broke, more than 20 Black Mississippians had been injured. 
“Tetanus shots had to be administered, gashes were sewn, and eye and head injuries were tended to. Most of the demonstrators were beaten badly as onlookers, such as the law enforcement, stood watching,” the Mississippi Civil Rights Project wrote. 
Police arrested protesters instead of their attackers. Before the week ended, two Black youths, Malcomb Jackson, a member of Mason’s scout troop, and Bud Strong had become victims of the racist violence. 
Less than a month later, the Justice Department sued the city of Biloxi for barring Black Americans from these nationally funded beaches. In 1963, Mason and others conducted another wade-in to protest the segregated beaches, and dozens of them were attacked. That protest came 11 days after Mason’s close friend, Medgar Evers, was assassinated. Demonstrators placed black flags in the sand to honor the slain civil rights leader. 
Mason told his story in his book, “Beaches, Blood, and Ballots: A Black Doctor’s Civil Rights Struggle.” A U.S. National Science Foundation ocean research vessel is named after Mason to honor his legacy.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama Senate committee advanced a vaping regulation bill Wednesday after hearing arguments from the sponsor and an opponent representing the vaping industry.
HB 8, sponsored by Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile, would amend state law regarding the sale and regulation of tobacco, alternative nicotine products, and electronic nicotine delivery systems, often called vapes. It would restrict sales via vending machines, increase penalties for violations, establish new licensing fees to create a dedicated enforcement fund and require K-12 schools to adopt policies for vaping awareness and prevention.
Drummond described it as a necessary regulation and said that it would bring in about $2.5 million in revenue to the state coffers. There are currently no licensing or permit fees for vaping products.

“I just left the Prevention Day across the street at the Capitol, where there are teachers who brought students up, and the number one issue was vaping, and they were talking about how they don’t know what to do,” Drummond said.

Drummond also said the bill addresses underage violations, saying that when minors are found in violation in public schools or private schools, they will go to juvenile courts instead of adult courts.
Meghan Hardesty, president of the Alabama Vape and Hemp Association, called the bill “dangerous, ineffective and economically devastating” for regulating age-restricted vape shops.
“The vast majority of underage use begins in convenience stores and gas stations, not age-restricted vape shops that already require customers to be 21 and older and verify IDs,” she said.
Hardesty added that the bill harms responsible businesses while benefiting large tobacco companies. She proposed moving vaping to licensed specialty retailers that only allow customers 21 and older, similar to alcohol, if the goal is to curb youth use.
“We are not against smart regulation,” she added. “We want it, but HB 8 is not smart. It is harmful”.  
The bill moves to the full Senate for consideration.

An Alabama House committee Wednesday passed a bill changing the scope of practice for midwives in Alabama after a packed public hearing over the measure.
As originally filed, SB 87, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, would have allowed midwives to administer three parts of newborn screenings: heel stick, hearing screening and Critical Congenital Heart Disease (CCHD) screening, which can provide early detection of genetic or metabolic conditions. 
But in the Senate, the bill was amended to only allow midwives to conduct a heel stick and adds language prohibiting midwives from providing “any care” that is not in law or in an emergency to newborns.
“This bill started out with those three newborn screening tests included, but two of them were removed when the substitute was submitted over in the Senate. It passed the Senate, and so that’s where the bill stands today,” said Rep. Ben Harrison, R-Elkmont, who is carrying the bill in the House.

Midwives in Alabama were only allowed to practice after the state in 2017 started regulating midwifery and lifted a four-decade ban on the practice. Midwives have since then been fighting to provide more comprehensive care. The medical community has historically pushed back against such efforts, saying midwives don’t have sufficient training, especially in cases of emergency.
State health guidelines in Alabama require newborn screenings within 24-48 hours postpartum. Midwives must refer newborns to pediatricians, often delaying these critical tests. While midwives can administer screenings if a doctor is absent, they are not allowed to order these tests.
Alabama midwives pull support from bill after addition of ‘hostile language’

The new version also states that while a licensed midwife “may order and administer a heel lance within 72 hours after birth,” they are “prohibited from interpreting any tests or screens under this subsection and shall cause any results to be referred to a physician of the mother’s choosing who is licensed to practice medicine.”
“Today, I’m calling out a disgrace … SB 87 has been hijacked. As is, it denigrates the sanctity of motherhood, the safety of newborns, and above all, is a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” said Aaron Crawford, president of the Alabama Birth Coalition, who blamed lobbyists for changes in the bill.
Rep. Ernie Yarbrough, R-Trinity, said he opposed the bill as amended but supported its original intent.
“Choices and options are being removed or denied from Alabama mothers because it would seem special interest and a general attitude that our mothers and their midwives can’t possibly make good decisions and should trust the experts. I would humbly submit that 6,000 years plus of evidence would be different to that,” he said.
Maria Cranford, a midwife in north Alabama, said that national standards provide midwives are trained and educated in the care of mothers and newborns through the first six weeks after birth.
“This includes performing newborn exams, administering newborn screens, critical congenital heart screenings with referral… and newborn screenings,” she said. “All of which I’m taught students to do in clinical settings — not here in Alabama, because I’m legally not allowed to.”
Support for the amended bill came from the medical community, who said it would preserve medical standards. 
Linda Lee, executive director of the American Academy of Pediatrics Alabama chapter, read a statement from Dr. Nola Jean Ernest, a pediatrician in Enterprise. Claiming there’s no evidence that midwifery improves infant mortality rates, Ernest said that “all further medical evaluation and care” should be performed by a medical provider.
“Lay midwives attending home births do not have the equivalent training or clinical experience as pediatricians or neonatologists,” Ernest wrote in the letter.
Danne Howard, deputy director of the Alabama Hospital Association, also supported the bill as it passed the Senate and defended notions that “hospitals across the state have not abandoned labor and delivery.” Rural hospitals have faced financial struggle for years, which had led to some delivery units being closed around the state.
“Alabama Hospital [Association] supported the bill as it was passed by the Senate and look forward to additional work in years to come to see what other avenues that we can make great strides in improving access to care,” Howard said.
The committee approved the bill on a voice vote. The legislation moves to the full House.

All of them have featured Musk in their campaign ads. One wants the state to stop investing pension funds in Tesla. Another wants to force Musk to get tested for drugs.
Ashley Koning, director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers University, said it’s a “no-brainer” that Democrats hoping to capitalize on their voters’ disdain of the Trump administration would single out Musk for attacks.
“His vehicles have become symbolic and intertwined with greed and oligarchy and his kind of powerful billionaire status, as opposed to the everyday person and the person who is struggling,” Koning said. “Democrats likely want to take advantage of that.”
Musk, the wealthiest person in the world, supported Democrats through 2020, but in 2022 pivoted to campaigning for the GOP and urged people to vote Republican in that year’s congressional races. He was a key donor for Trump’s last presidential campaign, and the president tapped him to slash federal spending as head of the new Department of Government Efficiency.
But Musk has taken a big hit recently. He poured $20 million into flipping a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court race and lost. His favorability has tanked. And sales of Tesla have nosedived. He said this week he would step back from his work in D.C. in May.
Now, New Jersey Democrats are attacking Musk more than they attack their own rivals on the ballot.
“He’s the Democrats’ new boogeyman,” said Jeanette Hoffman, a Republican strategist. “The Democrats are looking to nationalize this election, but really, in the end in November, it’s going to come down to New Jersey issues.”

Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop last week called on the state to stop investing pension funds in Tesla, saying on X, the social media platform owned by Musk, that he “couldn’t believe that this step hasn’t been taken yet.”
“As Elon Musk threatens Medicaid, Social Security, school funding worth billions to our residents,” Fulop said, “there is zero reason to hold a direct position in Tesla.”
New Jersey held more than 1 million shares of Tesla in a pension fund valued at roughly $425 million in December 2024, which represented 1.72% of the fund’s total portfolio in January.
The campaign website for teachers union chief Sean Spiller has a section called “protect democracy” that warns people must “face the fact that the President and Elon Musk are doing everything and anything to make our lives harder.” In a recent television spot, Spiller referred to Musk as Trump’s “puppet master.”
Former state Sen. Steve Sweeney joined the chorus this week, rolling out a new television ad Tuesday branding Trump and Musk as “creeps.”
“When our daughter was born with Down syndrome, we had to fight to get the health care she deserves,” Sweeney says in the ad. “Now, Trump and Musk are threatening everything we care about, and too many Democrats are too weak to stop them.”
A new ad from Newark Mayor Ras Baraka released Wednesday features Musk’s raised-arm salute from the day of Trump’s second inauguration. The narrator of the spot says Baraka is the candidate “to make the wealthy pay their fair share, to stand up to Musk and Trump.”
The two members of Congress seeking the Democratic nomination for governor — Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill — have sponsored federal legislation targeting Musk. Sherrill called for investigations into Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency cuts and introduced a bill that would require Musk — an admitted ketamine user — to pass drug tests to maintain his special government employee status. Gottheimer supported a bill to block Musk’s access to Americans’ private medical and financial data.
The two recently came under fire for accepting donations from Musk’s SpaceX corporate PAC. Sherrill donated $24,000 of those donations to a food bank, her campaign filings show, while Gottheimer told NJ Advance Media he gave the $2,500 he received to other Democrats so they could “beat Republicans.”
“For many Democrats, Musk is symbolic of Trump handing the reins over to this billionaire and all that DOGE has done thus far,” Koning said.
The Musk hatred is not on display in the Republican race for governor, where some of the five candidates have pledged to bring DOGE-style spending cuts to New Jersey. Last month, Bill Spadea, a former radio host, joined a rally in support of Musk near the Tesla dealership in Paramus.
“Lots of proud President Trump supporters there to make it known that we support the America First agenda! When I’m Governor, NJDOGE starts on Day 1,” Spadea said on Instagram.

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland property owners will not see an increase in the state share of the property tax rate next year, when the rate will hold steady at the same level it’s been since 2007.
The three-member Board of Public Works voted unanimously, and without debate, Wednesday to approve a recommendation to hold taxes on commercial and residential properties at 11.2 cents per $100 in assessed value. The property tax rate on utilities will remain at 28 cents per $100 of assessed value.
Taxpayers are still likely to see their tax bills go up, however, even as the tax rate remains flat. That’s because all 23 counties and Baltimore City reported increased assessments for seven consecutive years.
Still, Gov. Wes Moore (D), who chairs the board, lauded his administration’s efforts Wednesday to hold the line on property taxes for the third straight year.
“I want to highlight that, because when I first introduced this administration’s budget proposal back in January, we made one thing very, very clear … the state of Maryland will not balance this budget on the backs of the working and middle class,” Moore said.
“Everything we were going to do was to make sure that working- and middle-class families were not just protected inside of this moment, but also that we can give just a little bit of extra breathing room for families that were actually receiving a whole lot of additional pressure,” he said.
Moore rejects call for veto as wave of sex abuse cases heads to the courthouse

The recommendation to keep the property tax rates unchanged was made two weeks ago by the Commission on State Debt, which is chaired by Treasurer Dereck Davis, who is also a member of the Board of Public Works.
State property taxes are used to repay general obligation bond borrowing. Currently there is more than $10 billion in outstanding debt. State law calls for the rate to be set at an amount sufficient to repay the annual debt service.
The current rate does not cover that amount. The difference is made up with hundreds of millions in cash from the operating budget.
In fiscal 2026, the state will use $156 million in general funds to backfill the debt service not covered by property tax collections. That amount grows to about $400 million a year later. In fiscal 2030, the general fund will kick in an estimated $500 million for debt service.
The rate-setting vote comes in advance of meetings with three major bond rating agencies in coming weeks, as well as a scheduled June bond sale.
Maryland enjoys a triple-A bond rating, the highest, from all three major rating agencies — Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. The high rating means the state pays lower interest on money it borrows.
The state has held that coveted “triple, triple-A” rating for more than three decades. Maryland got its first triple-A rating from Standard & Poor’s in 1961. Moody’s followed 12 years later and Fitch gave Maryland its highest rating in 1993.
Maryland is one of 13 states with the highest rating of all three agencies.
But there are rumblings and concerns about a potential downgrade on the horizon.
A year ago, all three rating agencies reaffirmed the state’s creditworthiness. Moody’s, however, placed the state on a “negative outlook.”
In its report, the agency cited the “difficulties Maryland will face to achieve balanced financial operations in coming years without sacrificing service delivery goals or adding to the weight of the state government’s burden on individual and corporate taxpayers.”
That report was released six months before the election of President Donald Trump and eight months before his administration began making good on his promises to slash federal employment and funds.
Last month, Moody’s released a new report naming Maryland as the most at risk “from changing federal priorities and policies.”
Those back-to-back Moody’s reports and continuing uncertainty at the federal level, as well as how rating agencies will react to potentially billions in looming sex abuse settlements the state could be facing, are stirring concerns about a potential downgrade.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)The federal judge overseeing the case of erroneously deported Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia agreed Wednesday to a week’s delay in discovery that was supposed to get the case moving.
The one-page order by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis came without explanation after the government filed sealed documents requesting a one-week extension of the original 6 p.m. Wednesday deadline to file discovery materials in the case.
That expedited discovery schedule had been ordered last week, after Xinis said the government appeared “to have done nothing to aid in Abrego Garcia’s release from custody and return to the United States” where courts would handle his case, as was ordered earlier this month by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Abrego Garcia, a undocumented immigrant living in Beltsville, was picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on March 12 and soon deported to El Salvador, even though ICE now acknowledges that he was still under the protection a 2019 court order that prohibited his return to that country for fear he would be harassed or killed by gangs there.
Abrego Garcia’s family — his wife and children are U.S. citizens — sued for his return and Xinis ordered him brought back by April 7. That deadline passed as her order was appealed to higher courts, but the Supreme court on April 10 largely agreed with Xinis and said the government needed to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return to the U.S.
But U.S. offiicials, all the way up to President Donald Trump, have said they do not have the power to bring him back from El Salvador. And Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has also said he does not have the power to return Abrego Garcia, who remains in prison in El Salvador.
Wednesday’s pause in the case also came one day after Xinis, in a sternly worded order, charged the government with a “willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.”
That foot-dragging included claims that information could not be produced because it was shielded by government privilege, attorney-client privilege, state secrets privilege and more that Xinis rejected as unsupported.
“For weeks, defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this Court’s orders,” Xinis wrote Tuesday.
While agreeing with the government that one discovery question from the plaintiffs was overly broad, Xinis rejected most of the government’s complaints about other interrogatories, or found its answers to them “vague, evasive and incomplete” and an indication of “willful and intentional noncompliance” with the court’s orders and the discovery process.
Despite the Supreme Court’s finding that the deportation was “improper” — “unlawful” in the words of Justice Sonia Sotomayor — Trump, and members of his administration, now insist that the deportation was proper and that Abrego Garcia is a member of the Salvadoran gang MS-13, even though he has never been charged and has no criminal record. If he was returned to the U.S., they say, he would just be tried and deported again.
Supporters of Abrego Garcia, particularly Democrats who have taken up his cause, said that’s all they’re asking for — a chance for Abrego Garcia to have his day in court.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who made headlines by going to El Salvador and forcing a meeting with Abrego Garcia, said on the Sunday talk shows this week that he was not defending Abrego Garcia the man as much as he was “defending the rights of this man to due process.”
That refrain was picked up by Democrats in Maryland this week.
Del. Jheanelle K. Wilkins (D-Montgomery), who took part in Wednesday in a virtual panel with EMERGE, an organization that pushes Democratic women to run for office, said Maryland has become an example of the Trump administration’s deportation efforts through the Garcia case.
“It is really an example that has spotlighted the danger of this administration, where we are seeing a lack of checks and balances,” Wilkins said, who sponsored successful in the 2025 legislature to protect undocumented immigrants  from unnecessary interactions with immigration officials at specific public locations.
“For the Supreme Court to agree with previous decisions and that this was wrong for a person who a judge has deemed can stay in the country,” she said, “who has been convicted of no crime, neither in the United States, in the state of Maryland and El Salvador … to be kidnapped basically and in cahoots with another country to be impressed is just really beyond the pale.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D), speaking to reporters Wednesday, said authorities here are only being told that Abrego Garcia “is moving around from prison to prison in El Salvador simply because Donald Trump says he is guilty of something.”
“A judge has not said that. A court has not said that. And so what we’re simply saying is bring him home to stand trial and then let a judge decide what exactly should be the fate of him,” Moore said. “Because so this is, this is not about immigration. This is about due process.”
“Are we going to follow the Constitution or not? Are we going to follow the word of the Supreme Court or not, because Donald Trump alone does not have say whether or not a person is guilty or not of a crime,” he said.
Moore said his administration is talking to the state’s congressional delegation and with Attorney General Anthony Brown’s office to look at “all available options” to ensure that due process is followed by by El Salvador, but he did not discuss details.
“I think we have a whole series of options that we are looking at right now ,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2209415187-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 10:09:44.700168

Dec. 3, 2024. (File photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)State officials approved a new financing plan Wednesday that will let the health department move thousands of employees out the aging State Center complex in midtown Baltimore, part of a larger effort to move state agencies into more modern facilities.
The Maryland Board of Public works approved an intergovernmental lease that will allow the Maryland Department of Health to move forward on consolidating 3,000 department workers into a new facility at 300 N. Greene Street in Baltimore, a project that had stalled due to financial challenges.
State officials say the move will help revitalization efforts for the West Baltimore area.
“Not only are they [state officials] upgrading and repurposing old facilities, saving taxpayer dollars, but they’re moving into historically underserved neighborhoods,” Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said in a written statement Wednesday.  “The Maryland Department of Health’s plan to relocate to West Baltimore is a prime example.”

The health department is currently spread out between buildings that make up the State Center complex in midtown Baltimore, as well as a few satellite locations throughout the state.
The move, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2026, will consolidate all health employees at the new Greene Street location, according to a press release from the Department of General Services.
“This location is the former U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) Metro West complex and is part of a 1.1 million square-foot campus, centrally located near metro, light-rail, and commuter bus, and sits blocks from the University of Maryland Baltimore Campus, Lexington Market, and Camden Yards,” the press release says. “This facility opened in 1980 and has been vacant since SSA relocated in 2014.”
The board’s vote Wednesday approves a new financing plan under which the Maryland Economic Development Corp. (MEDCO) will issue bonds to finance renovations and an expanded parking garage, while serving as landlord with the health department as the tenant. The previous landlord, Greene Street Ventures, will now serve as the developer for the move.
The state initially approved an operating lease to move the health department to the new facility in 2022, but market conditions in 2023 delayed the project from moving forward, according to Board of Public Work documents.
“These challenges included rising interest rates, changes in lending requirements, and increased project costs due to inflation,” the document said.
Without the new financing agreement, the relocation project would have stalled due to not having enough funds to move forward, according to state officials.
“This option will save the State as much as $80 million compared to the 2022 operating lease, extrapolated over the financing term,” ccording to Board of Public Works documents. “This will also permit the project to continue to move forward at this location without any undue delays.
“An additional benefit to this project includes the construction of a new onsite garage that will provide MDH [the health department] with 565 additional parking spaces compared to the 2022 lease (1,666 spaces versus 1,101 spaces),” the documents said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024_dec3_statecenter6_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 08:08:28.064797
,Mississippi Today,2025-04-24 11:01:24+00:00,Mississippi Today,Customers of some of the state’s worst water and sewer systems are seeing ‘astronomic’ rate hikes,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/04/24/customers-of-some-of-the-states-worst-water-and-sewer-systems-are-seeing-astronomic-rate-hikes/,Mississippi small water and sewer system customers are confronting costs of running  adequate systems.,"This is the second half of a two-part story on small water and sewer systems. Read part one here.
A December hearing at the Woolfolk Building in downtown Jacskon started to sound like an auction: Fifty percent. One hundred. Two hundred. Three hundred. State officials watched studiously from their dais as customers recited how much their water and sewer bills ballooned in the last few years.
Judy Johnson’s sewer bill in Raymond went from $16 in 2022, to $40 in 2023, to $52 in 2024, to $67 two months after that. David Huber in Natchez said his combined water and sewer bill grew from $50 to $108 in that same time. 
“This is just for sewer?” Kathy Hardy, also of Raymond, recalled thinking when she saw the rate changes.
The three of them are among 28,000 Mississippi customers of Central States Water Resources, or Great River as its subsidiary in the state is known. In 2021, Central States – which operates in 11 states, mostly in the South – arrived in Mississippi, where it now owns 123 small water and sewer systems.
In Mississippi, which has the lowest median income in the country, many Great River customers are seeing costs skyrocket for basic necessities that were or are still below regulatory standards. But for years, many of them previously paid low rates to providers who were, in turn, neglecting or underinvesting in their infrastructure. 
“It just cascades and everyone keeps kicking the can until a crisis happens,” said Central States founder Josiah Cox. “The butcher’s bill is coming due. These places are falling apart.” 
The result is a chasm between the perceived and actual costs of delivering water and sewer services. 
In 2014, Cox started the St. Louis-based company hoping to fill a niche: buying and restoring struggling small systems that other large utility firms wouldn’t touch. 
“Our thesis was pretty simple,” he said. “There’s small, failing water and wastewater systems all over the country. The giant publicly traded utilities don’t want to mess with them.”
Smaller companies often can’t afford administrative costs, like presenting rate cases in front of the state’s Public Service Commission. Larger companies aren’t interested because it would take years to see a return on their investment. 
While Mississippi officials at the time were happy to welcome a company with Central State’s resources, the state’s ratepayers gave Cox’s team a tepid reception, to put it mildly.

In 2022, as the company started transitioning ratepayers to new rates to fund improvements, the PSC received letters from 800 Mississippians. They described Great River as “greedy,” accusing it of “gouging” them with “unconscionable” rate hikes. 
“We are on a fixed income and finding it difficult just (to) pay our debts and put food on the table and pay for gas and meds,” one letter from a Senatobia customer read. “I pray your office will deny this increase request.”
As it turns out, Central States’ customers had similar complaints in Louisiana, Kentucky and Missouri, and ratepayers in North Carolina and Texas have called out the company over poor water quality and pressure.

Nina McGee, a Great River customer in Panola County, said her water bill used to be just $12 a month, which she admitted was “ridiculous.” 
“I understand an increase,” said McGee, who lives in the town of Pope with less than 300 other people. “I just don’t understand why it’s got to increase that much. It’s tripled in three years.”
In the Wellsgate community, just outside of Oxford, residents sent 132 complaints to the PSC from 2020 to 2021. Most bemoaned poor water quality or water leaks. Great River bought the utility later in 2021 and found that, among other problems, the previous owner hooked up an unpermitted groundwater well – a violation of both state and federal law – that bypassed treatment and created a “blending of treated water and raw groundwater.”

Over the next two years, according to data from the PSC, Great River made about $1.5 million worth of improvements, such as adding new pumps and capacity to the water system. In 2022, PSC filings show, the company proposed raising the average water bill in Wellsgate from $12 to $47, a nearly 300% increase. Dozens of Wellsgate residents wrote the PSC in opposition.
“In no universe does this seem like an acceptable course of action,” one email said.
The company also took control of some of the state’s worst performing small sewer systems, including the ones Mississippi Today recently reported on. Many of those utilities hadn’t raised rates in years. Nearly 30 of the small sewer systems the company purchased, Cox said, never charged a rate at all. Some of those systems depreciated so much that Great River bought them for one dollar each.

At the December meeting in Jackson, Central States engineer Jacob Freeman testified to the PSC about the condition of some of the state’s sewage lagoons, a common form of treatment for small service areas like a subdivision. Freeman described lagoons he saw in the state where so much sludge had accumulated that it “breached the (water’s) surface.”
“At that point, you’ve taken up all the volume in the lagoon, so whatever small amount of treatment that Mother Nature could’ve provided originally is no longer happening, and raw wastewater is short-circuiting the lagoon, going out the back end,” he said, adding that, in similar cases, he’ll find bloodworms or pathogens pouring into the receiving watershed. “That’s dumping into a creek where maybe kids play, or flows down into another body of water that could be recreational. It’s a very, very bad situation.”  
Freeman also testified that even with the high number of sewer facilities in the state violating their effluent limits for different pollutants – about one in three have done so in the last year, a Mississippi Today analysis found – others that seem to be in compliance could be circumventing Mississippi’s relatively lax testing requirements. 
Many states, he explained, mandate quarterly or even monthly testing, versus the “once or twice annually” the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality requires. So a utility that doesn’t meet permit limits, Freeman said, can choose to only be tested during suitable weather conditions when it’s less likely to have a violation. 
MDEQ Executive Director Chris Wells emphasized that an operator could face criminal charges for lying about their test results or misrepresenting compliance. But practically speaking, Wells explained, the agency can’t regulate every system the same way. 
“If you’ve got a system like Jackson’s that’s discharging (millions) of gallons a day into the Pearl River, that’s got much more of a propensity to cause environmental damage than a small lagoon somewhere in rural Mississippi that’s discharging 5,000 gallons a day into a tributary somewhere,” he said. “It’s not that we don’t care about that, we do, it’s just that it’s lower priority from an enforcement or from an inspection standpoint.”

In the roughly four years it’s been in Mississippi, Great River says it’s invested $27 million in system improvements, and has brought 35 sewer systems back into compliance. 
Some customers, like James Windsor in Pass Christian, say while the new rates feel steep, their service has gotten better. Windsor said his water bill went from $18 a month to $51, which he felt would be a fair price if it also included sewer.
“Are we getting our money’s worth? I don’t think so, but it is better,” he said about improvements to water pressure and customer service.
Others say they haven’t seen any difference in what they’re paying for, and also criticize Great River’s pricing model. The company spreads out its repair costs, meaning someone on the Coast’s bill may increase, in part, to pay for repairs in north Mississippi. Doing so, the company said, keeps bills affordable for small customer bases whose systems need millions of dollars in investments. 
“I don’t think that’s quite fair,” said Andy Horyza, who lives in the Turkey Creek subdivision in Olive Branch. “If you’re living in a brand new subdivision and your costs are higher than mine, well guess what? Your costs are higher than mine, you should be covering that.” 
Horyza, who relies on Social Security income, paid around $17 per month for sewer for about 20 years until Great River bought the system in 2021. Over the next three years, Horyza said, his bill jumped nearly 350%. 
The company’s rates vary. For a sewer system using a lagoon, for instance, rates are about $42 per month, versus $59 a month for systems with actual treatment plants. For water, average bills are around $44. 
In a February vote, state regulators at the PSC sided with their angered constituents, voting 2 to 1 to deny Great River’s latest rate hike. The PSC changed hands completely in the 2023 statewide elections. Southern District Commissioner Wayne Carr won his seat with a campaign criticizing Great River. Carr and Northern District Commissioner Chris Brown argue the company hasn’t justified the rates they’re charging. 
“The service hasn’t changed, but the rates went up extensively,” Brown said, estimating that other rural customers on average pay less than $30 a month for water. “So the question is why? You’re supposed to have economies of scale. As public service commissioners, we want to make sure that rate payers are getting what they’re paying for.”
Central District Commissioner De’Keither Stamps disagreed. Stamps, the lone opposing vote, said some people would be “outraged” if they knew about the condition of their water and sewer systems, and that it’s unlikely the necessary funds to fix them will come from somewhere else.

“I choose to operate in reality,” he said. “The campaigning is over. It’s time to govern.” 
Stamps also argued that if Great River appealed the PSC’s decision – which it since did in Harrison County Circuit Court – the company could then add its legal expenses to future rate increases. That case is ongoing. 
Leo Manuel, a Mississippi attorney representing the company, explained the previous trio of commissioners set Great River’s rate schedule, so most customers’ bills were set to increase regardless of the February vote. 
The reality, some experts believe, is that some customers of small utilities around the country are facing a seismic shift in the cost of their basic services, whether it happens now or later. Not only have many of these systems not accounted for the true financial needs of their infrastructure, but they also lack economies of scale. And for many small private systems, which don’t have the same access to government grants as public utilities, raising rates is the only way to make the difference. A 2023 federal report estimated that small water systems in Mississippi alone will need $3.4 billion in investments over the next two decades.

Greg Pierce, who directs the Human Right to Water Solutions Lab at the University of California, Los Angeles, said without significant public funding – even after historic federal influxes in recent years – water and sewer providers are faced with few other options. 
“I hate to be bleak, but what are the other alternatives?” Pierce asked. “The public entities are not stepping up to assist systems at scale. We haven’t really gotten serious about reforming the system or putting a scale of money into it that would really move the needle on helping small communities. 
“That was true even with the Biden administration, and that’s certainly true now. So I don’t know, it’s a little bit bleak.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/13104314/3X0A2429.jpg,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030

He is currently serving as the executive chair of Let’s Build Homes and as a visiting fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government Taubman Center for State and Local Government.If you’ve turned on a podcast, watched a late-night show, or scrolled social media in the past month, you’ve probably heard something about “Abundance,” the new book by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson. The thesis is simple yet powerful: America, especially in blue states, has over decades created systems that prioritize stopping things rather than building them. We’ve become experts at saying no.“Abundance” has struck a nerve — for good reason. “Abundance” is a call to action, a challenge to break free from what the authors describe as “the politics of blocking.” It’s about a country that’s forgotten how to build: homes, transit, clean energy, the infrastructure of opportunity.Sometimes Vermont can seem insulated and removed from national political conversations — it can be easy to think some of these discussions don’t apply here. We pride ourselves on being a little different, a little apart.But this one? This conversation is 100% about us.When Klein says we’ve built a political system that’s better at stopping things than getting them done — he could be talking about Vermont’s housing shortage. Because we’ve created a system that makes it incredibly hard to build the homes we need. Our state faces a critical housing shortage, yet the pathways to create more homes are gauntlets of redundant state and local rules, costly government mandates and a permit appeals system that enables obstructionists. As a result, the average Vermonter experiences soaring rents, impossible home prices and a growing number of neighbors without secure housing.That’s why we started Let’s Build Homes — to ensure this isn’t Vermont’s future. We are working to transform our state from one that excels at blocking to one that prioritizes building in the right places — and we are already having an impact.In this legislative session, we’ve supported a bill that will make it easier to finance and build the infrastructure — like water, sewer and roads — that makes new housing possible. And thanks in part to our testimony and the coalition members who contacted their legislators, this bill has now passed the Senate. We are also working directly with municipalities to modernize zoning and allow more housing in the places where it’s most needed.Next, by engaging the process launched by the legislature a year ago, we’re taking on one of the biggest barriers: reforming the outdated maps and rules under Act 250 that limit where and how we can grow.This isn’t going to be easy. Already we can see new groups forming that want to continue the politics of blocking. We must push ourselves to grow in a way that respects our cherished natural landscape and is better than the development we have seen in other parts of the country. Vermont’s future depends on finding this balance.But make no mistake, if we are going to end homelessness, be a state where young families can get a start, provide all our kids a good education, enjoy high quality health care throughout the state — if we want a future of abundance, not scarcity — we are going to have to grow.The alternative is a Vermont that becomes increasingly unaffordable, where only the wealthy or those receiving aid can live, where our schools continue to empty, where our rural communities are hollowed out, where our workforce shortage worsens, and where more Vermonters find themselves without homes. That’s not the Vermont any of us want.The politics of abundance requires courage. It means standing up to voices that reflexively say no. It means embracing change while being thoughtful about how we manage it. It means creating new systems for government decisions and action that prioritize results and speed over undue process. Let’s Build Homes is committed to leading this transition — from a state of blocking to a state of building.

(Photo via FWC)Back in the 1990s, when I was on the criminal court beat, I sat through more murder trials than Perry Mason and Ben Matlock combined.
Every case concerned a tragedy, but occasionally there were moments of comedy. One case involved two hitmen who were so inept, they got lost trying to find their target in St. Petersburg. They were so lost, they wound up in Tampa.
There was another murder trial of sorts recently that involved inept killers. In April, it reached its startling conclusion.
Criminal trials are always called “The State v. The Alleged Killer.” Not this one. In this one, the state wasn’t the prosecutor. It was the defendant.
The case didn’t involve just one death, either, but nearly 2,000. The victims did nothing to deserve their fate. They were manatees, and they starved to death because the seagrass they depend on for food was wiped out by the consequences of human pollution.
The case was styled as Bear Warriors United v. Lambert. That’s as in Alexis Lambert, whom Gov. Ron DeSantis recently appointed as secretary of the Florida Department of Environmental Prot– well, you can’t really say “Protection,” can you? The agency utterly failed to protect the manatees.
Because of the DEP’s failure, a federal judge ruled on April 11 that the agency had violated the Endangered Species Act. Nobody shouted out “Guilty, guilty, guilty!!” as in a famous “Doonesbury” cartoon, but they sure could have.
  Katrina Shadix of Bear Warriors United via subject.
“In a state where it’s so hard to ever win anything for the environment in court,” said Katrina Shadix, founder of Bear Warriors United, “this is a big victory.”
The question is: What happens next, in the penalty phase?
“We are going to be compelling the state of Florida to care about the Endangered Species Act,” predicted Jessica Blome, one of the attorneys who represented the Bear Warriors.
 Sewage apocalypse
The scene of the crime for these many manatee murders was the Indian River Lagoon, once considered the most biodiverse estuary in North America.
The lagoon stretches for 156 miles along Florida’s Atlantic coast. It was once blanketed with mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass. In those days, the lagoon boasted more than 600 species of fish and more than 300 kinds of birds, not to mention dolphins and manatees galore.

“The water used to be clear and the seagrass abundant,” said Peter Barile, a marine scientist who grew up near the shores of the Indian River Lagoon. “Now the lagoon is dominated by harmful macroalgae.”
He said one particularly bad species called “Caulerpa” has taken over.
What went wrong? For years, the state and local governments allowed pollution to flow into the lagoon, fueling a series of toxic algae blooms that killed nearly all of the seagrass.
Leaky septic tanks were a major contributor to the blooms, according to Barile. It didn’t have to be that way. In 2010, the Legislature passed a law requiring septic tank owners to get an inspection every five years to make sure they weren’t polluting the state’s waterways.
But septic tank owners rebelled, and two years later legislators repealed the inspections — a move the sponsor of the repeal later conceded was a mistake.
Once the algae blooms wiped out their seagrass, the manatees suffered, especially when the weather turned cold and they sought refuge in the warmth of the lagoon. That’s how hundreds of manatees became malnourished. The starvation situation grew so dire, biologists began tossing lettuce out for the hungry manatees to feed on — an unprecedented step.
Despite multiple warnings about what would happen if the seagrass disappeared, Barile said, “the state let things go on for decades and let builders and the septic tank industry continue dumping waste, and we got a Sewage Apocalypse.”

 Broken promise  
One of the people issuing those warnings over the years was Barile. Among his many attempts to convince decision-makers to do something, he met with a gubernatorial candidate named Ron DeSantis in 2018.
The candidate seemed open to what Barile was saying. He definitely grasped who would gain from reining in the pollution and promised to fix it.

Then, after he was elected, the governor opted NOT to solve the problem.
DeSantis did convene a panel of respected scientists to recommend ways to prevent toxic algae blooms. But when they turned in their recommendations, he ignored nearly all of them.
Instead, he hired an Israeli company to dump a hydrogen peroxide mixture into our waterways to chase the blooms away temporarily.
But the algae keep coming back because he didn’t do anything to stop the pollution that fuels it.
Not even after the manatees started dying.
 No smoking gun
In most of the murder cases I covered, the accused presented what attorneys call the “SODDI defense.” That’s short for “Some Other Dude Did It.”
Similarly, the DEP’s defense in this suit was: Hey, this wasn’t OUR fault.
While the death of so many manatees was “undeniably tragic,” DEP communications director Alexandra Kuchta said in an emailed statement to me this week, “the state of Florida has responded with unprecedented investments to improve water quality and restore habitats, especially in critical ecosystems like the Indian River Lagoon.”
  Jessica Blome via Linkedin
In court, “their argument was, ‘We complied with the Clean Water Act, therefore we are immune from being found to have violated the Endangered Species Act,” Blome told me.
To me, that’s like saying, “I was obeying the speed limit when I ran over that pedestrian, so I can’t possibly be held responsible for the tire marks on his face.” One doesn’t have anything to do with the other.
U.S. District Judge Carlos Mendoza apparently felt the same way.
  U.S. District Judge Carlos Mendoza via U.S. Courts X account
“Compliance with the Clean Water Act … is just one piece of the regulatory puzzle the state must solve,” he wrote in his 21-page order.
Manatees were dying because of the consequences of the pollution the DEP allowed to flow into the lagoon. That’s why, even though its actions may comply with the Clean Water Act, the DEP has repeatedly violated the Endangered Species Act’s protection of that threatened marine mammal, the judge ruled.
Don’t assume the judge was a pushover for environmental groups. Just last year, he rejected a lawsuit filed by the Save the Manatee Club and its allies that attacked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the DEP for setting inadequate standards for water quality.
The Endangered Species Act legal argument was a novel one, Shadix told me, but it proved effective.
The DEP’s attorneys apparently didn’t know how to counter the Bear Warriors complaint. They failed to call as a witness any scientists like Barile to testify, Blome told me. Instead, they called DEP regulators to talk about their water quality rules and enforcement, both of which have proven to be inadequate.
In fact, they conceded that, with the DEP’s current level of cleanup efforts, restoring the lagoon’s seagrass beds would likely take another 12 to 17 years. That’s a loooooong time to put up with dirty water, repeated algae blooms, and manatees going hungry (and dolphins too).
It sounds to me like DEP missed the point of the case. At one point during the hearing, Blome told me, the lead attorney for the DEP stood up waving a letter and dramatically announced that the manatee die-off had officially ended.
The judge didn’t think much of that move.
“Defendant believed this letter was a proverbial smoking gun establishing that manatee takings were no longer occurring,” he wrote. “But even assuming the [die-off] has ended, that would not move the needle in FDEP’s favor.”
That’s because the conditions that caused the die-off haven’t changed much. There was a previous manatee die-off in 2013, and there could be another one this year or next or some other time before full seagrass restoration.
“Is there an ongoing risk of manatee takings in the northern Indian River Lagoon?” the judge wrote. “The answer is clearly yes.”
Meanwhile, the lack of seagrass beds has affected everything from the manatees’ reproduction rate to their feeding behavior — another violation of the Endangered Species Act, which forbids humans from altering either one.
As for the DEP’s bragging about its recent efforts to clean up the lagoon at last, the judge noted that those efforts were “perhaps not so much admirable as legally required.”
 An appropriate penalty
I’d like to point out that Florida had a hand in creating the law that the DEP violated.
  Nathaniel Reed in 1969, via Florida State Archives
A major co-author of the Endangered Species Act was a Florida man named Nathaniel Reed — a Republican, I might add. Reed was a birder and a butterfly collector, and he loved fishing so much his mother joked he emerged from the womb with a fly rod in his hands.
The first endangered species list included quite a few Florida animals, including not just the manatee but also the panther, Key deer, and alligator.
The alligators have bounced back so strongly that they’re now in every single body of water larger than a mud puddle. That proves that listing a species as endangered doesn’t have to be the final word on their future. With hard work and planning, some species can be restored.
But this case marks the second Endangered Species Act case in the last two years that showed Florida officials under DeSantis haven’t been taking the law seriously.
Last year, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the DEP was doing an end-run around the act to speed up issuing permits for developers to wipe out wetlands.
The judge ordered the DEP to stop issuing those permits, in effect halting a lot of wetlands-destroying development all over the state. That includes a pair of new “towns” in Lee and Collier Counties expected to generate so much traffic they’re likely to kill off our recovering panther population.
In that case, the DEP’s defense was to say, basically, that they broke the law because protecting endangered critters is reeeeeeally haaaaaaard. Imagine a teenager complaining about homework and you’ve got the right tone.
“’It’s hard’ is NOT a reason to not comply with federal law,” an Earthjustice attorney told me after the judge’s ruling, enunciating what I think is one of the bedrock principles of the law.
The DEP is appealing that case, and my guess is that it will wind up appealing this decision as well. Our state officials would rather keep arguing than admit that they disregarded the death of an iconic Florida animal in favor of helping big-money campaign donors keep fouling our waterways.
By the end of this week, Bear Warriors United is scheduled to submit to the judge its proposed punishment for the DEP. Shadix and Blome told me they’re considering asking the agency be required to spell out how it’s going to speed up cleaning the lagoon and regrowing the seagrass.
If I were the judge, I’d make the penalty even tougher. I would require that everyone from DeSantis on down to the lowliest bureaucrat to march down and line up next to the lagoon. Then I would require each and every one of them to issue a public apology for not fixing this problem sooner.
Then, to really bring it home to them, I’d require them to do the apology right at lunchtime, and tell them they weren’t allowed to eat anything for the next six hours.
I don’t want this punishment to seem cruel and unusual, but I think making them feel a little of the desperation of the dying manatees would go a long way toward doing justice.

Matt Lehman, R-Berne, sits with his grandson on his lap before session April 23, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Among the bills sent to Gov. Mike Braun Wednesday was a Senate Republican priority measure to increase transparency — and scrutiny — around state government contracts.
Sen. Scott Baldwin’s Senate Enrolled Act 5 advanced for a final time from both the House and Senate with almost unanimous bipartisan support. Across both chambers, only Rep. Ryan Dvorak, D-South Bend, was opposed.
Included in the final draft of the bill are new rules for contacts awarded by state agencies and offices — including a ban on non-public, no-bid deals — and steeper expectations for vendors paid with taxpayer dollars. It also mandates “unfilled” government positions be eliminated, and requires state offices to more closely monitor and publicly report on spending, as well as in-flow and out-flow of federal funds.
Last-minute conference committee negotiations carved out exemptions for agreements between the Indiana Department of Correction (DOC) and private employers. Baldwin noted that some 1,300 offenders are currently employed through 13 DOC “joint ventures” with companies like Cummins, Goodwill, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indiana Pacers.
“These are very difficult to bid out. They’re very specialized, and so we’ve excluded them for that sole purpose,” the senator said Wednesday morning. All other reporting requirements will still apply, though.
Another exception was made for child support contracting between Indiana’s Department of Child Services and local prosecutors.
 Health care bills move to governor

Certain health care entities will additionally be required to report ownership information to the state as part of a transparency effort to detangle potential conflicts of interest under House Enrolled Act 1666. 
It passed the House on a 78-13 vote, with opposition from both Democrats and Republicans. The proposal had an easier journey in the Senate, where it had unanimous support. 
Providers like hospitals, insurers, third party administrators and pharmacy benefit managers will need to detail ownership stakes to either the Indiana Department of Health or the Indiana Department of Insurance, depending on their services.
The Secretary of State’s Office will also be involved in collecting and reporting data.

Senators urged their House counterparts to exclude owners with less than a 5% interest in the entity at the behest of small-time providers seeking anonymity — particularly dentists, who are no longer impacted by the bill. That language survived conference committee edits.
But House authors disagreed with the Senate’s additional confidentiality provisions, though bill does give overseeing agencies some discretion when it comes to public reporting. 
“The Senate added so much confidentiality that it was no longer a transparency bill,” author Rep. Julie McGuire, R-Indianapolis, concluded. 
The proposal, along with Senate Enrolled Act 118, both head to the governor, who previously signaled his support for such transparency measures. 
The latter moved with minimal opposition and would compel certain hospitals and health care providers to provide detailed reporting on their participation in the 340B drug program, which pairs drug manufacturer discounts with hospitals caring for underserved populations. 
Some critics say large health systems unfairly profit, prompting additional scrutiny from the state. The initial bill was amended to exclude certain Health Resources and Services Administration grantees.
“When it came back from the House, there was a concern that it may have excluded some hospitals that we wanted to report,” said author Sen. Ed Charbonneau, R-Valparaiso. “The conference committee report simply clarifies that.”
The Senate approved the measure unanimously but it had two opposing votes in the House.
 Casino, teacher pay bills also cross the finish line

Legislation to study relocating a poor-performing casino — or adding a new casino — will soon cross Braun’s desk, too. Senators on Wednesday concurred with House changes in a 37-11 vote.
Senate Enrolled Act 43 would require the Indiana Gaming Commission to contract out for a study to assess the top two regions, revenue-wise, for a casino license.
Author Sen. Andy Zay, R-Huntington, initially sought to relocate a failing casino operating near the Indiana-Kentucky border to the Fort Wayne area. When that effort failed, Zay overhauled an empty vehicle bill to create the study.
‘Destabilizing’ Indiana casino relocation study could also recommend new license

During its trip through the House, the legislation was narrowed from three regions, but expanded by striking relocation-specific language. The study would only take place “subject to available funding,” despite a new November deadline. As he introduced that amendment, Rep. Ethan Manning, R-Logansport, noted “the biggest hole in the market is northeast Indiana.” He indicated another possibility is Indianapolis. 
Sen. Lonnie Randolph, D-East Chicago, said Wednesday that he’d heard a location has been “earmarked” for Fort Wayne. Zay rejected that.
“Nothing has been earmarked. And that’s why we’re doing the study, to determine where the best locations might be — independent of any influences,” Zay replied.
Randolph also suggested a set-aside for South Bend, but Zay said the city is “already under compact” with the Potawatomi tribe and its Four Winds Casino. Senate Enrolled Act 43‘s text mandates an “impact assessment of a potential tribal casino in the region” and consideration of the “impact of a potential tribal casino on revenues.”
Another measure seeking Braun’s signature, Senate Enrolled Act 146, will raise minimum public teacher pay to $45,000 and bump the minimum percentage of tuition support that schools must spend on teacher pay.
The bill — part of the governor’s priority agenda — passed out of the House a final time in a 90-1 vote, and 47-0 from the Senate. 
The average teacher salary in Indiana during the last school year was recorded at $60,557, according to the latest state teacher compensation report. The lowest teacher salary reported was $40,000 — the current state-mandated minimum. The highest was $110,000. Teacher pay is ultimately set by local school districts.
The original Senate bill, authored by Sen. Linda Rogers, would have additionally provided 20 days of parental leave to teachers who have worked for a school district for at least six months.
That provision was ultimately removed, however, due to budget constraints.
“It was for fiscal reasons, not for policy reasons,” said Rogers, R-Granger. “It’s something I’m sure that we all want to work towards, but it is something that in local school corporations, they can still do today as part of the bargaining process. … I just don’t think this is the right time. There are a lot of reasons to do it. Unfortunately, dollars play into it, and I’m trying to be cognizant of the budgets of local school corporations.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri for MPR News)Minnesota has a shortage of affordable housing, forcing people having to live in encampments and cars and on borrowed couches.
According to the Wilder Foundation, Indigenous people make up 20% of the homeless population — but just 2% of the state’s population. 
I am an enrolled band member with the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, and I can relate to how my relatives may feel living within encampments. 
I was raised by a single mother, and we struggled to find affordable housing. There were times when we lived in a three-bedroom house with 11 people because we couldn’t find affordable housing. 
This was many years ago, and the cost of living — especially housing — has only gotten worse since then, rising every year. 
Even as the city of Minneapolis claims that encampments have disappeared, the Star Tribune reported recently that “a number of homeless people and those who help them are skeptical that closing encampments is getting people housed. … They say it’s pushing homelessness farther to the margins.”
Given what minimum wage jobs pay and what an apartment costs, we know many people are barely getting by. I know from my own personal experience the stress of living paycheck-to-paycheck. You choose which bills to pay on time, and which bills are more important than others, and hopefully you can pay the electricity bill with the next paycheck before it gets shut off. 
I remember having to live in a home with no electricity because my mother couldn’t afford to pay the bill — she had to choose to pay the rent or the electricity bill. Sometimes we had to light candles just to see in the house at night. This is just one example of the struggles of many low-income families. 
“Minnesota nice” isn’t so nice when you can’t find affordable housing while trying to get by on minimum wage pay. Minnesota needs to provide more low-income housing, so these families and their children can enjoy the luxury of a room to sleep in at night.  
Check out a bill at the Legislature (SF982), which is for the Economic Development and Housing Challenge Program, with a special emphasis on American Indian housing projects. 
The Economic Development and Challenge Program is for affordable rental housing that supports economic development and redevelopment activities and job creation within a community by meeting locally identified housing needs. It serves rental households in areas with incomes at or below the greater of 80% of state or area median income. 
In other words, exactly what we need. 
This bill would help the Indigenous population find housing and help more families live with the luxuries that most of us take for granted: a home.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN240229_070-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 07:01:26.815549

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The Trump administration is extending the deadline for states to submit their final proposals for a federal broadband program, further delaying an effort that’s still largely in the planning phase after more than three years.
States will have an additional 90 days to submit their final plans for the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, a federal grant program meant to expand broadband access to underserved areas across the country.
The extension comes as the Trump administration prepares to make changes to the BEAD program, according to a notice from the U.S. Department of Commerce. The department is currently reviewing the program “to remove unnecessary rules and mandates, to improve efficiency, take a more technology-neutral approach, cut unnecessary red tape, and streamline deployment,” the notice said.
The $42.45 billion program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, began falling behind schedule in part because of inadequate federal mapping of where broadband is most needed and a lengthy challenge process to the maps. As a result, the slow-moving program has some local officials and experts questioning its efficiency.
They anticipate that federal officials might change an affordability requirement, which mandates states include a low-cost service option for low-income households, or the type of technologies given preference under the program. That shift likely would be away from fiber-optic internet toward satellites or other technology.
Earlier this month, more than 100 state lawmakers from 28 states sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick requesting that any changes to the BEAD program be optional rather than mandatory. They argued that mandatory changes could undo their BEAD plans and delay broadband deployment by a year or more.
The BEAD program originally had required states to submit their final proposals to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration within a year of their initial plan’s approval. Citing “extraordinary circumstances,” however — the new federal review — deadlines for states’ final proposals will be moved, according to the notice.
NTIA declined to comment for this story.
All 50 states have had their initial BEAD proposals approved, unlocking a portion — often 20% — of the money the feds will provide. As of April 14, Delaware, Louisiana and Nevada are the only states to have submitted their final proposals for public comment, according to the NTIA’s BEAD Progress Dashboard.
Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina and Texas are the only states that have not made any progress beyond having their initial proposal approved, according to the tracker.

But Hall said her overall approach to working with Trump is “one of the smartest things” she has done.
“Whitmer is embracing Trump, she’s complimenting Trump, she’s investing time in building a bridge with Trump,” Hall said. “And I think as a result of that, our state is going to benefit, because we’re going to be in a position we were not in in the first Trump administration, where Whitmer can be an asset to help us get things done with President Trump.”
Whitmer has defended her Oval Office visit, saying she “stayed in the room because I needed to make the case for Michigan, and that’s my job.”
Whitmer wasn’t the only Democrat praised by Hall; he also said he has good working relationships with Lansing Mayor Andy Schor and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, who is currently running for governor as an independent. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But when he was asked about his approach to working in a bipartisan manner with those leaders, Hall went on a three minute tangent attacking Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), state Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) and Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel.
“All Sarah Anthony does is try to wake up and say ‘what can I do for Lansing?’” Hall said. “And I know you guys all like her because of that, but me, I’m the opposite. The problem is, when you get outside of here, there’s not a lot of common sense in Lansing.”
Hall said that Senate Democrats have a “negative governing philosophy.”
“We decided that we were going to actually try to have a positive vision,” Hall said. “Rather than just complain about the other side, like Winnie Brinks and Sarah Anthony and the Democrats in the Senate, we said what if we compared that with actually doing positive governing.”
Hall said one priority he shares with Schor is getting state employees back into the office in Lansing.
He committed to using the budget to get state employees back to Lansing.
“We’re going to do some things to get that going,” Hall said. “I think we’re going to push pretty hard on that to get the state workers back to work in person.”
Hall pointed to California Gov. Gavin Newsom as an example of states requiring government employees to return to working in-person five years after the COVID-19 pandemic.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AMR_0074-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 07:01:26.815549

He is one of four new appointees chosen by Gov. Mike Kehoe (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe’s makeover of the State Board of Education is nearly complete, with the state Senate set to confirm the last of his four new appointments this week.
The turnover on the eight-member board also means its longtime leadership has been pushed aside. That includes Charlie Shields, the former Republican lawmaker who has served on the board since 2012 and was its most recent board president.
Shields told The Independent he was willing to continue serving but supports the governor’s appointments.
“We’re in a good position to move education forward,” he said.
The shakeup has created some friction in the confirmation process, with Ash Grove Republican state Sen. Mike Moon and Florissant Democratic Sen. Angela Mosley asking pointed questions of appointees during their Senate hearings.
That continued on Wednesday, when Moon was the lone “no” vote on the appointment of Thomas Prater, an eye surgeon from Springfield.
 State Board of Education appointee Tom Prater, an eye surgeon from Springfield, listens to questions about his time on Springfield Public Schools’ board during the Senate Gubernatorial Appointments Committee hearing Wednesday morning (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Moon said during the hearing he had received complaints from his district stemming back to Prater’s time serving on the Springfield Public Schools Board of Education.
“There are some people in Springfield who were concerned about things that have happened on the school board after I left,” Prater told The Independent. “So I didn’t have much control over it.”
On the board, Prater helped in the hiring process of former superintendent John Jungmann in 2014 shortly before his departure.
Jungmann faced criticism, as reported by the Springfield News-Leader in 2021, over his diversity and equity training that some labeled “critical race theory.” He was also under fire for his choices on safety measures during the pandemic.
Moon asked Prater how he supported a superintendent who was a proponent of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and what that means today with a governor who has spoken against diversity programs.
Prater said Jungmann was “by far the most experienced and qualified candidate that we interviewed.”
“I don’t remember any kind of DEI discussions coming up in our interviews with him that would have given us the indication, one way or the other, where he stood,” Prater told Moon.
Mosley pushed back on the notion that DEI is harmful.
“You don’t feel that diversity is important,” she said, asking where Prater stood. “All the districts are pretty diverse, so you need to know how to effectively support each area of diversity.”
Prater said he was “right between” Mosley and Moon on the subject, giving an anecdote that he supported the hiring of a Black football coach over a similarly qualified white candidate.
The board is set up to not be dominated by a political party, with law stipulating there can be a maximum of four members of a party. Many appointees, on other state boards as well, take on the “independent” title to conform to this rule.
Prater is joining the board as an independent. His political contributions include donations to Democrats like state Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield and St. Louis Circuit Attorney Gabe Gore. But the majority of his donations benefit Republican candidates, with $21,000 given to Kehoe’s political action committee, American Dream PAC, and numerous donations given to former U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt. 
Prater said he has been an independent for “as long as he can remember.”
Shields has repeatedly spoken about board matters with a bipartisan, or nonpartisan, perspective. He told The Independent that the board is intended to be this way.
Appointments are eight-year terms, setting members up to look at issues long-term. These two pieces are “important,” Shields said.
He feels confident that the appointees he knows, Prater and attorney Jon Otto, will take the “same view.”
“I know them to both be really thoughtful, high quality people,” he said. “I think they’ll make great board members.”
Prater was appointed by former Gov. Mike Parson a year ago, serving in an interim capacity while a filibuster blocked full confirmation. He has been sitting in the audience at state board meetings, he said.
Tawni Hunt Ferrarini was appointed at the same time last year by Parson, but Kehoe did not reappoint her to the board and instead chose Brooks Miller for the seat.
 Brooks Miller stands with state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, a Jefferson City Republican, for a picture as part of his appointment to the State Board of Education in a committee hearing Wednesday (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Miller, former president and CEO of Jordan Valley Community Health Center in Springfield, takes on the role after recently serving on Truman State University’s board.
He told committee members Wednesday that his experience in community health will help him look for needs inside Missouri’s schools.
“I think that (community health) really kind of goes hand-in-hand with serving children,” he said. “It’s hard to teach a child that has a toothache or other illness.”
Miller is identified as a Republican in his appointment. He donated to President Donald Trump’s campaign and U.S. Rep. Eric Burlison, but also gave $1,000 to Crystal Quade, who lost her bid as the Democratic nominee for governor in November. Quade is from Springfield, which Miller has strong ties to despite currently residing in Sunrise Beach.
Last week, the Senate confirmed the appointment of Otto and Mike Matousek.
Matousek, a Republican from Kansas City, recently served on the Platte County School Board and is the former legislative director for U.S. Rep. Sam Graves.
In his campaign for school board, Matousek opposed mask and vaccine mandates and carried conservative stances on hot-button issues into his time on the board. He was the only member to vote for the district to take up an official bathroom policy that would restrict transgender students’ access to restrooms that fit their gender identity.
Moon complimented Matousek’s willingness to stand alone on an issue.
“You’re not afraid to take those issues on, or at least ask the questions and let them be deliberated,” he said during the hearing.
Matousek has made contributions to several Republican candidates, including state Rep. Josh Hurbert, a Smithville resident who works for Christian private school advocacy and assistance organization Herzog Tomorrow Foundation. Hurlbert also donated to Matousek’s campaign for school board in 2022.
Matousek told The Independent that he was approached about joining the State Board of Education and thought it over before embracing the role.
“Public education is changing in Missouri, and I’d rather be at the table,” he said.
During the Senate Gubernatorial Appointments Committee hearing last week, Mosley asked Matousek questions about his stance on open enrollment and charter schools, asking if he would support funding for public schools or lean on alternatives to neighborhood schools.
 Evergy General Counsel Jon Otto stands with Sen. Barbara Washington, a Kansas City Democrat, for a picture as part of his appointment to the State Board of Education in a committee hearing April 16 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Matousek is generally supportive of open enrollment, if the state legislature chooses to pass it into law, but is concerned about provisions that would obligate school districts to transport students that enroll outside their home district. But those decisions are up to state lawmakers, he said.
Mosley’s questions were halted after Moon whispered to the legislative aide of the committee chair, who then asked her to reserve the rest of her questions for time outside of the hearing. Matousek was confirmed by the full Senate the next day. 
The Senate also confirmed Otto, who currently serves as general counsel for Evergy.
Otto is a noted advocate of charter schools. He helped found Académie Lafayette Charter Schools in Kansas City and has served on the board of the Missouri Charter Public School Association.
He told The Independent he didn’t have definitive plans for the board, saying he had to “get in and see what is working” first but noted potential for “a lot of new things.”
Otto has made a few contributions solely to Democratic candidates, like a $500 donation to U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids from Kansas.
Gabby Picard, a spokeswoman for Kehoe, said selections were made with the governor’s priorities in mind.
“Gov. Kehoe hopes that the board will continue to address and prioritize increased accountability in school performances and student outcomes, supporting opportunity across geographic and socioeconomic lines and supporting non-traditional school options like charter or virtual schools,” she said in a statement.
Prater and Miller’s appointments must receive final approval in the Senate before they can take office.

The attacks are coming fast and from every direction.
While much of the public’s attention has been rightly focused on efforts by extremist state lawmakers to unravel Amendment 3 and roll back our constitutional right to reproductive freedom, a quieter but equally dangerous assault is underway: a federal effort to dismantle the nation’s only dedicated family planning program, Title X.
And Missouri is one of the first targets.
As the executive director of Missouri Family Health Council, I have a responsibility to sound the alarm. We are Missouri’s sole Title X grantee – the organization trusted for over 40 years to administer family planning funds to health centers across the state. From health departments to FQHCs to hospital clinics to community action agencies and independent family planning centers, these clinics serve tens of thousands of Missourians each year at over fifty-two sites, providing contraception, STI testing and treatment, cancer screenings and other critical health services, often at low- or no-cost.
For many individuals, these health centers are often their only source of care.
Now, that entire system is at risk.
On April 1, Missouri Family Health Council’s federal Title X funding was suddenly and indefinitely frozen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and in the meantime, our network of health centers was left hanging in the balance.
Let me be absolutely clear: if Title X funds are not reinstated immediately, clinics across Missouri will be forced to lay off staff, scale back services or shut down entirely. Tens of thousands of Missourians will be denied life-saving care. This is not theoretical – this is happening now. And this crisis is compounded by the fact that Title X is often the only health care touchpoint for our patients. Six in ten women who access contraceptive care at Title X clinics say it’s their only provider.
But the attacks don’t stop there.
While Missouri’s Title X program is in limbo, Congressional leaders are simultaneously advancing devastating cuts to Medicaid – the country’s largest source of public health insurance. The federal budget proposal would reduce funding to Medicaid by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade, threatening the health coverage of tens of millions of Americans.
Here in Missouri, over 1.3 million people rely on Medicaid — including children, seniors, people with disabilities and low-income families — to access basic health care.
For many Missourians, Medicaid is the only way they can afford health services; slashing Medicaid means rolling back eligibility, cutting critical benefits, and reducing provider reimbursement rates — of which will result in fewer providers accepting Medicaid and fewer patients able to get the care they need. These cuts will disproportionately hurt rural communities, people with low incomes, and those who already face systemic barriers to health care.
Let’s be honest: this isn’t about “fiscal responsibility.” It’s about making it harder for people, especially those historically marginalized, to control their reproductive lives and access essential health care.
Either one of these threats to the sexual and reproductive health care safety-net would severely harm our communities. Together, they are catastrophic.
If both Title X and Medicaid are gutted, Missourians will face impossible barriers to care. People will lose access to affordable contraception. STI rates — already on the rise — will climb even higher. Basic health care will be out of reach for hundreds of thousands of people.
These aren’t just “cuts.” They are deliberate choices to strip people of their agency, their dignity, and their health.
We refuse to stay silent while our safety-net is being dismantled.
We are calling upon Missouri’s Congressional delegation – especially Sens. Josh Hawley and Eric Schmitt — to stand up for their constituents and restore Missouri’s Title X funding immediately. We call on them to oppose all attempts to slash Medicaid and protect the essential programs that keep Missourians healthy and safe.
This is a moment for action. Lives are on the line. And Missourians are watching.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/stethoscope-chart-1024x666.jpeg,,,2025-04-24 07:01:26.815549

(Photo by Edwin J. Torres|NJ Governor’s Office)The Trump administration has terminated five federal contracts in New Jersey that funded law enforcement work to fight opioid addiction, violence, and hate and bias incidents, cuts that Attorney General Matt Platkin blasted Wednesday as reckless and dangerous.
The Department of Justice notified state officials of the cuts by email Tuesday and ordered the state to pay back all unspent and unobligated balances or face unspecified “enforcement actions.” The contracts, combined, are worth nearly $13.1 million, but Platkin’s office couldn’t immediately say how much remains unspent and must be returned.
Platkin railed against the cuts during a Wednesday media briefing and vowed “to pursue all options,” although he did not specify what that might be.
“There was no warning. We were not consulted on how this would impact ongoing law enforcement efforts in New Jersey. These are current grants in place. We have never seen this before,” Platkin said. “This is not a way to run government. This is not a way to promote public safety.”
The notices said the funding was cut because it “no longer effectuates Department priorities.”
“The Department has changed its priorities with respect to discretionary grant funding to focus on, among other things, more directly supporting certain law enforcement operations, combatting violent crime, protecting American children, and supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault, and better coordinating law enforcement efforts at all levels of government,” the notices say.










If they want to cut law enforcement programs that affect my state, I damn well want to be called, at a minimum.


– Attorney General Matt Platkin


Three of the contracts terminated, totaling just over $3 million, supported efforts to prevent and reduce hate and bias incidents in New Jersey. The largest pot of funding, nearly $2 million, was allocated under the Matthew Shepard & James Byrd Hate Crimes Program, which helps police and prosecutors do outreach and investigate and prosecute hate crimes motivated by the victim’s race, color, religion, gender, or other protected characteristic.
Also cut was No Hate in the Garden State, an education campaign Platkin’s office launched in September, and the Community Peacemakers Collaborative, a statewide community mediation program that trains people how to respond to bias incidents.
The cuts come as hate and bias incidents have risen in recent years, with 2,706 reported last year and 644 reported for the first three months of this year, state police data shows.
The feds also axed a $4 million grant that supported violence intervention and prevention work and $6 million allocated under the federal Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Program, which helps public officials develop diversionary programs to keep drug offenders out of prison and help them recover from addiction.
Such programs are life-saving law enforcement, “not woke liberalism,” Platkin said, adding that they’ve helped drive down violent crime and drug overdoses.
“To say, ‘We’re going to cut programs that protect people from bias, that help people with opioid addiction, that keep guns off our streets’ — it’s irresponsible, it’s reckless, it’s dangerous, and it’s going to get people killed,” Platkin said.
He added: “I hope the attorney general, Elon Musk if he’s involved in this, the president of the United States, starts thinking about the impacts that their decisions that are being made for political purposes have on the ground and affect people’s lives in communities that I am in every single day, that they don’t come to. And if they want to cut law enforcement programs that affect my state, I damn well want to be called, at a minimum.”’

Bradley Knoll was arrested in December 2023 and charged with domestic violence against his wife after an argument escalated over a young relative not getting ready for school.
Knoll eventually pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor in March 2024.
In a complaint against Knoll filed April 22, the JTC said Knoll’s guilty plea violated the Michigan Code of Judicial Conduct, which requires that all judges follow the law and “avoid conduct that erodes public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary.”
A second charge in the JTC complaint alleged that Knoll “treated the police with disrespect.”     
FC 107 Knoll Complaint 
According to the complaint, Knoll threatened the Grand Haven police officer who responded to the scene, saying that if he was not subsequently prosecuted, an officer’s “ass would be in a sling for a false arrest.”
The complaint requires Knoll to respond by May 6.
The Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission investigates complaints of judicial misconduct and incapacity, and can recommend discipline to the Michigan Supreme Court, which has the ability to censure, suspend, retire, or remove a judge from office.
Knoll was first elected in 2002. He was most recently re-elected in November 2020, when he ran unopposed for another six-year term running through December 2026.
He serves as the chief judge of the 58th District Court, after being re-appointed to a two-year term in that role in January 2022.
This will be Knoll’s last term as judge, because state law requires candidates be under 70 years of age at the time of the election. Knoll turned 70 in 2021.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Congress is now in recess through April, returning on May 3. This would be an ideal period for our Montana congressional delegation to meet with their constituents – wouldn’t it?
Don’t hold your breath. A check with the four Capitol Hill offices last week revealed not a one of them had plans for an event where he would take questions and provide answers – with the exceptions of Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy visiting a few high school assemblies to talk about service academy nominations they make.
Some low-profile, personally selected appearances such as Sheehy at a Belgrade community event or what Rep. Troy Downing’s staffer said were small-group or personal visits will occur but there won’t be advance notice to the public. Reporters aren’t welcome – Sheehy turned his back on a television crew after his talk in Miles City. It seems the best way to keep track of them is to get your own “X” account which each uses to boast of his activities. 
Meanwhile, Montana voters have questions, and all four of our millionaire congressmen have pledged to represent all of us, not just those who cast ballots for them.
What if folks requested time of them by using congressional websites to fill out the online scheduling request form each has? Bear in mind that each request requires a lot of information such as name of the host, issue area, number of attendees, preferred dates and times, location and reason for meeting. Each also wants to know in advance the names and hometowns of meeting attendees.
As there is no information in the request forms for any of the four regarding how requests are accepted, we might assume that any topic about the congressman’s work would be regarded as an opportunity to engage in good constituent interchange.
I would like to suggest several topics for voters asking for a meeting or appearance as these questions are being raised across Montana:

Do you have input or prior notification into agency staff and funding decisions handed down by Department Of Government Efficiency?
Do you believe DOGE does enough research and verification before issuing its far-reaching judgments?
As each of you have had corporate experience and responsibility, would you have imposed draconian personnel and funding cuts without fully understanding employee roles and responsibilities in your organization?
Why are government agencies being dismantled without prior congressional involvement since it was Congress that enabled them in the first place?
What will be the role of the 200-some committees and sub-committees in re-forming our government agencies after staff and funding reductions demanded by DOGE?
What is your level of concern for DOGE infiltration in protected information areas held by the Social Security Administration, IRS, Medicare and Medicaid programs and departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Interior, Treasury, and others?
Do you support the Supreme Court decision that undocumented immigrants must receive legal due process before being deported?

Here is my point: Our state’s congressional delegation is heeding the orders of the leaders of the House and Senate reelection campaigns to stop holding in-person town halls. We are not all radical leftists, Marxists, Socialists, deranged Democrats, America-haters and all the other insulting labels being attached to us, citizens who honestly questioning what is happening to our country.

If passengers don’t have a Idaho Star Card, they can use another form of federally-accepted identification at airport security checkpoints, including a U.S. passport, Global Entry card, U.S. Department of Defense ID, military ID or an acceptable photo identification card issued by a federally recognized Native American tribe.
“If you arrive at an airport without a Star Card or another acceptable document, you may be delayed and undergo additional examination,” Idaho Transportation Department officials said in a press release. “This can cause passengers to miss flights.”
  What do you need to provide to obtain an Idaho Star Card? 

To obtain the Idaho Star Card, Idahoans need to provide their Social Security card and two documents proving Idaho residency, such as current utility bills or a mortgage statement. (A list of the documents required to obtain an Idaho Star Card is available online.)

Even though the Real ID/Idaho Star Card enforcement begins May 7, time is already tight. Idahoans who need a Star Card are required to visit an Idaho driver’s license office in person and present a series of documents to obtain the Idaho Star Card. Many Idaho driver’s license offices operate by appointment only, and availability may be several weeks out.
Additionally, it may take up to two weeks for the physical Star Card to be mailed to Idahoans.  
Due to the tight timeline, state transportation officials are offering a couple of tips. 
First, they said Idahoans can visit any county driver’s license office in the state to obtain an Idaho Star Card. If the local office in their county is not accepting appointments in time, transportation officials encourage Idahoans to check with another county driver’s license office for faster service.
Second, Idaho Division of Motor Vehicles officials are encouraging other Idahoans who don’t need an Idaho Star Card or who already have an Idaho Star Card to free up space at physical county driver’s license offices by using online Idaho DMV services. Idahoans can free up space at county DMV offices by going online to handle other tasks, like renewing their vehicle registration, changing their address or renewing an existing driver’s license.
“Online renewals help reduce in-office wait times at locations that allow walk-ins, making it easier and more efficient for those who need a REAL ID (Star Card) to complete their transactions,” Idaho Transportation Department officials said in a press release issued Tuesday.
 



 If Idahoans don’t obtain an Idaho Star Card by May 7 enforcement deadline, they can use the following federally-approved IDs at airport securIty checkpoints 


State-issued Enhanced Driver’s License
U.S. passport
U.S. passport card
DHS trusted traveler cards (Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, FAST)
U.S. Department of Defense ID, including IDs issued to dependents

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Green Bay-area legislators say the city and state are prepared for the “once-in-a-generation” tourism coming to the region when the NFL draft starts in the city Thursday. 
Green Bay is accustomed to hosting at least eight Packers home games each year, but the draft is expected to bring up to four times as many people to the city as a typical game, according to state Rep. David Steffen (R-Howard). Hotels are booked as far south as Milwaukee and as far west as Wausau, he said, and with that comes additional strain on local resources. 
“We heard early on that public safety led by the city of Green Bay had real concerns at the ballooning costs at having this event policed,” state Rep. Amaad Rivera-Wagner (D-Green Bay) said. “So they were inviting the county, the state, other officers from outside of the region to come help with the draft, given that we wanted to make sure it was an incredibly safe event in our incredibly safe community. But you know, we want to be aware of things like human trafficking, other challenges, potentially debaucherous behavior, and that footprint between the downtown and Lambeau Field would require more public safety officials, including EMS services, than we even had on hand.”
In the last biennial budget, state lawmakers set aside $2 million to support the draft and in his budget proposal this year, Gov. Tony Evers requested $1 million to assist the city with additional expenses. While the Republican-controlled Joint Finance Committee rejected Evers’ proposal, Steffen and Rep. Ben Franklin (R-De Pere) have requested $1.25 million in the budget to reimburse public safety departments in Green Bay, Brown County and Ashwaubenon for the added costs incurred in planning for and managing the hundreds of thousands of visitors. 
Steffen told the Wisconsin Examiner his proposal is better because it is specifically carved out for police and fire departments but that the additional $1.25 million — funded out of the state’s nearly $5 billion budget surplus — will help local officials manage the event while still making it a net benefit for the state. He said he anticipates the draft generating $4.5 million in sales tax revenue for the state. 
“So this is still a net financial winner for the state, but having the county, city and village shoulder all those expenses on the property taxpayers for this statewide benefiting event doesn’t seem appropriate,” Steffen said. 
Cleveland, Detroit and Kansas City have all hosted the NFL draft in recent years, but despite the event’s success in other midwestern cities, both Rivera-Wagner and Steffen say Green Bay’s status as the smallest city in the country to be the home of a major professional sports team makes the event here unique. 
“I think a lot of people are going to be coming because of the unique nature of Lambeau Field and Green Bay in professional sports,” Steffen said. “There is nothing like it anywhere else in the nation in terms of an experience.”
Last year, business owners in the Milwaukee area were left frustrated after the city hosted the Republican National Convention because of its muted benefit to local businesses. Rivera-Wagner, who worked as chief of staff for Green Bay Mayor Eric Genrich prior to his election to the Legislature, said the city met with officials from Detroit and Kansas City to learn how to make sure the draft benefits the city at large and not just the area around Lambeau Field. 
“You have to be purposeful to make these large-scale events impact the larger community, because, in and of themselves, if they’re overly contained, they cannot necessarily have the impact that you might anticipate,” he said. 
The city has set up a series of events in its downtown area, including a kringle making competition, a 5k run and an early opening of the city’s normal downtown farmer’s market before its typical May start. These events, according to Rivera-Wagner, are meant to engage locals and visitors while not causing the event to cast such a large footprint that people trying to avoid the crowds can’t do so. 
“We took those lessons to heart and created this entire downtown experience based on the feedback that we learned from Kansas City and Detroit about celebrating our community, making sure this event isn’t just for outsiders, that is also for the residents of our community and make sure that economic footprint is as big, as broad as possible without interfering with the people who want to opt out,” he said. 
Steffen said that even though people visit Green Bay from elsewhere each home-game Sunday during football season, they often fly in and out quickly. But because the draft is a three-day event — with lots of down time before a fan’s team makes its pick each round — the draft gives Green Bay a better opportunity to show itself off. 
“Because this is a multi-day event where the majority of the activity is in the afternoon and evening, there’s going to be lots of opportunity in the early parts of each day for people to experience the rest of Green Bay,” he said. “And so we have free transportation arranged throughout the city, from the various hotels to the draft experience, as well as to places like our vibrant downtown areas and our state renowned amusement park Bay Beach. So these are things that I think we’ll be taking advantage of at a level that far exceeds a typical Packer game.”

A former library official is pushing back against the political forces that ended her decades-long career, as the Legislature enters the debate over library books.
The post Legal fight over Gillette librarian’s firing expands as Wyoming lawmakers weigh action appeared first on WyoFile .","A former library official is pushing back against the political forces that ended her decades-long career in the Campbell County Public Library system, bringing her second of two federal lawsuits this month, accusing local government and an activist family of discrimination and wrongful termination. 
The Campbell County Public Library System Board of Trustees fired Terri Lesley from her job in July 2023, after the director of the county library system resisted calls to censure books dealing with questions of sexuality among teens and young adults, particularly LGBTQ+ youth. 
Two months after her firing, Lesley sued members of a family, the Bennetts, who had prominently advocated for her removal as library director. This week, she brought a new federal lawsuit against the county, its board of commissioners, the library board and individual members of both government boards. The new suit accuses local officials of violating the First Amendment’s right to free speech and firing Lesley in a retaliatory and discriminatory way. 
Sage Bear, who sits on the library board and is the wife of House Appropriations Chairman and Wyoming Freedom Caucus leader John Bear, is one of the defendants. Lesley’s lawsuit alleges Sage Bear played a key role in driving the librarian from her job. 
By text message, Rep. Bear said he believed his wife had been counseled not to comment by her attorneys. WyoFile reached out to the private attorneys on both sides of Lesley’s lawsuits, including her Denver-based law firm, but did not receive responses by day’s end Wednesday.

A representative for the Campbell County Attorney’s office said it was too early for the agency to comment on the lawsuit against the county, which was filed Monday. Court records indicate the county has yet to be served with the lawsuit. 
Lesley notched a legal victory in her first lawsuit earlier this month, as U.S. District Court of Wyoming Judge Alan Johnson ruled that half of her claims against the Bennetts can proceed to trial. He also tossed a motion for dismissal. 
Both lawsuits come as the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, which controls the House, promises to thrust the Legislature into the debate over library books. The Legislature’s Joint Judiciary Committee has taken on the state’s obscenity laws as a topic to study from now until the 2026 legislative session, and conservative lawmakers will likely push for laws banning books that discuss sexuality from libraries where they can be accessed by minors. 
Librarian directors from around the state opposed a bill along those lines during the most recent legislative session. The House Judiciary Committee ultimately tabled that bill, electing to study it between sessions.
Lesley’s firing marked the culmination of two years of fierce political debate in Campbell County, during which Lesley became a target of activists opposed to LGBTQ+ literature for young people in public libraries. 
Those activists, namely the Bennett family, called for Lesley to be fired and even pressed the Campbell County District Attorney’s Office to charge her for providing obscene material to minors, according to the longer-running lawsuit, which Lesley filed in September 2023. It names as defendants Kevin, Hugh and Susan Bennett.
Prosecutors declined to bring charges after conducting what they described as an extensive review of state statutes. The county attorney found that the books in question did not meet the statute’s definition of obscene materials, which requires sexual content to also lack “serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”
WyoFile reached Kevin Bennett by phone on Wednesday, and he declined to comment.
In their response to Lesley’s lawsuit, an attorney for the Bennetts says they were exercising their own free speech rights and were not responsible for firing Lesley.
Policy debate
The Joint Judiciary Committee, which meets next month for the first time since the conclusion of the 2025 legislative session, does not have a set direction when it comes to the obscenity law topic, House chairman Art Washut, R-Casper, told WyoFile. The committee might pursue a change to criminal statutes as outlined in this year’s failed bill, or seek to “compel school districts and library boards to certify compliance in some way,” he wrote in a text message.
“It is wide open at this point, but there was strong support to rein in the idea that open access of all materials to kids is appropriate,” Washut wrote. 
Conservatives are trying to outlaw LGBTQ+ material under the guise of protecting children, said Sara Burlingame, executive director of gay-rights advocacy group Wyoming Equality. Library books that describe the experience of LGBTQ+ youth carry immense value to young people grappling with their emerging sexuality, she said, particularly in Wyoming’s rural communities and small towns. 
“Wyoming Equality supports the freedom to access books for the public,” she said. “Anything that reinforces that the public is made up of a diverse group of individuals which includes gay, lesbian, Two Spirit and transgender people, that has to be fought for over and over again.” 
The drive to create new laws targeting certain books was irreconcilable with American democratic ideals, she said. Any effort to stand up to that, like Lesley’s lawsuit, was cheered by Wyoming Equality, she said.
“People keep waiting for what the line is, and when they’re coming for books, that’s it,” she said. “That’s your cue. That’s the line.”
In the crosshairs after a long career
According to her lawsuit, Lesley spent 27 years working for the library system, and 11 as its director. “In 2021, however, the highly politicized vilification of LGBTQ+ communities and book-banning craze engulfing the country landed on her doorstep, with grave consequences,” her attorneys wrote. 
Bigotry, not genuine concern for young people, drove Campbell County activists to push Lesley out of her job, and local officials abetted them instead of standing firm for free speech and equal rights, the lawsuit alleged. 
In June, which is Pride Month, of that year, the library system made a Facebook post celebrating Rainbow Book Month — an initiative of the American Library Association, which describes it as a “nationwide celebration” of books reflecting the lives and experiences of LGBTQ+ people. That post caught the attention of two then-county commissioners, Del Shelstad and Colleen Faber, who are both defendants in this week’s lawsuit.
According to the suit, Shelstad said the county commission had not recognized Pride Month, though it is a national celebration and President Joe Biden had recognized it that year. Shelstad and Faber did not respond to WyoFile messages requesting comment.

After that, library books became a topic of frequent discussion at Campbell County Commission meetings. Hugh Bennett suggested promoting Pride Month was “the ground game of an attempt to destroy our culture and our country,” while Kevin Bennett said exposing young people to questions of sexuality was “pedophilic” and would drive increases in drug addiction and suicide, according to the complaint.
“The Bennetts and other activist residents voiced explicit anti-LGBTQ+ rationales for their requests to remove books, virulently vilifying LGBTQ+ individuals,” the lawsuit read.
At another meeting, former lawmaker Scott Clem, who is now on the Campbell County Commission, said the library was “promoting the basest of base things in our society,” the complaint read, and urged the county not to “promote animalistic behaviors.”

In 2021, the library board backed Lesley, supporting her efforts to promote Rainbow Book Month, according to the lawsuit. 
Lesley’s hiring of a magician further inflamed Campbell County’s conservatives. The magician, who was hired to perform shows at the Wright and Gillette branches, is transgender, though her gender identity was not part of her planned act, which was instead a simple magic show for children. The show did not touch on LGBTQ+ issues at all, the magician said at the time, and Lesley has said the performer was not hired because she was transgender. 
Library staff did not in fact know the magician was transgender until someone in Campbell County dug into her background, according to the lawsuit. But Shelstad, Clem and others fixated on the magician’s gender identity, according to the lawsuit.
Eventually, the magician cancelled the shows, citing safety concerns. 
Controversy, then firing 
Throughout 2021 and 2022, the Bennetts and others sought to get some books removed from the library or move them into a certain area inaccessible to minors. Lesley and the library board continued to rebuff those efforts, saying it would be illegal censorship. 
Over time, however, the county commission replaced the library board with people, like Sage Bear, who were more determined to censor certain books, and who opposed Lesley’s stance. In March 2022, a deputy county attorney sought to warn Shelstad that appointing a board with the goal of removing LGBTQ-friendly books and firing Lesley could expose the county to a lawsuit.
“Litigation regarding censorship — which is waiting in the wings on all sides — would be cripplingly costly, time consuming, and very likely unsuccessful for the County,” the attorney wrote, according to a copy of her email included in the lawsuit.
But by July 2023, the board was dominated by people opposed to Lesley’s actions, and she was fired in a 4-1 vote. At the board’s request, her replacement created a special section in the library for the challenged books, according to the lawsuit. 
Lesley’s lawsuits have the support of the Wyoming Library Association, which represents the state’s librarians. “Terri dedicated her career to providing library services to her community,” the group’s president, Lindsey Travis, wrote in a statement to WyoFile. 
Wyoming libraries do not hold materials that are legally considered obscene, Travis said, and “we believe that only parents and guardians have the right to decide what materials are best for their own children.” 
Travis hopes Lesley’s lawsuit will get the attention of the state’s politicians, she said, and “encourage lawmakers to better understand the purpose of their local libraries, to see how libraries hold essential roles in their communities, and to support the ways libraries and librarians uphold the tenets of the First Amendment.”

To preserve political parties in Wyoming, party leaders should follow the law, guest columnist David Hill opines.
The post Keep the kite flying appeared first on WyoFile .","I have often heard the story of the young boy flying a kite with his dad. Together they watched as their kite flew higher and higher. Eventually, the kite ran out of string, and the boy encouraged his father to let the string go so the kite could continue to rise. The dad explained that if he let go, the kite would fall. 

Opinion

The boy persisted, and eventually the dad agreed to let the string go. Immediately, the kite began to fly erratically and soon fell to the ground. The dad then explained to his son that although the string appeared to keep the kite from going higher, it was the string that kept the kite anchored and in the air.
Like the string that allows the kite to fly by providing an anchor and direction, so too does the rule of law keep society aloft.
Unfortunately, I have seen instances when groups have tried to evade the rule of law to fly without restrictions. One notable example is the recent elections of officers for the Park County GOP. 
On March 13, the Park County GOP came together for the election of its executive committee. This was done even though members of the executive committee knew there hadn’t been proper statutory notice of 10 days under W.S. 22-4-105. Before the vote started, a point of order was brought stating since there had not been proper notice, the election could not take place. A motion to suspend the bylaws requiring notice was made, but the motion was ruled out of order because state statute requires the notice, and statutes cannot be suspended. The election was rescheduled for March 31.
On March 31, the party reconvened — this time with proper statutory notice — to elect officers. While adopting voting rules, a motion was made to follow the state statute, which prohibits individuals from voting if they are not precinct committee people. The statutes regarding voting in these elections have been interpreted by the Wyoming Supreme Court to specifically restrict unelected executive committee members from voting. However, members of the executive committee presented a decision by the Wyoming GOP Dispute Resolution Committee claiming that statutes cannot control political parties. A motion was made to exclude the unauthorized people from voting because the party could not suspend state statute (much like the ruling made on March 13), but the motion was killed by the executive committee without a vote.
Why does this matter?
In Wyoming, political parties are specifically recognized by statute. As such, these bodies have certain privileges and rules that other social groups do not have. Two prime examples of the privileges of political parties are the ability to nominate candidates to fill vacant elected offices, like a county assessor, superintendent of public education, state treasurer or U.S. senator, and the use of public ballots to select their precinct representatives. To balance these privileges, political parties are required to follow basic statutory requirements.
Sadly, our political parties appear to fight against statutory control, arguing that they are merely a social club like the local Elks Lodge. At the same time, political parties are uninterested in relinquishing the same statutory powers that set them apart from groups like the Elks. 
However, if political parties are in fact no different from other local social clubs, it would be surprising if statutes were not amended to remove the constraints AND privileges political parties currently have. Followed to its logical end, removing political parties from our statutes would prohibit them from selecting nominees when filling vacant elected offices, resulting in a different process to fill vacancies like special elections. Primary elections would likely become more open like California’s “jungle primaries”, and parties would not be allowed to use public ballots for selecting their precinct representatives.
Perhaps some aim to remove parties from politics — an idea that George Washington likely would have supported. However, for those who do not want to see the systematic dismantling of political parties in Wyoming, I suggest we make one thing a priority: follow the law!
Just as a kite cannot have its string cut and refuse to obey the laws of physics, society cannot function to its fullest potential without laws. As for political parties, we cannot become so accustomed to our lofty privileges that we are willing to cut the statutory strings that attach us to society and not expect any consequences.

His message to lawmakers was simple: listen to individuals’ stories about […]","Universities of Wisconsin President Jay Rothman and UW-Madison Jennifer Mnookin told lawmakers that the DEI practices throughout the system are constantly evolving. President of the Dane County NAACP chapter Greg Jones was the only member of the public to testify at a Joint Audit Committee hearing Tuesday on two recent audits into the diversity, equity and inclusion practices of state agencies and the Universities of Wisconsin. His message to lawmakers was simple: listen to individuals’ stories about the impact of diversity, equity and inclusion programs and stay away from politicized attacks on DEI. 
“If the question is about whether DEI is functioning or not, whether it’s effective or not, then do it — assess it, examine it and make the case, but don’t let the politicized environment we now face become an issue of concern,” Jones said. 
Jones told lawmakers on the committee about his own experience working in what was then known as the American Ethnic Coordinate office at UW-Eau Claire many years ago. His responsibilities in that “first iteration for the stuff called DEI, belonging and so forth” was ensuring that African-American, Native American, Hispanic American and white students were comfortable on campus. 
“It caused me to do a lot of different things. I worked with them to facilitate transportation back home to Kenosha, Racine when they lost a family member, helped them get that money from the financial aid office, advocated for them with English teachers who wouldn’t accept Black English as a… method of communication in the class, even when writing poetry, short stories, or any other literary form,” Jones said. 
Jones added that these efforts helped students succeed in school and were designed to accomplish similar goals to the many DEI initiatives across UW campuses today. 
“They’re trying to do the same thing: make those students, who don’t live in those communities, are not from those communities, who don’t relate culturally, racially, ethnically, economically to members of that community, [feel] comfortable.”
Jones’ comments came after four hours of back and forth between the leaders of the state Department of Administration (DOA) and the University of Wisconsin system, who defended their DEI practices, and lawmakers on the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. Republicans on the committee pressed the leaders on the results of recent audits and criticized DEI efforts saying they are “racist” and do not benefit the state.
Republican lawmakers launched the audits into DEI practices last year after getting concessions from the UW system on cutting back DEI in 2023. The lawmakers then expressed their intent to continue targeting and trying to eliminate diversity programs. 
The audit results, which were released earlier this month, come as Republican lawmakers have felt emboldened by a U.S. Supreme Court decision that ended consideration of race in admission processes and as the Trump administration has made targeting and eliminating DEI efforts, especially in K-12 and higher education, one of its top priorities. According to a recent poll by Pew Reseach Center, 54% of Americans disapprove of the Trump administration’s actions to end DEI in the federal government, while 44% approve. 
Committee co-chair Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) opened the hearing on the audits by attacking diversity, equity and inclusion, saying that it “abandons the pursuit of a colorblind society” and demands “stereotyping.” He said the audits “expose the waste and unconstitutionality of rebranded discrimination based on immutable characteristics.”

Wimberger added he would be seeking information from leaders on how the practices would be “abandoned” or how each DEI initiative “satisfies a compelling government interest and is narrowly tailored to accomplish that interest.”
The DOA audit focused on actions that have been taken in accordance with Executive Order 59, which Gov. Tony Evers signed in 2019 to instruct state agencies to create equity and inclusion plans. Auditors analyzed how much is spent by agencies for DEI activities, including for staffing, and reviewed reported outcomes resulting from DEI activities.
The audit found that none of the 24 state agencies tracked the amount they were spending on DEI, though the audit attempts to estimate some of the costs. According to the audit in 2023-24, agencies spent $2.16 million for salary costs for positions with job duties pertaining to DEI, $705,300 for salary costs for time spent attending diversity, equity, and inclusion training required by the executive order, $444,300 on costs for completing certain actions listed in equity and inclusion action plans and $200,200 for salary costs for time spent attending meetings of DEI committees.
It also found that agencies did not consistently document that they had corrected issues of noncompliance that DOA had identified, and that DOA did not consistently require agencies to take corrective action. The audit recommended that DOA improve its monitoring efforts and ensure that it comply with the executive order and other statutory and administrative rules related to affirmative action. 
The UW audit found that UW institutions planned DEI activities and programs mostly at an institutional level, and not across the board. There is no system wide definition of DEI and implementation of DEI activities were left up to the decision of each institution.
The UW audit similarly found that spending related to DEI was not specifically tracked across the system. According to the audit during the 2023-24 fiscal year, there were $40,221,000 in costs for UW offices with duties pertaining to DEI, $12,484,900 in estimated salary costs for positions with duties related to DEI and $7,911,900 in working on certain diversity, equity, and inclusion activities listed in selected strategic plans and diversity, equity, and inclusion plans.
Republicans expressed contempt for DEI related programs and practices repeatedly throughout the hearing.
Sen. Chris Kapenga (R-Delafield) said at one point that he was “encouraged by the lack of implementation” of Evers’ executive order.
“The programs are disgusting. It’s racist,” Kapenga said. 
Democrats on the committee rejected Republicans’ characterizations of DEI — defending the practices and also seeking to understand the cost of the audit itself, which took 10 months to complete and included extensive interviews by the LAB of the agencies and UW institutions to compile the information included.
Rep. Sequanna Taylor (D-Milwaukee) said that DEI practices are not meant to be racist. 
“It is meant to be a step … so that we ensure everyone is successful in their learning opportunities,” Taylor said.

Sen. Melissa Ratcliff (D-Cottage Grove) asked LAB how much money was spent preparing the report.
State Auditor Joe Chrisman said the LAB spent about $423,000.
DOA says practices help recruit new state employees 
In her testimony, DOA Secretary-designee Kathy Blumenfield said that her agency’s  DEI practices have been beneficial for recruiting and retaining employees. 
Blumenfield also reminded lawmakers that a year ago when lawmakers were launching the audit she told them it would be hard because the work of DEI “isn’t done exclusively by one agency, nor is it a program staffed by specific employees with policies and procedures.” She brought up concerns about the methodology of the audit, saying that the audit likely overstated costs.
One example, Blumenfield said, was in relation to town hall events that were hosted by the Department of Workforce Development. The audit lists the events as costing $165,400 in 2023-24, however, Blumenfield said DEI wasn’t the main focus. 
“The content of these meetings included a wide variety of other topics unrelated to [the executive order]… Only 12% of the town hall meeting could be associated with [the executive order], which would equate to a cost of only $19,800 — reducing [the agency’s] total estimated cost by 86%,” Blumenfield said. 
Blumenfield also said that many of the activities and positions that were covered in the audit existed in previous administrations and were already required by state law — before the Evers executive order. 
Blumenfield said she thinks DEI practices have been beneficial to the state and that “luckily” the audit didn’t opine on whether DEI was good or bad. 
“This was very, very difficult and very, very challenging,” Blumenfield said, adding that she sees the audit as actually “telling us to lean in more to this work.” 
“If you look at the actual recommendations out of the audit, it’s saying do more in this space,” Blumenfield continued. 
Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said he is concerned with whether the audit finds the agency  complies with the law and DEI programs are a good use of state resources. He said he couldn’t “wrap my head around” why the state needs DEI to recruit candidates. 
Blumenfield said that DOA is complying with the law and that the agency is trying to explore ways, including nontraditional ones, to ensure the workforce represents the people of Wisconsin better.
“What you just said there is super important because you didn’t say we want our applicants [to be] a little more diverse,” Born said. “You said you want the workforce… How do you make it look more like the state if you’re not hiring people based on race … gender or whatever?”
DOA legislative advisor Cara Connors responded that outreach is important. 
“Historically, you had folks who didn’t even apply to state jobs,” Connors said. She added that outreach was “not because we need to put a thumb on the scale in the hiring process and look at race. It was that we needed to get these people to apply to jobs in the first place.”
One example they used to illustrate the point is outreach to female engineers. 
“Female engineers are really hard to come by. [The Public Service Commission] has a really hard time just retaining and recruiting engineers, so they’ve sent their female engineers to the career fairs and all of a sudden they’re attracting more female engineers,” Blumenfield said. “This isn’t rocket science.”
In response to a question from Rep. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown), Blumenfield clarified that there are no quotas for these programs. 
“If I’m at a career fair and I’m a woman and I don’t see anyone that looks like me, you know, I might not be as excited to apply with that organization as if I see someone that I can see myself in,” Blumenfield said. 
Knodl asked whether there are any engineer positions currently open.
“Are there male engineers available to fill those spots? Are you keeping them open for female engineers?” Knodl asked.
“No we don’t do that,” Connors responded. Blumenfield asked if he knew any engineers, and Knodl said his son is an engineer.
Wimberger argued that by implementing DEI programs, people are presuming things about people based on “immutable characteristics.” 
“Respectfully, Senator, I think this committee is conflating this idea of what DEI is with what’s actually happening at the state agencies,” Connor said. “What’s happening at the state agencies is what the secretary is describing. It’s this effort to recruit and retain talent in line with [several factors].” She used the example of the American with Disabilities Act, noting that it’s an anti-discrimination law.
“If I’m building a building, and I have multiple floors, I have to have an elevator, I have to have ramps,” Connors said. 
“If I wanted to help people with disabilities, would I build a ramp?” Wimberger asked. 
“If you want them to access your building,” Connors said. 
“Not if their disability isn’t related to mobility,” Wimberger shot back.
Sen. Melissa Ratcliff asked about the time the agencies spent complying with the audit.  
Blumenfield said they spent over 600 hours — or more than 75 eight-hour work days.
“That took us, actually, away from the work that we were doing to try and achieve a lot of the outcomes,” Blumenfield said.
UW leaders say DEI efforts focused on student success
Universities of Wisconsin President Jay Rothman and UW-Madison Jennifer Mnookin told lawmakers that the DEI practices throughout the system are constantly evolving and are  important to student success. 
Rothman said he has come to think of DEI as “a broad concept that includes differences in political ideology and religious beliefs, first generation status, disabled status, veteran status, in addition to those who would come from historically underrepresented groups” and that UW’s  focus is “on each individual student as an individual to ensure their success as a student and to ensure that they leave our universities with enhanced level of cultural competency.” 
Wimberger asked about whether UW-Madison has scholarships that consider race.
 
Mnookin said that while it was considered as a “modest” factor in admissions before the U.S. Supreme Court decision, that is no longer the case. She added that the U.S. Supreme Court decision does not directly speak to scholarships and that there are a few exceptions to this at UW-Madison because of some state statutes.
“Nobody is getting a scholarship from UW Madison on the basis of the racial preference,” Mnookin said. “We also are no longer accepting new scholarships from donors that call out identity characteristics in that way.”  
Some Republican lawmakers also asked about LaVar J. Charlteston, the UW-Madison chief diversity officer who was demoted from his position due to financial concerns including “highly atypical and excessive spending across multiple dimensions — from bonuses to compensation adjustments to travel, supplies and furnishings.” Wimberger asked if UW would fill the position he left vacant. 
Mnookin said she has a new part-time advisor, but it is not the same. 
“It is not at all the same role that Dr. Charlteston had,” Mnookin said. “We were trying to think about what does pluralism look like? How do we create a culture where conversations across our differences, no matter your identity or no matter your beliefs, are something that is happening?”
Mnookin said they are also working on implementing new financial controls with consultation from Deloitte to help prevent further occurrences like this.
“I don’t begrudge you for doing that,” Wimberger said. 
Rep. Robert Wittke (R-Caledonia), who expressed concerns about the variety of DEI definitions on campus, asked Rothman what the system is going to do to work on setting a standard across campuses.
“There was the sense coming out of the audit that we didn’t have a sense of what’s going on. I don’t think that’s a fair characterization,” Rothman said.
During the hearing, Rothman commended Mnookin for her work, particularly naming the Deliberation Dinners she has hosted, which are an opportunity for students to participate in conversations about controversial issues. Mnookin said it is part of their work to make people feel included on campus.
“Part of what we are trying to create — and, Senator, I acknowledge that we have further work to do — is a place where, whatever your background or your identity you can feel comfortable sharing perspectives,” Mnookin said.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Day two of former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada’s federal corruption trial ended with a jury chosen and indications of how defense lawyers could try to keep their client out of prison. 
Casada and his former chief of staff Cade Cothren are on trial for allegations of conspiracy, fraud, money laundering, bribery and kickbacks after funneling contracts for political consulting services for state House members to a company founded by Cothren called Phoenix Solutions. 
Casada’s attorney Ed Yarbrough questioned prospective alternate jurors Tuesday about whether they have worked in sales, received commissions in exchange for work — raising the question of whether commissions and kickbacks could be seen as mutually exchangeable terms — or outsourced work to subcontractors. 
“Did your customers always know who was doing the work?” Yarbrough asked. 
Federal prosecutors’ case rests partially on the premise that Casada and former Chattanooga Rep. Robin Smith secured contracts for political consulting services from House Republican Caucus members, receiving a cut of the proceeds from Cothren in return. 
Cothren resigned from his post in May 2019 amid a scandal over racist and sexist text messages that was heavily reported by Nashville-area media. He formed Phoenix Solutions in 2020 and prosecutors allege Casada and Smith purposely concealed Cothren’s identity on the assumption House members would not contract with Phoenix if they knew Cothren was behind it. 
Opening arguments will begin Thursday morning.

(Getty Images)Last week the Andrus Center at Boise State University and the McClure Center at the University of Idaho held a conference to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area. The conference focused on the legislative miracle that led to the preservation of the deepest canyon in North America.
This stunning canyon, used by jet boaters, rafters, hikers, hunters and many more, could not have been saved from the construction of a large dam if it weren’t for many persistent Idahoans who opposed the dam.
But it also took the strong bipartisan and visionary leadership of political leaders who came together to pass the legislation that became the Hells Canyon Recreation Area – namely Democratic U.S. Sen. Frank Church and Republican U.S. Sen. Jim McClure of Idaho and Oregon Republican U.S. Sens. Bob Packwood and Mark Hatfield.
It also could not have been protected without the leadership of Idaho’s Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus, and Oregon’s Republican Gov. Tom McCall, and Washington’s Republican Gov. Dan Evans. Their personal relationship and political collaboration on Hells Canyon and other issues led the press to dub them the “three Musketeers.”
Collaboration by Oregon, Idaho and Washington’s ‘Three Musketeers’ led to golden age of governors

Many of the conference speakers, including me, concluded that if another major, regional issue like Hells Canyon arose today there is not the bipartisan and deep personal relationships that could resolve it like the ones 50 years ago.  
But in retrospect, there is one thing that could potentially create the kind of leadership these amazing leaders provided in the early 1970s – saving our public lands from being auctioned off to the highest bidder. But, even then, it would require a change of heart from most of our current lawmakers or the election of more pro-public land political leaders.
 Public lands facing greater threat than any other time in U.S. history

Today we are facing the greatest threat to our public lands than at any time in history. The feeling of dread was demonstrated a few weeks ago when an estimated 2,000 Idahoans rallied at the Statehouse demanding that the Trump administration and Congress keep their hands off our public lands.
Their concern is real.
Politico recently reported that Congressional Republicans are looking at selling off public lands around the national parks to help finance President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda, including a $5 billion income tax cut. 
On April 3, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright announced that the Trump administration plans to make 16 sites on federal lands available to private companies to build artificial intelligence data centers. One of those sites is the Idaho National Laboratory near Idaho Falls. 
Last Sunday an opinion writer for The New York Times suggested that federal lands near cities could be used to expand badly needed housing. He cited “Boise” as one of those cities. Of course, he wrote there should be sideboards to prevent this land from just being used to build the kind of McMansions we see cropping up across the West. 
Idaho Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo recently voted against an amendment that would prevent the selling of public land. It failed on a 48-51 vote, meaning Risch and Crapo’s votes sank it. Meanwhile, Congressman Mike Simpson split from the rest of the Idaho delegation supporting the bipartisan Keep Public Lands in Public Hands legislation.
Utah last year sued the federal Bureau of Land Management to force the agency to turn over 18 million acres of so-called “unappropriated” lands to the state. The word “unappropriated” is the kind of misleading buzzword privatizers have used to advance other efforts such as privatizing public schools.
In this case, “unappropriated” implies that these lands are not being used, and the state should take them back. The truth is that these lands are used for grazing, mining, wildlife habitat, recreation, and many other uses. 
The U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected the Utah case. But Utah Gov. Spencer Cox is on a mission to make the transfer happen, even threatening to file a lawsuit in federal district court.

Cox has also launched a $1 million public relations campaign called “Stand for Our Land,” implying that somehow these lands owned by all Americans are under threat. His message has appeared on billboards, in TV commercials and in The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, hoping to build public support for the idea. 
And if you think this is just a threat from Utah, consider that Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador joined Cox last year by filing a brief to get these “unappropriated” lands transferred to the states.
 Plans to gut federal agencies like BLM, Forest Service under Trump administration

Meanwhile, President Trump and Elon Musk are gutting the federal agencies responsible for managing the BLM, U.S. Forest Service, and national park lands. Agricultural Secretary Brooke Rollins was quoted in Government Executive News recently as saying department employees, including those in the U.S. Forest Service, should expect significant layoffs in the coming weeks. She said the layoffs will make the Forest Service “more efficient.”
Plans include reducing the regional Forest Service offices from 10 to as few as three. It also includes laying off workers in the Forest Service’s research division, including employees conducting fire suppression, reforestation, and water research. And it includes reducing the number of national forests by consolidating them. 
President Trump has already issued an executive order declaring an “emergency situation” on national forests. The plan is to bypass environmental laws and cut 25 percent more timber. If you look at a map of the land mass that will be impacted by this executive order, it covers Idaho like a blanket from north of Boise to the Canadian border.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little calls for increase in federal forests management to reduce wildfire risk

These expected layoffs in the Forest Service will make it more difficult for the remaining employees to manage the extensive public lands in the West. No doubt the so-called “emergency” will lead to a denigration of the land and a reduction in service to the millions of Americans who hike, fish, hunt, snowmobile, and graze livestock on these lands. 
This denigration of the lands and the negative service citizens experience from these staffing cuts will set the table for the privatizers to come in with the “solution” to the very problem they created. That “solution” will be turning our public lands over to the states or selling them outright to wealthy elites who can afford them. 
This playbook is the same one that has been used to privatize public education in our country. For years billionaires and their mis-named front organizations like Besty DeVos’ American Federation for Children and Charles Koch’s Americans for Prosperity have declared that our public schools are “failing” our children. Then they come in with the “solution” – privatize education by providing vouchers to private and religious schools.
Here’s how Christopher Rufo, a far-right thought leader, explained the playbook to an audience at Hillsdale College: First “attack the credibility of the institutions.” Then create the “conditions for fundamental, structural change.” For example, he said, “to get universal school choice, you really need to operate from a position of universal public-school distrust.”  
In other words, if Cox and Labrador and congressional Republicans are going to get the public lands transferred to the states, they must convince the public that the lands are under threat. That explains Cox’s expensive “Stand for Our Land” propaganda campaign. 
The truth is that the states cannot afford to manage our public lands. The Legislature would have to appropriate millions more to expand the state Lands Department. A major fire alone would cost millions of dollars, stressing the state general fund budget.
 Under state management and privatization, the most beautiful, valuable parts of Idaho will be auctioned off

Furthermore, the Idaho Constitution mandates that state lands be managed for maximum economic gain, not for multiple uses like outdoor recreation. That’s why state-owned home sites around Payette Lake and Priest Lake have been auctioned off to the highest bidder in recent years. 
If the state gets its hands on BLM and Forest Service land, it will have to sell some of it off to cover the cost of management and fire suppression. And you can bet that it will be the most beautiful and valuable parts of Idaho that will be auctioned off. And you can also bet your last dollar that it won’t be average Idahoans who can afford to bid – it will be billionaires from Texas, California, and hedge funds back East that will gobble up our land. 
And, if you think that is far-fetched, remember the billionaire Wilks brothers from Texas who bought hundreds of square miles of Idaho from private interests and soon closed it to the public which previously had access to the land. One of those brothers, Farris Wilks, knows how the privatization game works. Last year Wilks teamed up with another Texas billionaire, Tim Dunn, to defeat anti-private school voucher Republican legislators in Texas, according to ProPublica and other news outlets.  
Recent Idaho political history shows that out-of-state billionaires like DeVos have outsized power and bottomless bank accounts to change our Legislature and advance their school privatization agenda. They could use the same strategy and bank accounts to advance the privatization of our public lands.
We cannot let the wealthy privatizers, or their complicit politicians do that. We need visionary leaders like Idaho’s Sens. Frank Church and Jim McClure and governors like Andrus, McCall, and Evans more now than ever. 
Our public lands are what makes Idaho special and different from states like Kansas where there is no public land or wild and scenic rivers. Or Texas where one must pay to play. Or some eastern states where there are more concrete slabs than wild forests and valleys.
Our public lands are what makes Idaho, Idaho. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to protect our public lands and give them and their children the same opportunities to renew their spirits under the bluebird skies of our great state.

(Source: Entergy Arkansas)Two coal-fired power plants in Arkansas are exempt from revised air pollution rules under a Trump administration rollback of environmental standards adopted last year, leaving some former EPA officials and environment groups concerned about prolonged exposure to unhealthy emissions.
The exemptions will last for two years, long enough to keep one plant already slated for closure from having to install equipment required by the new rules.
As part of its deregulation efforts, the Trump administration put out a call earlier this year for companies to request exemptions to several environmental rules finalized in Biden’s last year in office. The Clean Air Act allows the president to exempt pollution sources from compliance with any part of section 112 of the CAA if “the technology to implement the standard is not available and it is in the national security interests of the United States to do so.” 
Entergy Arkansas’ White Bluff 1 power station near Redfield and the Plum Point Energy Station near Osceola, which is owned by a consortium of utility companies, applied for the exemption.

Had President Donald Trump not directed the Environmental Protection Agency to provide the exemptions, the plants would have been required to install continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) to measure the amounts of particulates released into the air. The plants also would have been subject to stricter regulations for how much particulate matter they could release through their stacks.
Instead, the plants will only be subject to the version of the rule prior to the 2024 revisions. The plants now have until 2029 to comply with the requirements finalized last year — that is, if they remain in effect.
The Mercury and Air Toxics (MATS) rule is one of more than two dozen environmental and pollution regulations being targeted for rollbacks by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin. In a statement announcing the deregulation targets in March, Zeldin said the move was a push back against “destruction and destitution” caused by EPA rules enacted in the previous administration.
The White Bluff plant is scheduled to be shut down in 2028, an Entergy Arkansas spokesperson said.
“White Bluff 1 is the only affected unit in Arkansas that may require the installation of additional equipment to meet new MATS requirements coming into effect in 2027, and that same unit is also subject to a requirement to cease burning coal at the end of 2028 under a consent decree,” Matt Ramsey said in an emailed statement. “This exemption will avoid the need to make additional MATS-related investments that increase costs to our customers so close to the cessation of coal date.
“White Bluff 1 will continue to operate under the current MATS standards, which the EPA has determined to be protective of public health with an adequate margin of safety,” Ramsey added. 
MATS matters
The MATS rule was first issued in 2012 to reduce the amount of mercury and other toxics being emitted by coal power plants. Those rules were revised in 2024, during the final months of the Biden administration, requiring all facilities subject to the rule to install CEMS monitoring while tightening the amount of “filterable particulate matter” that a coal power plant could emit.
The revised requirements slashed the amount of particulate matter a coal plant could emit by two-thirds. A fact sheet issued by the EPA last year said that 93% of existing coal plants that were not already set to close already met the revised particulate matter standard.
Particulate matter is used as a surrogate for emissions of mercury, a heavy metal, and other pollutants designated as air toxics under the federal Clean Air Act. Heavy metals can be toxic to humans, and inhaling them can lead to respiratory issues such as asthma.
“Fine particulate matter in the rule and in the science is a proxy for these heavy metals,” explained Sierra Club attorney Tony Mendoza. “So if you’re limiting fine particulate matter to a certain level, EPA found you’re reducing your emissions of mercury and arsenic and nickel.”
Mendoza said he had been surprised that the Plum Point and White Bluff facilities had requested exemptions, saying that documentation put forth by the EPA during the rulemaking process led them to believe it would not be difficult for either plant to comply with the revised rule.
“It seems that they should have been able to comply and there is some non-public reason why they’re seeking that exemption,” Mendoza said. “We were frankly a little surprised to see them on that list.”
Frustration and concern
The chair of the Sierra Club’s Arkansas chapter expressed frustration and concern over the Trump administration’s move. The Sierra Club was one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit that resulted in the consent decree that requires Entergy to shut down White Bluff and its Independence coal plant within the next ten years.
“Environmental issues tend to work kind of like co-morbidities, where air quality issues on their own might not be causing huge issues for the average Arkansan,” Erica Kriner said, “but then you add poor drinking water from hog farms disposing waste into the Buffalo River; then you add an uptick of diseases that threaten agriculture; and suddenly all of these issues start to snowball with each other.”
Kriner said it was important that Arkansas communities understand the “larger context” of what these actions can mean. She compared the attempts to roll back regulations to a car in need of repair — perhaps it could continue to run at first, but it would eventually stop working.
“Chipping away at our clean air protections may not feel like it will lead to dire consequences, but the Trump administration, the [Sarah] Huckabee Sanders administration, they rely on people not understanding the long-term consequences of dismantling these regulations,” Kriner said.
The exemption from complying with the revised rule was particularly concerning for Joe Goffman, who oversaw the 2024 revisions as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency’s air office during the Biden administration and helped author the section of the Clean Air Act that gave the EPA the authority to regulate so-called “air toxics,” such as mercury, in 1990.
Goffman said the MATS rule exemptions for coal-powered plants would allow these facilities to continue using less frequent testing to demonstrate compliance with the pre-2024 version of the standards, which they are still subject to, if they had not already begun using CEMS.
Goffman said this leaves room for inaccuracies and potentially even manipulation.
“I can say from my many decades of experience in this area — if there was one pollutant” that Congress decided to regulate, “the pollutant to target is PM [particulate matter], because that’s the most dangerous pollutant that makes people sick,” Goffman said. 
That’s because harmful substances – like mercury – “ride” on fine particles.
“A lot of these substances are carried by fine particles,” Goffman said. “In other words, you don’t have these free floating nickel molecules or other heavy metal molecules. They ride on fine particles. That’s what makes them particularly lethal.”
Without a CEMS monitoring mandate for all coal plants, Goffman said, there could be “a lot” of particulate matter that is being emitted that isn’t necessarily reflected in reporting.

Tariffs meant to encourage U.S. manufacturing could have the opposite effect because many materials are imported from China. (Courtesy of Sumuri LLC)Steve Whalen loves his home state of Delaware and he’s proud to manufacture computers there that police officers use to “catch bad guys.” He said tariffs on imports from China and other countries, along with sharp cuts to government spending and the winding down of a program for small manufacturers, will make it harder for him to do that.
“We got into business to keep costs low for the ‘good guys,’ but tariffs or anything else that raises prices keeps us from doing that,” said Whalen, co-founder of Sumuri LLC in Magnolia, Delaware, which makes computer workstations for police and government investigations. Whalen has to buy materials overseas, often from China, and he said the tariffs could force him to triple his price on some workstations to $12,000.
Tariffs are the main tool President Donald Trump is wielding to try to boost manufacturing in the United States, calling the achievement of that goal “an economic and national security priority.” But the higher levies have led to retaliation and suspended shipments, and Whalen said they are just one of several Trump administration actions squeezing his small manufacturing business.
The wave of federal spending cuts, which has affected grants to state and local governments, could make his customers put off purchases. And the administration has moved to cut off funding for a $175 million state-based program that provides expert advice to smaller factories like his.
The Delaware version of that program, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, helped Sumuri fit expanded product lines into the limited space in its small-town factory.
“We were really having a tough time trying to figure out how to utilize our space efficiently,” Whalen said. “They came here and helped us organize and optimize, and it made a huge difference.”
On April 1, the Trump administration cut off funding for 10 such manufacturing programs that were up for renewal in Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wyoming. Other state MEP programs will expire over the next year.
The administration gave a reprieve to those 10 states until the end of the fiscal year after objections from Democrats in the U.S. House and Senate. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, which manages the program, extended funding for the 10 states “after further review and consideration” and will “continue to evaluate plans for the program,” said agency spokesperson Chad Boutin.
The program has come under fire from Republicans since the George W. Bush administration first tried to end it in 2009, and again during the first Trump administration, but Congress has continued to fund it. The conservative Heritage Foundation said in a 2023 book that MEP’s functions “would be more properly carried out by the private sector.”
‘Dots don’t quite connect’
Buckley Brinkman, executive director of the Wisconsin Center for Manufacturing and Productivity, which works with his state’s MEP program, said it didn’t make much sense for the administration to shutter the program as it seeks to boost the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.
“It’s one of those things where the dots don’t quite connect,” Brinkman said. “I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn’t cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things — less than $200 million a year — that’s returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury, working on a priority for the president.”
A 2024 Upjohn report found an even higher return: 17-to-1 on $175 million in the 2023 fiscal year, creating $3 billion in new federal tax revenue.
In Wisconsin, which has lost more than 138,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, some parts makers report that business is booming as manufacturers seek to avoid tariffs by finding U.S. alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, Brinkman said. But more broadly, he doubts that the tariffs will spark a manufacturing boom in the state.
“Do we want all this manufacturing back? Do we have the will to get it back? The answer to both those questions is ‘no,’” Brinkman said. “Even without the tariffs we don’t really want Americans doing a lot of those jobs that are in Chinese factories right now.”










I mean, jeez, here’s a part of government that doesn't cost a whole lot, in the grand scheme of things … that's returning 10-to-1 to the national treasury.

In Delaware, the MEP helped Sumuri manage its expansion, but unpredictable tariffs and budgets are now a bigger danger, said Jason Roslewicz, Sumuri’s vice president of business development. He’s had to devote two employees to monitoring supply lines, tariff news and competitor pricing to stay afloat.
“We went from putting things together in a basement to a 19,000-square-foot facility, doing exactly what we’re supposed to do here in the U.S., and it’s all in danger of coming apart because of this problem,” Roslewicz said.
Other small manufacturers express similar concerns. TJ Semanchin, who owns Wonderstate Coffee in Madison, Wisconsin, said his business roasting and distributing coffee is in crisis because of the tariffs.
Wonderstate’s costs have almost doubled between tariffs on imported coffee and packaging materials from China, plus a cyclical rise in coffee prices. “I’m borrowing money to pay for this and at some point we’ll have to raise prices. We’ll have no choice,” Semanchin said.

But many Republican state officials, and even some Democrats, have backed Trump’s tariff push, including Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who credited the Trump administration with “reshoring manufacturing and restoring this middle class which has been eviscerated over the last 20 years.”
“There’s dislocation in the short term, there’s long-term opportunity,” Youngkin said in an April 15 interview on CNBC. He said his state is hearing more interest from manufacturers looking to build or expand local factories since Trump took office. For instance, Delta Star recently announced a plan to add 300 jobs building power transformers in Lynchburg.
“The president has been clear that there will be some level of tariffs, and folks are coming, and that’s good for Virginia,” Youngkin said in the CNBC interview.
Virginia’s MEP program, called Genedge, claims successes in streamlining production and quality control for local factory products including TreeDiaper, an automated tree watering device made in Ashland, and for advising EDM, a Lynchburg plastic product assembler that needed more efficient production to keep overseas competition at bay. But Virginia’s MEP is one of the state programs slated to expire in the next year.
Long-term trend
The slide in U.S. manufacturing jobs has continued on and off since 1979, and many experts say tariffs will not bring them back. Despite a modest bounce back under the Biden administration, the number of manufacturing jobs has declined from nearly 20 million in 1979 to less than 13 million today, even as the total U.S. workforce has grown from 89 million to 159 million during that period.
Manufacturing faces labor shortages, with many factories operating below capacity because they can’t find enough workers, according to Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
That doesn’t bode well for a mass reshoring of factories from China and other countries, but Miller doesn’t expect that to happen anyway.
“Firms are not planning on reshoring much of the work that was offshored 20 to 25 years ago,” Miller said. “I’m not concerned about having enough workers for manufacturing jobs that would be reshored because this isn’t going to happen.”
In a 2024 survey by the libertarian Cato Institute, 80% of Americans said America would be better off if more people worked in manufacturing, but only 25% said they personally would be better off working in a factory. The Chinese government has poked fun at the idea with memes of American workers struggling to make Nike sneakers with sewing machines.
Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University, said the idea of a manufacturing rebirth is a “mirage being conjured to attract the support of workers who have been underpaid in an increasingly unequal economy for the last 40 years, and are desperate for some hope of renewed upward mobility.”
Manufacturing “isn’t the magic wand to make that happen,” McCartin said.
“What we need is to raise workers’ wages and make the economy less prone to producing inequality,” McCartin said. “That mission is not at all what Trump is about. He is dealing in stale nostalgia.”

(Photo illustration by seksan Mongkhonkhamsao/Getty Images)For the first half of his career in law enforcement, working as a police officer in South Florida, Chase Fopiano did not think cyberattacks on police agencies were a serious threat.
Many of his law enforcement colleagues were under the same impression — that since they were the most likely to investigate the attacks, there was no way cybercriminals would go after them.
By about 2015, as technology advanced and hackers became more creative, that changed, Fopiano said. Now, from the U.S. Secret Service to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, there are thousands of attempts to compromise networks or organizations every day, he said.
“A lot of those [attempts] are toward government or even police, especially because they know that we’re not as prepared as we should be,” said Fopiano, who now oversees cybersecurity as part of a regional task force.
Spanning health care facilities to court systems, states and local communities are facing a rise in cyberthreats. They include threats to critical infrastructure, increased activity from foreign actors, continued ransomware attacks and more, according to a recent report from the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
But President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order shifting some of the responsibility from the federal government to states and localities to improve their infrastructure to address risks, including cybercrimes. And federal cuts have reduced resources for state and local officials, including a cybersecurity grant program and a key cybersecurity agency.
States and localities are taking steps to address the problems, such as establishing new penalties for tampering with critical infrastructure, centralizing state IT personnel and setting standards in areas from elections to health care.
But the Trump order and federal funding cuts, a shortage of IT experts at the local level and an overall lack of preparedness could weaken their efforts.
In December, a major cyberattack forced Rhode Island to take down its online portal used by residents to obtain Medicaid benefits and SNAP, commonly known as food stamps. The personal data stolen from Rhode Island’s public benefits network — including Social Security numbers and banking information — was later found on the dark web.
In February, a “sophisticated cyberattack” hit the office of Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, which led agency officials to shut down computer systems and resort to paper court filings.










The notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.


– Samir Jain, Vice President of Policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology


Last week, hackers also breached the computer network of the Fall River School District in Massachusetts. The school district is working with third-party experts and law enforcement to determine if anyone’s personal information was targeted, according to MassLive.
In 2023, of the 48 states that participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review, a voluntary self-assessment conducted by federal agencies that examines how well governments are prepared to respond to cyberattacks, only 22 states reached or surpassed the recommended levels of security in their systems.
Cybersecurity has become increasingly important over time because more government services and data are digitized, said Samir Jain, the vice president of policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression.
But a national shortage of people with that expertise — especially at the local level — creates a challenge.
“The federal government has traditionally played at least some role in trying to fill some of those gaps,” Jain said. “And so the notion that the federal government could just withdraw and expect states and localities to step in is just not realistic.”
Local governments and law enforcement agencies also have other priorities, Fopiano said. The police need cars, guns, shields and other resources that generally take precedence over cybersecurity.
Today, Fopiano is the cybersecurity chair of the Southeast Regional Domestic Security Task Force in Florida, overseeing cyber activity from South Florida to the Florida Keys. The attacks continue to rise, he said.
“Terrorist groups are getting into cybercrime, cartels are getting into cybercrime, you have kids just learning about hacking and just fooling around,” he said. “The audience of who’s doing it has definitely expanded and led to that rise in overall cybercrime.”
Cuts to federal resources
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced a first-of-its-kind cybersecurity grant program, providing more than $1 billion in funding for states, localities, tribes and territories to address cybersecurity risks and threats.
The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program, created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, awarded $279 million to states and localities in fiscal year 2024. The Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program awarded another $18 million for tribes in its first year.
But the grant program is set to expire in September, with no current plans to renew it. At a hearing this month, several state and local officials urged Congress to reauthorize the program. But U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who refused the federal aid during her tenure as governor of South Dakota, questioned the program’s efficacy.
The Trump administration is also cutting as many as 1,300 employees from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, which administers the grants alongside the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The program has allowed states to assess the security of their networks, develop cybersecurity training, implement multi-factor authentication features — which requires users to provide more than one form of verification to access a site or service — and much more, said Alex Whitaker, the director of government affairs at the National Association of State Chief Information Officers.
“This has been a really great program because we’re seeing a lot of great evidence for how states and their counterparts in local government are improving their cyber defenses,” Whitaker said.
Counties also rely on a number of federal resources to strengthen their defenses, including services provided by CISA, said Rita Reynolds, the chief information officer at the National Association of Counties and managing director for County Tech Xchange. NACo is an organization that represents county governments across the United States.
The Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, for instance — a key collaboration between CISA and the Center for Internet Security to help state and local governments with cybersecurity operations — lost some of its federal funding for certain programs last month, Reynolds said.
In trying to keep up with emerging threats, counties are still trying to find resources to help them implement multi-factor authentication, convert government pages to “.gov” domains and other methods of protecting their infrastructure, she said.
“Are counties prepared?” Reynolds asked. “I would say they’re not as prepared as they’d like to be. And in some cases, they are looking at how to strategically approach this now that resources are disappearing.”
In a statement, CISA spokesperson Jared Auchey said Trump’s executive order empowers state and local governments “to make risk-informed decisions and investments to improve their preparedness.” The agency will work with state and local officials to ensure they have the information and support they need, Auchey added.
Lawmakers step up
In 2024, 33 states adopted resolutions or enacted legislation regarding cybersecurity, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan public officials’ association.
Many of those measures sought to protect states’ critical infrastructure, including water systems, government services, health care and more. Florida, Louisiana, West Virginia and other states created new criminal and civil penalties for people who attempt to tamper with critical infrastructure.

In Minnesota and Washington state, lawmakers passed measures allowing or requiring state and local governments to invest in cybersecurity protections related to election administration. Connecticut and Florida also passed legislation to secure health care facilities from cyberattacks by having hospitals create plans or by supporting investments in new technologies.
Other states are looking for solutions from outside vendors. South Dakota has set aside $7 million for a company to examine local governments for vulnerabilities to hackers.
With attacks occurring at every level of government, New Mexico Democratic state Sen. Michael Padilla, the Senate majority whip, sponsored legislation in 2023 to create the state’s office of cybersecurity. As chair of the Senate Science, Technology and Telecommunications Committee for 10 years, he plays a significant role in most of the state’s cybersecurity legislation.
Through the committee’s work, Padilla says New Mexico is in good shape to fend off cyberattacks — and the state’s cities and counties are joining in.
“I think New Mexico is in a very good position because what we decided to do by creating that office is to ensure that any transactions that occur with state government here [in New Mexico] have to meet a minimum set of security standards,” he said.
In Indiana, Republican state Sen. Liz Brown filed legislation that would encourage state agencies and groups to develop cybersecurity policies. The bill was approved by both chambers, with the Senate agreeing to changes sent from the House.
“You have to protect your infrastructure,” Brown said. “We don’t want utility systems to be shut down. We don’t want wastewater or freshwater treatment plants or even the water supply being contaminated or harmed in some way. Our systems all have backups, but even so, we know there are bad actors.”
Some states are also preparing to reshuffle their offices or create new ones to centralize their cybersecurity efforts. Arkansas, for example, enacted legislation this month to create a new state cybersecurity office, which will monitor the state’s computer networks and respond to cyberthreats.
In Alabama, rather than having information technology people scattered throughout the government, Republican state Rep. Mike Shaw wants cybersecurity personnel centrally managed.
Shaw’s legislation, which passed the House and is currently in the Senate, would give the Alabama Office of Information Technology central authority to maintain the needs of all of the state’s departments.
The centralization would make it easier to pursue cybersecurity initiatives in the future, Shaw said.
“The federal government is really big, and it’s really hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution for things like cybersecurity, data privacy and technology in general,” Shaw said. “So, in some sense, it’s good that the states are coming up with their own.”

Kneeling on the cold bathroom floor of her apartment, Kisha clutched the pregnancy test she had just picked up from the Walgreens down the street. She waited for a single blue line to appear. Instead, there were two.
“When I looked down at that test, I didn’t believe it,” she said. “I told myself there was just no way. This can’t be happening to me.”

She was pregnant at 41 years old.
With no partner to support her and no financial cushion to fall back on, living paycheck to paycheck, she couldn’t afford to raise a child alone and had no desire to.
Working long shifts for an online retailing company, loading packages for $20 an hour, Kisha was facing a reality that she did not expect — and could not afford.
“I knew exactly what my next steps would be,” she said.
That step would be an abortion.
As the Trump administration moved to pause Planned Parenthood’s funding and a federal court ruled against criminalizing doctors in Alabama for helping patients seek abortions across state lines, Black women in the South are sounding the alarm, organizing to defend what’s left of their reproductive freedom.

But living in South Carolina, where a law bans abortions around six weeks of pregnancy, Kisha said she felt like her next steps were under threat. Earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments about whether her state could cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. That decision will not come until this summer.
The fear has only intensified since the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established federal protections for abortion. By giving states the right to restrict or ban abortions altogether, the ruling created a new legal landscape that abortion rights advocates say creates a particular set of hurdles for Black women who already face significant barriers to care.
Medical researchers say that the distinctive threats faced by Black women in the South include the potential for medical discrimination by health care providers, criminalization of pregnant women, and the highest rate of maternal mortality in the nation, which has only increased since the Dobbs decision.
Taken together, researchers say, those issues and others create disproportionately high risks for Black women seeking abortions when compared to their counterparts from other demographic groups.
“People need to understand that the current policies are going to, in a very material way, lead to more Black and brown women in jails, [and] more Black and brown women dying because doctors cannot provide them with the care that they swore an oath to provide,” said Dr. Karenne Fru, an Atlanta-based reproductive endocrinologist and OB-GYN. “I remind people that the biggest risk for a Black woman is getting pregnant.”
In Kisha’s case, she made an appointment at a Planned Parenthood clinic where she was able to obtain the abortion pill at a reduced cost, and found some much-needed emotional support during a time she calls one of the most gut-wrenching moments of her life.

“I didn’t feel judged,” she said. “They just saw a woman who needed help, and they gave it.”
Kisha agreed to speak with Capital B only on the condition that her last name not be used, out of fear that sharing her story publicly could lead to criminal prosecution under her state’s abortion laws — laws that place the kind of health care she received under threat.
 Abortions, health care and Planned Parenthood under scrutiny

During the first two months of the second Trump administration, the battle over reproductive rights has continued. On April 1, the Trump administration revoked Title X funding for Planned Parenthood, cutting tens of millions from clinics that provide reproductive and preventive health care.
The very next day, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review South Carolina’s attempt to exclude Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program, a decision that could significantly impact health care access for many low-income residents.
“President Trump and Elon Musk are pushing their dangerous political agenda, stripping healthcare access from people nationwide, and not giving a second thought to the devastation they will cause,” Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood, said in a statement.
Several Planned Parenthood clinics across Michigan announced their doors would be closing following the latest federal funding cuts. In addition, the cuts drew outrage from Planned Parenthood centers across the South — especially in states like Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, where strict abortion laws already make it harder for people to get care. These states also provide some of the weakest maternal health support in the nation.
“We know the chaos and terror from this administration will impact marginalized communities and people of color the most,” said Ashley Coffield, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi. “This especially puts Black women at risk.”
Abby Ledoux, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, said one of her organization’s clinics — serving Louisiana and southeast Texas — was also directly impacted.
“It’s just one in a long line of attacks. We’re doing everything we can to fill the gaps in a broken health care system,” she said.

Fru, a reproductive endocrinologist and OB-GYN, testified in March against Georgia’s House Bill 441 — a law that would ban nearly all abortions by defining life as beginning at fertilization. Her testimony went viral.
Fru’s practice is rooted in helping women conceive. But she also supports patients through miscarriages, failed pregnancies, and medically necessary abortions — highlighting how interconnected reproductive care is.
In states like Georgia, with six-week abortion bans, detecting fetal cardiac activity prevents termination, no matter the circumstances.
Fru said as many as a quarter of all pregnancies “will not make it outside of the first trimester, and at that point, you have to do a lot to prove that it was not willfully terminated.”
She explained that many of her patients have “highly desired pregnancies” — individuals who have paid for fertility treatments to conceive. But when those pregnancies become nonviable, the treatment options often involve the same medication used in abortions.
“I have to put a note at the bottom of their prescription for the pharmacist to see that says this patient has a nonviable, desired pregnancy and is in distress, please dispense the meds as written without questioning her. And the reason I do that is because I have had patients calling me crying. After all, here they’re having the worst day of their life, and now a pharmacist is asking them if they’re using the pills to perform an abortion.”
 Fighting for abortion rights in the South

Fru warns that the growing criminalization of reproductive care affects not just patients, but also the providers trying to help them.
That’s why, for many advocates, a recent federal court ruling in Alabama offered a rare moment of relief. On the same day that the Trump administration cut Title X funds, a U.S. district judge blocked a 2023 Alabama law that criminalized helping women travel across state lines to obtain legal abortions — ruling that the state could not prosecute individuals or providers for doing so.
The lawsuit was brought by a coalition, including the Yellowhammer Fund, which offers financial and logistical support to abortion seekers in the South.
The fund’s executive director, Jenice Fountain, said the group was ready to resume support the moment the ruling came down.
  “People shouldn’t have to go out of state to get health care. Abortion should be free and accessible in this state, and we aren’t there yet,” said Jenice Fountain, executive director of Yellowhammer Fund. (Tosha Gaines)
“We funded an abortion just 15 minutes after the ruling. That’s how urgent and how serious this is for the women who need our help. We can celebrate this victory for a day or two, but we have to get back to work,” Fountain said. “I’d say we are done celebrating. It’s not acceptable that the best we can do for anyone is advise or fund their care out of state. People shouldn’t have to go out of state to get health care. Abortion should be free and accessible in this state, and we aren’t there yet.”
While the judge’s ruling reaffirmed that Alabamians still have the constitutional right to travel and seek legal medical care, even if their home state criminalizes it, for Fountain, the ruling is far from enough.
“Just having Black women watch an entire system fail them is mentally and emotionally horrendous on our bodies. There’s the actual talk of us dying from a lack of health care, and it’s horrendous. And knowing that the collateral for all of this is going to be someone that looks like you. If you’re not trying to kill Black women, what are you trying to do?” Fountain said.
Advocates in other Southern states echoed her concerns. Jules, a health care executive in Tennessee who would only speak on the condition that her last name be withheld, said 60% of the people they support live in West Tennessee, where that state’s Black population is concentrated — and where many residents are low-income or uninsured.
“The Alabama ruling gives us some legal precedent to fight with,” she said. “But legislators are getting more creative with how they attack our services. We’re not in the clear.”
Alexis Alsup, a doula in Knoxville, says Black women in the rural South are often hit the hardest because there aren’t enough resources nearby. She says many also don’t know where to go for help.
For Kisha, the administration’s cuts and restrictions on abortion laws feels deeply personal.
  “Yes, we will suffer under these cuts, and we will also find ways to care for one another,” said Deon Haywood, executive director of Women With a Vision. (Anthony LaMothe Photography of New Orleans)
“This is an attack on women. If it was really about the kids, they’d be reforming foster care or adoption systems. They wouldn’t be making women responsible for systemic problems or policing our bodies,” she said. “And where are the laws that hold men accountable? We don’t get pregnant alone.”
As for her decision — the one she made with a heavy heart — Kisha says it wasn’t easy. And she knows it could’ve been her last chance to have a child.
“I felt super selfish. I couldn’t even tell my mom because I know she wants grandchildren. But I also know that I would’ve felt just as selfish raising a child in these circumstances. I had to forgive myself.”
Longtime advocate Deon Haywood, executive director of Women With a Vision, says Kisha’s story is one of many, woven into a legacy of resistance by Black women across generations.
“Yes, we will suffer under these cuts, and we will also find ways to care for one another,” Haywood said. “Black people are a passionate people, and we are filled with spirit and soul, and that’s what we bring to the streets when we’re fighting back. That’s what we bring to the halls. That’s what we bring to courthouses.
“We take it with us because it’s a part of our DNA left and shared by our ancestors. Because of that, we owe it to ourselves to stay in this fight.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Black-woman-pregnancy-test-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-24 06:07:31.228370

But the owners of Red Door aren’t so sure about some of their fellow local food growers.
The administration recently eliminated the Local Food Purchase Assistance Program and the related Local Food for Schools Program, and in the process reneged on funds already committed for this year, leaving almost 300 farmers across the state holding the bag, or, in many cases, the seeds.
At Red Door, owners Stacey and Tenzin Botsford won’t be planting the carrot seeds they ordered. “It would be bad business for me to do that,” says Stacey. “Some seeds are already planted, all the onions are, but there’s no reason for me to plant all those carrots.”
Like many other local growers, Red Door actually raises food that people eat. They’re the farmers you know at farmers markets all over the state. They’re also the farmers who help stock super markets with local foods. And, until now, they provided nutritious, locally grown fruits and vegetables to food pantries and schools.
What gets under their skin, Stacey Botsford says, is the arbitrary and capricious cutoff of funds already committed, funds that many farmers were promised and that caused many to invest in infrastructure and hire employees. “The part that really bothers me is, if next year they said, ‘We don’t value that program,’ that’s fine, but you can’t break the contract everyone signed. Now I can’t trust government contracts anymore. I cannot imagine the widespread mistrust of government from this.”
Red Door is probably diversified enough to weather the loss of up to $50,000 in anticipated income, but on a recent chilly spring day, rather than planting carrots, Stacey was searching for new markets.
She says she’s angry and heartbroken about the impact on other growers, including many Hmong farmers who invested in hoop houses and in some cases greenhouses based on projected income. “Greenhouses, you don’t own one unless you have enough to fill it. Heating those suckers is a lot of money. The LSP people were encouraging all the Hmong to build hoop houses and greenhouses. Those are huge investments.”
Local and regional foods are mainstream in most parts of Wisconsin and across the country these days. It’s been a success story of remarkable growth in the past few decades, built on the backs of farmers, many of them young, from a variety of  ethnic backgrounds. Some government assistance was available for hoop houses and other improvements, but for the most part, the growth was organic, from the ground up, without commodity payments or other government support. 
And while the local food programs were buffeted by the recent breach of contract, large commodity growers got a big boost from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to buffer them from the impacts of the Trump administration tariffs. USDA recently announced it will provide $10 billion in direct economic assistance to agricultural producers through the Emergency Crop Assistance Program EECAP for the 2024 crop year. The local foods programs were projected to cost $1 billion nationally.
The payments to commodity growers, notes Botsford, will reward farmers not to grow crops like corn and soybeans. “Government has always subsidized farms. We’ve been subsidizing farmers for years – all the commodity crops – and now they’re paying farmers not to grow crops,” while local commodity growers take their losses, she said. “So, they’re making it impossible to sell what you’ve committed to and giving conventional farms $10 billion not to grow.”
Red Door and hundreds of other farms rely on the Wisconsin Food Hub Cooperative in Waupaca to source and transport their produce. The Food Hub Cooperative is a farmer-owned business supporting the local food system. 
Tara Roberts-Turner, general manager of the Food Hub, likened the suspension of the programs and promised funding to a natural disaster. “This almost happened as fast and as crazy as a hailstorm. It pulls the legs right out from under you, and you’re left saying ‘Whoa, did that really happen?’” she says.
  Tara Turner-Roberts at Wisconsin Food Hub Cooperative.
The Food Hub serves more than 400 Wisconsin farmers, providing transportation and distribution services, along with other grower assistance. Under the LFPA program and its committed funding, the cooperative rented trucks, expanded staff, and coordinated with farmers for supply in preparation in 2025.
The food hub and its growers are working to get the program restored, but there have been few good signs. “If the LFPA is not restored, years of building the local farmer-to-market infrastructure that the Food Hub Cooperative has built for farmers with government investment will be completely thrown out the window,” says Turner-Roberts. 
The cooperative and farmer members are all businesses, Roberts-Turner says. They have business plans, investments, overhead and bottom lines. The programs eliminated by the Trump administration were built on other government efforts to support local food security, she adds. That was an investment in local businesses and communities. “If you were to look at this from a business perspective, they would realize it’s not a very sound decision. They lose all the investment they put in and cut off a bipartisan plan to make the state’s food systems more stable. I think back to when these programs were kicked off, and it was supported by both sides of the aisle,” she says, adding that their farmer members span the political spectrum.
And it’s not just food pantries and schools. Supermarket chains like Kroger, Roundy’s and other grocers buy local foods produced across the state. “Food Hub growers supply over $3 million of produce to larger grocery stories and grocery distribution in the state,” Turner-Roberts says. If the growers don’t survive, local foods will dissipate. “We’re shipping to them year-round, everything from potatoes and apples to crops like zucchini and yellow squash,” she says. “The local Piggly Wiggly here (in Waupaca) has always been about supporting local. The premise is everyone knows this is important, right? When you ask farmers to buy seeds and implements and hire employees and then cut them off, it’s going to make them less likely to participate in those programs. These farmers are members of their communities, but they’re also business people.”
Like cooperative member Stacey Botsford, Turner-Roberts says it’s a heartbreaking time, even as spring planting is under way across the state. Are there any positives? U.S. Sen. Cory Booker has sponsored legislation to honor farmer contracts. “We have not seen any Republicans who have signed on to that,” Turner-Roberts says. “I find it curious. The food hub is not a political program. Food is not political. It’s not just farmers we’re worried about. We’re two to five years into a seven-year project we have with a bunch of partners in state that have basically created middle-of-the-road infrastructure to sustain ourselves as a state, whether it’s schools, pantries, whatever. What this means is that, next emergency we have that threatens our ability to feed ourselves, we’ll have to start all over. In Wisconsin, Meanwhile, at the Food Hub, “We’ve got truck leases three years out. We have to sign leases and find a way to pay for them and hire staff.”
The food hub has farmer cooperators in all 72 counties in the state. As Botsford at Red Door notes, a lot of them are left scratching their heads. “Margins are so narrow in farming, you don’t plant $50,000 in food and not have anywhere to sell it,” she says. “I’m talking to distributors all over the U.S., in the southeast and in bigger cities. There’s a fairly significant food shortage coming, with the California fires and people who work on farms leaving because they’re scared. People are concerned about the price of food.”
These days, she’s working with neighboring Amish farmers. “I tell them I will sell their food and take a cut.” Those neighbors don’t have coolers for food storage, but Red Door does. “I say, ‘I can move your food, and I have a cooler, so bring it to my house and put it in the cooler.’ I feel very responsible to help these folks …  these people need to sell their produce.”
Tenzin Botsford is on the board of directors for Neighbors Place, a Marathon County nonprofit that was established in 1989 by several churches trying to address needs in the community. “They don’t know what to do now, how to make up the difference,” Stacey Botsford says. 
Red Door does cooperate with Cattail Organics, a neighboring farm, to supply farm-to-family food boxes through the Hunger Coalition, operated by United Way in Marathon County. But the past few weeks have been rough. “The seeds are already in the ground for a lot of the producers. We are diverse enough to pivot, but I am concerned with the smaller farms, especially the Hmong farmers in our area who were encouraged to expand, make investments, and put all their trust in this one basket of eggs. My heart is breaking for all the families who will not get the produce and I’m perplexed at how starving the poor of nutrition and gutting the farmers who are producing food is going to propel the country in a positive way. It’s not good on such a big scale.”

By 2050, severe floods that were expected to happen once every 100 years will be three times more likely to occur in the Connecticut River Valley in Massachusetts. But the uneven distribution of resources across municipalities leaves some towns less equipped to plan for and respond to disasters.
The post When the river rises appeared first on CommonWealth B[...]","On the eve of July 10, 2023, Piyush Labhsetwar, like many farmers in the Pioneer Valley region of Massachusetts, went to sleep anticipating rain. But he wasn’t prepared for what he saw the next morning, when he checked the online water gauge for the Mill River, a tributary of the Connecticut river that runs along Grow Food Northampton’s 121-acre community farm. “[The] water level was shooting straight up,” he recalled. “This doesn’t look good.” He drove to the farm and found one of the incoming roads blocked by police. The river had jumped its banks and the bridge to cross it was underwater. He found another place to cross. “Part of the farm had turned into the river. And it was not just, you know, still water,” he said. “It was like a flowing river, taking part of the farm.”  On the same day, a man was rescued from his car in a park that the Mill River had overtaken nearby. Six miles north in Williamsburg, Meekin Brook jumped its banks and rushed through the parking lot of O’Brien’s Auto Works. In Greenfield alone,142,290 gallons of untreated sewage were released into the Connecticut and Deerfield Rivers. And culverts and roads were washed out up and down the valley.  That region was hit so hard that season that the Massachusetts State Legislature appropriated $20 million to reimburse farmers for lost revenue and $15 million for municipalities impacted by storms and disasters. Over the past six decades, the Northeast has seen a 60 percent increase in precipitation during the top 1 percent heaviest rain days. By 2050, severe floods that were expected to happen once every 100 years will be three times more likely to occur in the Connecticut River Valley in Massachusetts. But the region faces multiple obstacles addressing these unfolding impacts of climate change. Uneven distribution of resources across municipalities leaves some towns less equipped to plan for and respond to disasters — and each town addresses flooding in its own silo, through town-specific comprehensive plans and infrastructure upgrades. Non-profits, planning agencies, and government officials are advocating for more coordination, including ambitious state and federal legislation that would corral the watershed community together. They say that what happens upstream affects those downstream and that everyone needs support.  “You have communities that are trying to deal with this on their own, which I understand, and at the same time, we need to think about it as a full ecosystem,” said Kimberly Robinson, executive director of the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission (PVPC), the designated regional planning body for 43 cities and towns in Hampden and Hampshire county.  Massachusetts State Senator Jo Comerford echoes the sentiment: “The river has to be seen as an entity in its whole self. … Even as municipalities protect themselves, which of course they have a right to do, … we need a coordinating body to make sure that we’re talking to each other.” Floodplains have been a site of civilization throughout human history. Joseph Graveline, advisor for the Nolumbeka Project, a northeastern tribal heritage preservation organization, points out that for millennia Indigenous people “chose to live by the river, understanding that it would flood from time to time and that they could deal with it quite nicely and move right back onto the land again afterwards.” When the river flooded, it left nutrients and silt in its wake, which was ideal for farming.  “They saw pure organic material coming down the river. Beautiful stuff,” he said.  But colonization and industrialization dramatically changed life along the river, with the first European settlements in the 1600s, the first dam construction in the late 1700s, the industrial revolution in the 1800s, and hydroelectric power and the agricultural revolution in the 1900s. The last four hundred years have led to a new relationship with the river for most people, and with the addition of climate change, what was once manageable has become a liability.  During the July 10 flood, Joe Czajkowski, whose Hadley farm grows 400 acres of fruit and vegetables, lost over $1 million dollars in crops — roughly a quarter of anticipated revenue for that year. This was food that was destined for local schools, universities, and grocery stores. Some of the crops were lost outright, but some were unsellable because they’d made contact with river water, which can expose crops to manure from upstream farms, sewage, agricultural chemicals, fuel, heavy metals, and microbial pathogens, according to the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources (MDAR).“The river has to be seen as an entity in its whole self. … Even as municipalities protect themselves, which of course they have a right to do … we need a coordinating body to make sure that we’re talking to each other.” 
– Massachusetts State Senator Jo ComerfordFour days after the flooding, MDAR issued a guide that “strongly” discouraged farmers from replanting crops that are commonly eaten raw, like salad greens, in river flooded fields within that season.  “Certain crops that live in the soil, like carrots, [we] might have been able to plant over again,” Czajkowski said. “But I didn’t think it would be smart to put them in the soil and try for a second crop or second planting, because who knows what’s in that soil from the flood waters?” Graveline has the same concerns, and questions whether his plan to grow blueberries on his land in Northfield makes sense. During Hurricane Irene, he watched “propane tanks floating down river at the speed of a speed boat,” he said. “I saw refrigerators … just everything you can imagine floating down that river. … We just don’t know what the impact is going to be short term, medium term or long term to these kind[s] of chemicals coming onto the land.” Czajkowski says that even crops out of the river’s way were inundated with rainwater. He lost more than half of his cucurbits — crops like cucumbers, squash, and peppers — to a moisture-loving soil borne pathogen called PCap, Phytophthora capsici. It’s a pernicious disease that thrives in soils saturated with water and causes fruit rot, rapid wilting, and death in many vegetables. Its “swimming spores” can travel a great distance within the soil, contaminating other fields. It also produces long-lived spores that can survive underground for years.  The July 10 flood also came at an unexpected time. Labhsetwar and many others pointed out that historically, flooding in this region is expected in the spring because of snow and ice melt, and the predictability helped. “[Farmers] would not disturb the land or till the land until that happens. So they could plan around it, because it was a more predictable event. But now with climate change, the floods are happening very erratically.” Labhsetwar said 2023 was “a crazy year” at Grow Food Northampton, with two floods in July and an even more surprising one in December. Nearly 60 percent of the state’s agricultural output in the Connecticut River watershed, leaving many concerned about the impact of climate change and its myriad ripple effects, including diseased crops, on food security. The Massachusetts Executive Office of Environment and Affairs (EEA) estimates an 8 percent decline in key commodity crops like barley, corn, cotton, hay, potatoes, rice, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat by 2030, and a 20 percent decline by 2070.  “Impacts of climate change, whether that is droughts or flooding, have a larger impact on our ability as a Commonwealth to be resilient,” said Robinson. In addition to food security, these weather events take a toll on small businesses, homes, and infrastructure. The 2022 Massachusetts Climate Change Assessment cited “urgent climate impacts” in the Connecticut River watershed, many of which were seen on July 10 and some which are predicted to unfold: damage to inland buildings from heavy rainfall, overwhelmed drainage systems, and a reduced property tax base due to inland flood risk. Todd O’Brien, owner of O’Brien’s Auto Works in Williamsburg, took out a loan to replace over $80,000 in equipment that was damaged when water Meekin Brook forced its way under the door of his garage, as well as through a fissure in the concrete floor, resulting in what he described as a “geyser.” His landlord had to replace the exterior wall that had been holding back the river.  O’Brien said insurance wouldn’t cover his equipment because the flood was “an act of god.”“We [had to] just sweep all that was left from the water and try to put our lives back together,” he said.  Todd O’Brien owns O’Brien’s Auto Works in Williamsburg, MA. In July 2023, O’Brien’s shop was flooded when Meekin Brook, which flows behind his shop, overflowed.  (Emily Glick for CommonWealth Beacon)When Meekin Brook overflowed, it flooded the parking lot and forced its way under the door of Todd O’Brien’s garage.

(Emily Glick for CommonWealth Beacon)In Northampton, an overflowing stream coupled with stormwater on roads led to the pooling of water in a low-lying neighborhood and pushed water into the first floors of single-family homes.  Carolyn Misch, the city’s director of Planning and Sustainability, said that events like the July 10 flood block access points to entire neighborhoods. Even before that summer, her department was concerned about the “people who are most vulnerable and therefore have very tenuous housing situations … [who] might be living in the lowest lying areas,” she said. Planning for climate-related emergencies for those populations is a top priority moving forward.  In November of 2024, a partnership of 16 municipalities, 13 legislators, and two regional planning agencies, including PVPC, sent a letter to EEA Secretary Rebecca Pepper urging the administration to include a $100 million fund dedicated to supporting the watershed’s health and resilience in the forthcoming environmental bond bill.  The letter noted that much of the region’s flood control infrastructure — like the Hatfield Dike — was built in the 1930s and 1940s, and while it has “protected the region from catastrophic flooding” it is “not equal to the ravages of climate change.”  Comerford, one of the letter’s signatories, told CommonWealth Beacon that she hopes the fund can also address the region’s wastewater treatment challenges. “We have many water sewer problems on the Connecticut – aging infrastructure that sends sewage into the river in huge quantities these days,” Comerford told CommonWealth Beacon. “So [we need] everything from flood control to water sewer repair, so that not only is the water not flooding farm fields and municipalities, but when it floods, it’s not then tainted with sewage.”  Robinson, also a signatory, has seen communities struggle under the weight of disaster recovery, including some that have very few paid staff and are “inundated” with calls during weather events.  “[There is] tremendous pressure on local governance,” said Robinson. “All those pressure points became really apparent” during July of 2023, when some communities had no paid staff other than a director of public works, if that, to respond.  Comferford hopes the money would directly go to communities that need to upgrade infrastructure but would also be used to create a coordinating body so that towns are not undermining each other’s efforts.  “If one municipality upstream hardens its infrastructure, puts up a big retaining wall, it’s going to change the river,” she said. “If we do this in Fairfield, what happens to Hadley and Hatfield, or Northampton? … We need that kind of coordination.” In an email to CommonWealth Beacon, Danielle Burney, a spokesperson for EEA said, “The Connecticut River Watershed, along with each of Massachusetts’ rivers, is on the frontlines of climate change, experiencing historic flooding that has devastated farmland, homes, and businesses.” In reference to the $100 million requested in the November 2024 letter, she said “We are currently developing an environmental bond bill to be filed later this spring. We look forward to sharing the significant investments that these critical authorizations will support.” The Connecticut River Partnership, a network of advocacy organizations that includes PVPC and the Connecticut River Conservancy, is also looking to the federal government for support. In July 2023, in response to the partnership’s advocacy, Sen. Jeanne Sheehan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, introduced S.2660, the Connecticut River Partnership Act, to establish a program for coordinating “restoration and protection” activities among federal, tribal, state, local, and regional entities and conservation partners throughout the watershed. (Shaheen’s office along with the Connecticut River Partnership was working on the bill before the flood, but after the devastation the importance of the bill became more apparent, said a staffer.) Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren were two of six co-sponsors, all of whom were Democrats and who represented Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The bill did not make it out of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in 2023, but Sen. Sheehan will reintroduce it this legislative cycle, said one of her staffers. The bill was also introduced in the House of Representatives with eight cosponsors, and it did not make it out of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. Kimberly Robinson, the executive director of The Pioneer Valley Planning Commission, says communities need help to deal with the flooding from the Connecticut River. “We need to think about it as a full ecosystem,” she adds. (Emily Glick for CommonWealth Beacon)While developed before the July 10 flooding, the goals of the bill included creating “water management for volume and flood damage mitigation improvements to benefit fish and wildlife habitat” and advancing “the use of nature-based solutions to maximize the resilience of communities, natural systems, and habitats under changing sea levels, storm risks, and watershed conditions.” In the meantime, cities and towns are doing much of this work on their own with support from grants and groups like PVPC. PVPC has helped 27 municipalities develop Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness (MVP) plans, which include short- and long-term planning for flood events. Andrew Levine, Hatfield’s town administrator, said a big focus of Hatfield’s plan is “making room for the river,” which, in future flood scenarios, might encroach on the town’s infrastructure and services.  “Our town facilities, much of our infrastructure, and our emergency response departments, are all within the new floodplain, and that creates some risks to us for sure that we’re trying to find ways to mitigate,” said Levine. Until last year, when an engineering team made updated floodplain maps based on preliminary FEMA data and river flow projections by University of Massachusetts, Hatfield only had access to FEMA maps from the 1970s, which do not reflect the river’s new reality under climate change.  Calculated by the engineers, the “new floodplain” is a more accurate representation of the distance the overflow of the river is expected to reach in major flood events. Hatfield’s flood management recommendations are based on scenarios in which much of its town center could be three to four feet under water in a 100-year flood — a flood that has a 1 percent chance of happening in any year.  In addition to long term considerations like moving emergency services, the town hall, and the senior center to higher land, the town plan’s short-term recommendations include inventorying and assessing culverts for upgrades.  “Everything is costly, but so is not mitigating disaster,” said Diana Szynal, chair of the Hatfield select board. Szynal said that as a small town with only a 3-person essentially-volunteer select board, they were grateful to have the support of PVPC in making their plan because “from our perspective … that’s a lot of work.”  Hatfield’s recalculated floodplain includes much of the town’s infrastructure including its emergency response departments, says Andrew Levine, the town’s administrator. (Emily Glick for CommonWealth Beacon)Hatfield is just one town, and not all municipalities have the capacity to create customized forecasts to guide their planning.   “We’ve been cobbling together resources because we don’t have what we need,” said Patty Gambarini, PVPC’s chief environment planner.  Labhsetwar, the pawpaw farmer who since the flood has become the farm and land stewardship manager at Grow Food Northampton, says that accurate maps are also important if you want to site agriculture based on a climate adaptive approach. In 2023, two of the vegetable farms that Grow Food Northampton leased land to were in the lowest lying portion of the property. One farm moved, and Grow Food Northampton decided not to renew the lease of the other. Grow Food Northampton is considering leasing the most vulnerable plots to fruit and nut tree growers.   Another challenge is that some towns are using precipitation data from the 1950’s to inform development projects and aren’t accurately accounting for stormwater runoff – a major factor that affects flooding. In 2023, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection issued new proposed regulations for the Wetlands Protection Act, including a new stormwater handbook that would require municipalities to manage stormwater based on updated precipitation data. MassDEP officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But, according to the agency’s website, changes should be finalized this spring. “Regulation on new development and redevelopment projects need to be accounting for current and potentially future rainfall to reduce risk. And relying on old rainfall data in calculations is no longer suitable,” said Gambarini.  In addition to updating regulations, towns need to be able to review projects to those standards and enforce those regulations. PVPC says this is difficult in itself, given how many towns don’t have professional staff.  “They just don’t have the capacity,” said Ken Comia, PVPC’s deputy director of land use and environment.  Gambarini says that while updated building codes are important, because they ensure that new development takes more responsibility for onsite management of stormwater, one of the most significant things a region can do is protect nature’s pre-existing systems for water absorption, like wetlands.  In a city version of that philosophy, Northampton received funding to look at five different places around the city where they could install green infrastructure, which is a way of mimicking natural processes for managing stormwater. Misch said the goal is to turn hard infrastructure, like paved areas, into “natural flood plains.” Two sites were at schools that would direct stormwater into bioswales to help prevent downstream flooding. The city now has construction designs for these projects and will continue to look for funding to implement them.  During the summer of 2023, Labhsetwar was leasing one third of an acre in the lowest lying portion of the farm. He’d picked that site because he was growing pawpaws — a fruit tree adapted to floodplains — and perennial grains as part of an experiment in resilient agriculture. On July 10, the 5-foot tree tubes were fully under water. But in the following weeks, the baby trees were doing just fine. And he was glad to see that the wheat bounced back the next year. “This is the experiment I planned for,” he’d thought.  He argues that one of the benefits of growing trees in floodplains is that the crop is less likely to be contaminated by river water than low-lying vegetables. But changing a society’s approach to agriculture and to eating habits is “slow work.” “It is like really figuring out what tree crops will work in your land, and also for people to be able to use that kind of food,” he said.  Other slow work is repairing parts of the river that have been impacted by erosion. The Connecticut River Conservancy uses root wad installations to stabilize carved out riverbends, which involves inserting a tree with a big root wad into the riverbank so that the root structure slows down that water. “One of the things humanity has been very good at is building right up to the edge of the water,” said Rebecca Todd, executive director of the Connecticut River Conservancy.  “We’ve all seen those steep creek walls that slump because the river comes whooshing around the corner,” she said. “So what we are trying to do is to revegetate some of the riparian corridors to help stabilize the area.” In the coming weeks, Gambarini will be running a round table through the MVP grant program to engage in conversations across the watershed and “accelerate” what municipalities can accomplish together. The round table will include “flood savvy technical people” from municipalities all along the Connecticut River in Massachusetts.  Comia echoes the importance of applying technical knowledge to planning. “My mantra as an urban planner is building the capacity of the people that are making decisions,“ he said. “At the end of the day, my hope is that [these towns] are making decisions based on the best information that’s out there, even if it is scary.”The post When the river rises appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/970B6467-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-04-24 10:45:51.964030
